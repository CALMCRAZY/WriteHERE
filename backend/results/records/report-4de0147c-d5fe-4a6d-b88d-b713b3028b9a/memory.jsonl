Introduction\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare, exploiting machine learning (ML) algorithms, data analytics, and automation, is enduring a paradigm transition by improving medical decision‐making, diagnosis, and treatment outcomes, with the potential to boost productivity, care quality, and ease costs [1]. The delivery, administration, and patient experience of healthcare are all being completely transformed by the advancement of AI‐driven technology and further its integration into existing systems [2, 3]. This in‐depth study looks at how AI is significantly impacting the healthcare sector, improving diagnostic precision through data analysis, streamlining treatment planning through predictive algorithms, and shedding light on how these advancements are challenging accepted wisdom and setting new benchmarks for quality [3, 4, 5]. Najjar (2023) showcased AI's revolutionary potential in several healthcare sectors. In diagnostics, AI‐powered diagnostic tools have shown remarkable accuracy in diagnosing diseases including cancer, heart issues, and neurological disorders, particularly in the area of medical imaging. These technologies frequently outperform human clinicians in this regard [6]. Their speed and precision have frequently surpassed that of human professionals. ML algorithms scan vast amounts of data from imaging studies, genomes, and medical records to identify patterns and predict patient outcomes, enabling earlier and more accurate diagnosis [4]. In addition to improving patient outcomes, AI‐powered expertise enables personalized treatment plans that cater to each patient's unique requirements and boost the effectiveness of treatments [5, 6]. By analyzing patient data to suggest tailored medication, AI improves treatment success and minimizes side effects [4, 5, 6]. These technologies can reduce hospital admissions and readmissions by remotely monitoring patients and alerting medical professionals to issues before they get worse [2, 3]. According to Alowais et al. (2023), AI is also greatly enhancing patient care and administrative effectiveness. Virtual health assistants driven by ML and NLP are increasingly being used to plan appointments, handle patient communications, and provide medical advice, all of which reduce the workload for medical staff [7]. Healthcare facilities operate more effectively, and resources are directed where they are most needed because to AI's capacity to manage massive information and optimize workflows [7]. By optimizing treatment plans, getting rid of unnecessary procedures, and improving diagnosis accuracy, AI has the potential to significantly reduce healthcare expenditures. Bajwa et. al. (2021) touched on one of the main factors influencing AI's adoption is its ability to lower healthcare expenses [1]. One of the primary drivers of AI adoption, according to Bajwa et al. (2021), is its potential to reduce healthcare costs [1]. Predictive analytics is a significant use of AI in healthcare that supports patient demand forecasting, population health management, and resource allocation. Since early detection and tailored treatment can prevent costly outcomes and hospital admissions, these qualities are particularly beneficial in the management of chronic illnesses [1, 3, 7].\nAI in healthcare must overcome several significant challenges if it is to live up to its full potential. Ethical concerns such as safeguarding patient privacy and avoiding bias in AI systems must be taken into consideration. There are concerns about data security and potential misuse because AI systems rely on massive amounts of data [3]. To ensure that the highest safety and efficacy standards are fulfilled and to oversee the development and use of AI technology in healthcare, robust regulatory frameworks are also necessary [8].\nAdditionally, for the healthcare industry to adopt AI, a cultural shift must occur. By automating processes like scheduling, billing, and patient triage and allocating resources optimally to cut down on wait times and enhance workflow overall, AI also increases operational competence [1, 3, 5]. Healthcare professionals must understand the benefits and drawbacks of AI technology and be ready to handle them. Collaboration between AI developers, healthcare practitioners, and legislators is essential to the development of systems that are not just technologically advanced but also aligned with the needs and values of patients and providers [7]. To enable prompt reactions, AI‐driven surveillance systems use ML algorithms to identify trends and early warning indicators of disease outbreaks [9, 58]. AI models forecast epidemics and track the spread of diseases like influenza, monkeypox, chikungunya and COVID‐19 by analyzing symptoms, travel records, and environmental data [6, 7, 8], helping public health officials allocate resources, implement prevention strategies, and tackle emergent health threats [3, 7].\nAt the outset, AI is more than just a technological advancement—it is what is propelling the advancement of healthcare. Its capacity to transform patient care, diagnostics, and operational effectiveness offers hope for a more individualized, effective, and accessible healthcare system in the future [8]. As AI develops, ethical, legal, and cultural issues must be carefully considered before integrating it into the healthcare industry. By overcoming these obstacles, AI can live up to its potential of revolutionizing healthcare into a more efficient and just system where human judgment and technological know‐how combine to provide better treatment [3, 7].\nThis review provides a comprehensive analysis of AI's implications for the healthcare sector, emphasizing how it affects operational effectiveness, treatment planning, and diagnosis. The following important sections make up the structure of the manuscript. The methodology is described in Section 2, which also includes information on the databases, keywords, inclusion/exclusion criteria, data extraction, and synthesis used in this investigation. Understanding AI in healthcare is examined in Section 3, market dynamics and the development of AI throughout time are examined in Section 4, and the use of AI in the healthcare industry is examined in Section 5. Recognizing the market dynamics, the growth of AI over time, and the critical role it has played in diagnostics, operational effectiveness, and patient care. While Section 7 concentrates on the main obstacles and worries regarding the deployment of AI in healthcare, Section 6 emphasizes the advantages of AI in the healthcare industry. Together with its disadvantages, which include ethical concerns, data privacy issues, and legal challenges, the benefits of AI, such as improved outcomes and reduced expenses have been examined. The current uses of AI in healthcare are reviewed in Section 8, and Section 9 looks at possible future developments and their ramifications. Additionally, several real‐world examples are provided, along with forecasts on future trends and implications, such as the possible impact of AI on healthcare and its continued integration.\n2.

Understanding Al in Healthcare\nAI is a disruptive force in the healthcare industry that involves novel ideas and changes in conventional methods. This section provides a thorough overview of AI in healthcare, including everything from its basic description to its current acceptance status [1, 3].\n3.1. What Is Al in Healthcare?\nThe development of computer systems capable of carrying out operations often associated with human intellect is known as AI. Within the healthcare domain, AI manifests through diverse modalities, including ML algorithms, NLP and robotics [4, 5]. These technological facets collectively empower machines to scrutinize intricate medical data, discern patterns, and render informed decisions. In effect, AI serves as a transformative augmentation of healthcare professionals’ capabilities [1, 5, 6]. AI in healthcare is a paradigm change that affects patient interaction, treatment plans, administrative procedures, and diagnosis. Improving patient outcomes, optimizing healthcare delivery, and raising the standard of care are the main objectives. AI is a flexible toolset rather than a single fix, providing a range of applications that address various facets of the healthcare environment [3, 4, 7].\n3.2. Types of Al in Healthcare\nML algorithms are essential to the healthcare industry because they make it easier to identify patterns and trends in large datasets. Another aspect of AI is NLP, which enables robots to understand and communicate with human language. This makes it easier to perform activities like voice‐activated devices or language‐based data analysis. Robots, a kind of AI, are used in healthcare through automated procedures and hands‐on support during procedures or patient care [6]. The hierarchical structure and interdependencies between AI, ML, and DL are depicted in Figure 2. As general AI concepts give way to the next generation of advanced, data‐driven learning performances, the correlations show how specificity and complexity increase from AI to DL.\nAI in healthcare comes in a variety of forms, each intended for a specific use. Rule‐based systems, for instance, make decisions based on preset criteria and are suitable for tasks like symptom screening [3, 4]. On the other hand, because ML algorithms can spot patterns in data, they are crucial for customized treatment regimens and diagnostic imaging. Applications like voice recognition and chatbots are made possible by NLP's facilitation of human‐computer communication [8]. Robotics is another area of AI that has applications in physical therapy and surgery. This demonstrates the range and complexity of AI's uses in healthcare [5].\nAI's rapid and accurate analysis of complicated medical data presents a promising path toward more accurate, data‐driven decision‐making in the healthcare industry, which will ultimately lead to better patient care and results [1, 5].\n3.3. Current State of Al Adoption in Healthcare\nAI's application in healthcare is being propelled by growing awareness of its potential benefits, data abundance, and technological advancements [3, 4]. In diagnostics, AI‐powered tools, such as X‐rays and MRIs, demonstrate remarkable accuracy in interpreting medical images, often outperforming traditional methods [6, 9]. Treatment personalization, leveraging ML algorithms, allows for tailored approaches based on individual patient profiles, optimizing therapeutic interventions [3, 10]. Administrative functions, including revenue cycle management and supply chain optimization, involve witnessing efficiency gains through AI‐driven automation [3]. Table 2 provides a crisp overview of each AI approach, including their applications, advantages, disadvantages, and references, offering a clearer understanding of their potential application and challenges in healthcare.\nTable 2.\n| AI/ML models [Ref.] | Details & application | Benefit | Drawback |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [61] | Through the creation of new chemical structures, or GANs, are essential to the development of medicinal products. They are made up of a discriminator network for assessing quality and a generator network for generating compounds, which together enable the production of many, well‐suited therapeutic candidates. |\n|\n|\n| Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) [54] | In drug discovery, RNNs are widely employed for tasks such as protein structure prediction, genomic data analysis, and peptide sequence design. RNNs are particularly good at identifying sequential relationships and creating new sequences based on patterns they have learned. |\n|\n|\n| Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) [41, 57] | CNNs are an effective tool for image‐based applications including drug target identification and chemical structure analysis. They take relevant information out of molecular pictures to help in target identification and medication design. |\n|\n|\n| Long short‐Term Memory Networks (LSTMs) [35] | Modeling and forecasting temporal relationships is a strong suit for RNN subtypes called LSTMs. They are useful for forecasting drug concentration‐time profiles, evaluating drug effectiveness, and conducting pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics research. |\n|\n|\n| Transformer Models (TMs) [43, 67] | TMs are used for NLP jobs in the pharmaceutical area, such as the popular BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model. They help researchers make well‐informed judgments on the development of new drugs by extracting important information from databases of patents, clinical trial data, and scientific literature. |\n|\n|\n| Reinforcement Learning (RL) [26] | Personalized treatment plans and optimal drug dosage methods are achieved through the application of RL approaches. By generating consecutive judgments that improve dosage optimization and patient outcomes, RL algorithms learn from interactions with the environment. |\n|\n|\n| Bayesian Models (BMs) [37, 44, 59, 71] | In drug development, BMs, such as Gaussian processes and Bayesian networks, are essential for quantifying uncertainty and making decisions. For researchers in the field, they aid in risk assessment, experimental design optimization, and probabilistic forecasts. |\n|\n|\n| Deep Q‐Networks (DQNs) [38, 49] | Drug discovery is optimized by applying DQNs, which combine RL and DL. By predicting chemical activity and suggesting promising candidates for additional testing, they improve the efficiency of the drug discovery process. |\n|\n|\n| Autoencoders (AEs) [32] | In drug development, AEs—unsupervised learning models are used for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction. They help with virtual screening and compound screening procedures by capturing important molecular features. |\n|\n|\n| Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) [55, 66] | Because they are designed to handle graph‐structured data, GNNs are perfect for drug discovery applications that involve chemical structures. They aid in de novo drug creation and virtual screening processes, efficiently model molecular graphs, and forecast features. |\n|\n|\nHowever, the current state of AI adoption is not without challenges. Although progressive businesses and important healthcare facilities welcome AI, obstacles to its broad adoption include a lack of resources, worries about data security, and the need for extensive legal frameworks [11, 12]. As technology advances, cooperation between software developers, medical practitioners, and government agencies is necessary to guarantee the appropriate and efficient application of AI [1, 5, 11]. Recognizing AI's diversity, ranging from complex ML algorithms to rule‐based systems, is essential for comprehending its application in healthcare [4, 5]. A summary of AI applications in healthcare shows how the technology has the potential to completely transform the sector, and the adoption process now reflects both advancements and challenges [3, 7]. To fully realize the promise of AI for improving healthcare delivery, we must continue to explore and collaborate as we traverse this revolutionary terrain [1, 4].\n4. Market Dynamics and the Evolution of Al Over the Years\n4.1. Global Healthcare Al Market\nHealthcare AI is estimated to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 47.6%, from $11.2 billion in 2023 to $427.5 billion by 2032. In recent years, North America has been the market leader for AI in healthcare, with over USD 6.5 billion in sales expected in 2022 [13]. AI in the healthcare market is anticipated to develop significantly in the Asia‐Pacific region, particularly in China and India, as a result of rising government backing and technical breakthroughs. Oncora, Koninklijke Philips N.V., Siemens, GE Healthcare, Medtronic, Google, Amazon, Intel, IBM, Johnson & Johnson Services Inc., and Microsoft are some of the industry leaders [13]. Figure 3 depicts the expansion of the Healthcare AI market, which is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 47.6%.\nThe market is anticipated to grow rapidly and offer substantial investment opportunities in AI‐driven healthcare technology over the next 10 years, from $11.2 billion in 2023 to $427.5 billion by 2032 [13]. The global healthcare AI market is experiencing significant growth driven by several key factors. Adoption of AI solutions has been fueled by the growing need for data‐driven healthcare practices, which allow for the analysis of large datasets and better patient outcomes [1, 3, 4]. The usage of healthcare AI, which provides tools for early identification, individualized treatment regimens, and ongoing patient monitoring, has also increased as a result of the growing burden of chronic diseases [1, 3]. Advances in ML and DL have improved the precision of therapy recommendations, predictive analytics, and diagnostic procedures [4, 5, 7].\nFurthermore, the incorporation of big data analytics facilitates improvements in clinical research, population health management, and personalized treatment. An environment that is favorable for the global spread of healthcare AI is being created by government initiatives and regulatory assistance [14, 15]. Adopting AI in healthcare is not without its challenges. Patients and healthcare professionals are concerned about using sensitive health data; therefore, data security and privacy issues continue to be major obstacles [12, 16]. The lack of established data formats creates interoperability issues that make it difficult to integrate AI solutions into current healthcare systems [11]. Uncertainty among stakeholders is exacerbated by the lack of legislation and standards pertaining specifically to healthcare AI, and certain healthcare providers may find it financially difficult to bear the high implementation costs associated with infrastructure, training, and integration. Another obstacle to the broad use of AI‐driven technology is the reluctance of healthcare practitioners to adapt. To overcome these obstacles, cooperation is needed to create strong legal frameworks, resolve privacy issues, and encourage the ethical and efficient use of AI in international healthcare contexts [12, 15].\n4.2. Evolution of Al Over the Years\nOver many decades, AI has experienced major advancements in theory and practice. Figure 4 illustrates the development of AI by highlighting key milestones and significant achievements, from early theoretical foundations to contemporary advancements, including foundational algorithms, research breakthroughs, and recent innovations. There is a rapid increase in the number of significant turning points in the development of AI [6, 17, 60, 65]:\n-\ni.\nFoundational Concepts (1950s): The term “artificial intelligence” was first coined by the computer scientist John McCarthy in 1955. In 1950, Alan Turing introduced the Turing test as a measure of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human.\n-\nii.\nDartmouth Conference (1956): The Dartmouth Conference in 1956, which is regarded as the beginning of the area of AI, brought together early AI pioneers, including McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester, and Claude Shannon.\n-\niii.\nSymbolic AI and Expert Systems (1960s‐1970s): Rule‐based methods and symbolic thinking were the main features of early AI systems. Expert system development, which employs knowledge‐based rules to address certain issues, has become increasingly common.\n-\niv.\nML and Neural Networks (1980s‐1990s): The focus shifted to ML, with algorithms capable of learning from data. Neural networks, inspired by the structure of the human brain, have gained increased amounts of attention. However, progress has been limited due to computational constraints and a lack of sufficient data.\n-\nv.\nAI Winter (1980s‐1990s): Funding for AI research declined due to overpromised results and unmet expectations. This period became known as the “AI winter”.\n-\nvi.\nRise of ML and Data (2000s‐2010s): Advances in ML, fueled by increased computing power and the availability of large datasets, led to breakthroughs in areas such as NLP and computer vision. Support vector machines, decision trees, and ensemble methods have become popular in ML.\n-\nvii.\nDL Revolution (2010s‐2020s): DL, especially using neural networks with many layers (deep neural networks), became a dominant paradigm. Key breakthroughs, such as the ImageNet competition in 2012, demonstrated the effectiveness of DL in image recognition. DL algorithms have played a crucial role in advancements in speech recognition, language translation, and other AI applications.\n-\nviii.\nAI in Everyday Life (Present): AI is being incorporated into many areas of daily life, such as recommendation engines, driverless cars, and virtual assistants. The subject is still being shaped by ongoing advancements in explainable AI, generative models, and RL.\nWith the increasing deployment of AI, there is a growing focus on ethical considerations, bias in AI systems, and the impact of AI on employment and society. The journey of AI is marked by periods of optimism, disappointment, and resurgence, with ongoing challenges and opportunities shaping its trajectory. The field continues to evolve as researchers explore new algorithms, models, and applications [3, 18].\n5. Applications of Al in Healthcare\nAI has revolutionized the way medical professionals approach diagnosis, treatment planning, and operating procedures [1, 7]. In addition, a new era of innovation in healthcare has emerged recently. AI is rapidly emerging as a key component of the healthcare industry due to its many uses, which significantly enhance many facets of the sector [3, 9]. Healthcare delivery is changing as a result of the shift from diagnostic and individualized care to administrative procedures, ethical issues, patient involvement, and AI‐powered remote monitoring [1, 3]. AI has many different and extensive uses in healthcare. AI is influencing how healthcare is delivered in the future, from improving administrative procedures and guaranteeing ethical concerns to revolutionizing diagnostics and treatment customization. To fully utilize AI while preserving moral principles and patient welfare, continued cooperation between technologists, medical practitioners, and legislators will be crucial as its integration progresses [3, 7, 15].\n5.1. Diagnostics and Disease Identification\nThe integration of AI into diagnostic and disease identification has revolutionized healthcare, particularly in medical imaging, where AI algorithms exhibit unparalleled proficiency. A significant benefit in time‐sensitive scenarios is the quick and accurate interpretation of complicated pictures, including those from MRIs and X‐rays, which speeds up the diagnostic process [6, 9]. This procedure not only speeds up the start of treatment but also improves accuracy, helping medical practitioners identify minute irregularities that would be missed by conventional techniques [6]. AI is also a useful tool for radiography image analysis and tissue sample analysis [9]. Pathology and AI's examination of microscopic details help pathologists quickly and precisely identify problems. The cooperative concept of AI algorithms and radiologists in radiology improves patient care, solves staffing shortages, and speeds up and improves diagnosis [9]. Beyond productivity improvements, AI has a significant impact on patient outcomes in diagnostics. Quick and precise diagnoses allow for prompt interventions, which are essential when prognosis is greatly impacted by early diagnosis [5]. Furthermore, AI's use as a screening tool supports preventative care initiatives by assisting in the early detection of illnesses [5]. Research has shown that AI may perform on par with or better than human experts in several areas when it comes to identifying medical conditions from photos [1, 5]. For instance, when it came to detecting pneumonia, a CNN trained on annotated frontal chest X‐ray pictures performed better than radiology professionals. In a similar vein, a dermatology CNN trained on clinical pictures was successful in correctly classifying skin lesions [1]. AI algorithms trained on whole‐slide pathology images may identify lymph node metastases of breast cancer with an accuracy comparable to that of pathologists in the pathology domain [1, 19]. Additionally, in the field of cardiology, a DL system demonstrated performance comparable to that of cardiologists in identifying heart attacks [1, 19]. Responsible deployment requires tackling algorithmic bias, protecting patient privacy, and defining precise rules for AI and medical professionals to work together. A possible model for guaranteeing better patient care and influencing the direction of healthcare diagnostics in the future is the cooperative synergy between AI and human expertise [15, 19, 39, 69].\n5.2. Treatment Personalization\nWith a major contribution to medication discovery and development as well as the treatment landscape, AI's disruptive impact in healthcare is especially noticeable in therapy personalization [3].\n5.2.1. Drug Discovery and Development\nThe application of AI to medication research and discovery marks a significant advancement for the pharmaceutical sector. AI has become a vital collaborator in the field of drug research, helping to identify possible therapeutic candidates [11, 20, 47]. Large datasets are painstakingly analyzed by ML algorithms, which also forecast the effectiveness of different substances and expedite the preliminary phases of drug screening [10]. This method greatly cuts down on the time and expenses often involved in introducing a novel medication to the market, in addition to speeding up the identification process [11, 51]. Furthermore, by enabling more effective clinical trials, anticipating possible adverse effects, and identifying patient groups who would react best to particular treatments, AI helps to optimize drug development [3, 10, 57]. The conversion of scientific discoveries into practical treatment options is accelerated by AI's capacity to handle complicated biological data [10, 21, 39]. Drug development has undergone a paradigm shift as a result of this revolutionary use of AI, shifting from a labor‐intensive and time‐consuming process to one i.e. more efficient and data‐driven [3, 22, 62]. As AI algorithms continue to evolve and learn from diverse datasets, the potential for discovering novel therapies, improving treatment efficacy, and tailoring interventions to individual patient profiles has become gradually promising, steering in a new era of innovation in the pharmaceutical landscape [5, 10].\n5.2.2. Revolutionizing Personalized Healthcare\nOne of the most transformative applications of AI in healthcare lies in treatment planning, and personalization can be performed a step further by leveraging AI to tailor interventions based on individual patient profiles [3, 7].

A medical diagnosis is the identification of the disease or conditions that cause a person’s symptoms and signs. Usually, the patient’s medical history and physical examination provide diagnostic information. Diagnosing a medical condition can be difficult because many symptoms are ambiguous and can only be correctly identified by trained healthcare professionals. This can be a major problem in developing countries where doctors and other health professionals are scarce. Many people in these countries cannot get proper medical diagnosis and treatment for lack of healthcare professionals [2]. AI could be helpful for undeveloped regions [3]. The AI-based system [4, 5] is able to detect various diseases, such as kidney stone detection [6], heart disease prediction and detection [7], skin and lung cancer detection [8, 9], diabetes prediction and detection [10]. Recently, AI-based systems have played an important role in the correct diagnosis of COVID-19 [11, 12].\nA branch of artificial intelligence called “ML” focuses on creating algorithms that allow computers to learn from data and make predictions. It is based on the idea that systems can automatically get better at a task over time by gaining experience and processing lots of data. Recent advances in ML technology have enabled computers to process and understand information on a par with humans. In some cases, these systems can recognize patterns and extract information with greater accuracy than trained experts. This is a significant step forward, as it demonstrates the ability of machines to process and understand complex information in new and novel ways. ML has become a powerful tool due to improvements in classical statistical modeling techniques, large amounts of data, growth in computing power, and advanced algorithm design [13]. ML algorithms can be trained on large datasets of medical images such as radiographs and MRI scans [14], to identify signs of disease or abnormalities. There are two types of problems in ML, classification and regression. Classification is predicting an outcome from a set of data, while regression is showing the relationship between dependent and independent variables.\nWhile ML algorithms have been proven to be valuable tools in medical diagnosis [15, 16], it is essential to recognize that they should not replace human expertise and judgment. ML algorithms rely on the data they have been trained on and may not consider all relevant factors in the diagnostic process. Additionally, these algorithms are not infallible and can make errors. Therefore, it is crucial for healthcare professionals to exercise caution, review, and verify the results generated by ML systems to ensure accurate and reliable diagnoses. The integration of ML into healthcare can be considered as a collaborative approach that combines the strengths of both algorithms and human expertise to achieve the best possible outcomes for patients.\n1.1 Motivation\nThe main purpose of this thorough review is to provide a helpful guide for upcoming researchers, especially those who want to explore the unused possibilities of using ML for detecting diseases at an early stage.

Section 6 presents research challenges and future perspectives. Section 6 discusses the conclusions of this review.\n2 Background\n2.1 Types of ML\nDiverse categories of ML models exist, encompassing supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning approaches.\nSupervised Learning\nIn this approach, the model is trained on labeled data and makes predictions based on that data. The objective is to establish a mapping function between input and output variables. Supervised learning is commonly used for tasks like image classification, where the model learns from labeled examples to classify new images accurately.\nUnsupervised Learning\nThis category of learning entails training the model using unlabeled data, allowing it to uncover concealed patterns and structures autonomously, devoid of human intervention. Unsupervised learning excels at tasks such as image recognition and clustering, where the model identifies similarities and differences within the data without any prior knowledge of the classes or labels.\nSemi-Supervised Learning\nIn this context, the model undergoes training through a blend of both labeled and unlabeled data sources. The labeled data is used to make predictions, while the unlabeled data aids in enhancing the model’s accuracy and performance. The objective is to harness the wealth of unlabeled data in order to enhance the model’s overall performance, particularly in situations where acquiring labeled data proves expensive or time-intensive.\nReinforcement Learning\nIn the realm of reinforcement learning, an agent acquires knowledge through iterative trial and error engagements with its surroundings. By taking actions and receiving subsequent rewards or penalties contingent on its actions, the agent adapts its decision-making approach to optimize the cumulative reward signal. Reinforcement learning finds applications in various domains, such as robotics, gaming AI, and recommendation systems.\nFigure 1 illustrates the different methods of ML algorithms, depicting the relationships and distinctions among supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning approaches.\n2.1.1 Support Vector Machine (SVM)\nSVM is a ML algorithm used for classification tasks. SVM was introduced in the 20th century by Vanpik [17]. The primary objective of SVM is to identify an optimal hyperplane that effectively divides the gathered data into distinct classes. The space between this hyperplane and the nearest data points from each class is referred to as the support vector. The selection of the hyperplane aims to maximize the margin, denoting the gap between the vector and the hyperplane itself. SVM handles nonlinearly separable data. It transforms the data into a high-dimensional space where linear boundaries can be found.\n2.1.2 Decision Tree (DT)\nA DT is a supervised learning model employed to address both classification and regression tasks. DT follows the divide-and-conquer strategy [18]. DT works by dividing the source data into subsets based on the most significant attributes. This splitting is done in a recursive manner, hence it is called recursive partitioning. Each internal node is characterized as a dataset, with branches representing the decision made and leaves representing the final result or prediction. Decision Trees are popular for modeling and visualizing complex decision-making processes because they are easily interpretable and can handle both categorical and numerical data.\n2.1.3 Naïve Bayes\nNaïve Bayes [19] is a probabilistic ML algorithm that is based on the Bayes theorem. This theorem states that which states that the probability of a hypothesis (e.g., a class label in classification) given observed evidence (e.g., features of an instance) is proportional to the prior probability of the hypothesis and the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.\nThe NB algorithm is used to predict the class label of an instance based on its feature. This model makes a strong assumption of independence between features, which is why it is called naive. This independence assumption doesn’t hold in reality. This algorithm works well when there is high dimensionality and a large amount of data to classify.\n2.1.4 AdaBoost\nAdaBoost, short for Adaptive Boosting, stands as a widely recognized ensemble learning algorithm in ML. It orchestrates the amalgamation of multiple weak models, culminating in the construction of a robust model that contributes to precise predictions. This algorithm gives more weight to the samples that are harder to classify so that the model focuses more on those samples. This process is repeated several times and the weights are updated at each iteration until a satisfactory model is obtained. The final model is a weighted average of the individual weak models [20].\n2.1.5 K-nearest neighbor\nKNN is an ML classification algorithm that assigns a label to a data point based on the majority vote of the K nearest neighbors used for prediction. The algorithm identifies K data points within the training set that exhibit the closest proximity to the new data point. Subsequently, it leverages the class labels of these K neighbors to formulate a prediction. This prediction is determined through a majority vote among the classes of these K neighbors. It is important to choose an appropriate value of K because K has a significant impact on the performance of the algorithm [21].\n2.1.6 Logistic Regression\nLogistic Regression (LR) serves as a statistical model within ML, elucidating the association between a continuous dependent variable and independent variables. The independent variables, often referred to as predictors or features, play the role of prognosticators in anticipating the outcome. LR is used for 2-class classification. It first calculates the linear combination between the independent variables and the coefficient, known as the logit. It then predicts the outcome by transforming the output through a logistic/sigmoid function [22].\n2.2 Deep Learning Overview\nDeep learning (DL) represents a remarkable branch of AI and ML that has garnered significant attention due to its ability to mimic the structure and function of the human brain [23]. It has been demonstrated extraordinary potential in various applications, particularly in fields such as medical disease prediction, computer vision, and decision-making. DL algorithms, built on the concept of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), have proven to be highly effective at learning complex relationships within data and making accurate predictions. The foundation of DL lies in neural networks, which consist of interconnected processing nodes arranged in layers. Each node, or neuron, processes input data and passes the result to subsequent layers, eventually leading to the generation of an output. These networks excel at learning intricate patterns from raw data, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering, a process that traditionally required domain expertise and considerable effort [24]. The process of training DL networks is central to their success. It involves presenting the network with vast amounts of labeled data and adjusting its internal parameters, namely the weights and biases, to minimize prediction errors. This optimization process is typically achieved through gradient descent and backpropagation algorithms, which iteratively fine-tune the model’s parameters until it becomes capable of accurate predictions.\nOne of the most significant breakthroughs facilitated by DL is in the field of medical diagnosis, particularly in medical image processing. By leveraging DL models, researchers and healthcare professionals have made significant strides in diagnosing various medical conditions using different medical imaging modalities, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and chest radiographs [25,26,27,28]. These models have showcased unprecedented accuracy, often outperforming human experts. Despite these accomplishments, DL models in medical diagnosis are still in their early stages and have their limitations. While they excel at accuracy, their interpretability remains a challenge. Understanding the decision-making process of complex neural networks can be elusive, leading to concerns about the transparency and trustworthiness of their results. As such, extensive testing and validation are necessary before these models can be widely integrated into clinical practice. It is essential to interpret their outputs in conjunction with a patient’s medical history and other diagnostic information to ensure precise and reliable diagnoses.\nAs illustrated in Fig. 2, the development of ML and DL has evolved over time, with DL emerging as a powerful extension of ML. The timeline depicts the progress made in both fields, showcasing how DL has transformed various domains and opened up new possibilities for researchers, developers, and practitioners alike. In conclusion, DL stands as a revolutionary advancement in AI and ML. Through its utilization of neural networks and the ability to automatically extract complex patterns from data, DL has enabled breakthroughs in numerous AI applications. In the medical field, DL has shown promise in diagnosing diseases through medical image processing, revolutionizing healthcare practices. However, challenges related to model interpretability and rigorous validation remain critical areas of focus. As researchers continue to explore and refine DL techniques, its impact on AI and diverse industries will undoubtedly continue to be profound, fueling innovation and driving future advancements.\n2.2.1 Convolutional Neural Networks\nCNNs represent a category of powerful DL models, mainly employed for tasks in computer vision. Their applications encompass a wide range of tasks, including image classification and segmentation [29]. They are specifically designed to process visual data efficiently by exploiting the spatial correlations present in images [30]. A typical CNN consists of multiple layers. The first layer is the input layer, which takes the raw image data as input. Then, a series of convolutional layers follow. In each convolutional layer, the model utilizes a collection of tunable filters, also referred to as kernels, to process the input image, producing feature maps that highlight different patterns or features [31]. Pooling layers are frequently interspersed between convolutional layers to perform downsampling on the feature maps, effectively reducing their spatial dimensions while preserving critical information. This downsampling process not only alleviates the computational load but also enhances the network’s resilience to input variations, making it more robust in handling diverse visual patterns [32]. The outcomes obtained from these layers are commonly flattened and then fed into one or multiple fully connected layers. These fully connected layers process the high-level features and make the final predictions, depending on the specific task.\nTo introduce non-linearity, activation functions are applied after each layer’s output. The widely adopted activation function in CNNs is the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) due to its straightforwardness and its ability to address the vanishing gradient issue effectively. By setting all negative values to zero, ReLU allows the network to efficiently learn intricate representations [33, 34].\nCNNs are typically trained using various loss functions, depending on the task. For image classification, the softmax function combined with the categorical cross-entropy loss is commonly used to measure the dissimilarity between predicted and true class probabilities.\nIn the domain of regression tasks, it is commonplace to utilize loss functions such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE) [35]. Training CNNs involves forward and backward passes through the network using an optimization algorithm like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or its variants. The goal is to minimize the chosen loss function and update the network’s parameters to improve its performance on the task.\nIn summary, CNNs are a powerful class of DL models for computer vision tasks. They consist of convolutional layers to extract relevant features, pooling layers for downsampling, fully connected layers for decision-making, and ReLU activations to introduce non-linearity. The choice of loss functions depends on the specific task, and CNNs are trained to minimize these losses through optimization algorithms. Overall, CNNs have revolutionized the field of computer vision and continue to play a vital role in various real-world applications [36]. Figure 3 illustrate the basic CNN architecture.\n2.2.2 Transfer Learning\nTransfer learning constitutes a ML approach wherein insights gained from training a model on a particular task or domain are harnessed to elevate performance on a separate yet interconnected task or domain [37]. Transfer learning offers a significant advantage by reducing the necessity for a large amount of labeled data to achieve satisfactory performance on the target task [38, 39]. Pre-training on a large and diverse dataset allows the model to learn general features that are transferable to a wide range of tasks. As a result, when the model is fine-tuned on the target task with a smaller dataset, it can adapt its learned representations to the specific nuances of the new data, leading to improved performance. Transfer learning also enables the application of DL to tasks with limited data availability. Training deep neural networks from scratch typically requires a large dataset to prevent overfitting, but in many real-world scenarios, collecting such vast amounts of data might be challenging or expensive. By utilizing pre-trained models, which have already learned useful features, transfer learning allows us to tackle tasks with limited labeled data effectively.\nAnother advantage of transfer learning is that it can help mitigate the problem of vanishing gradients. Deep neural networks often have numerous layers, and during training, gradients can become very small, making it difficult for the model to learn effectively. Pre-training on a related task helps in initializing the model’s weights in a way that provides a better starting point for the optimization process during fine-tuning, making training more stable and efficient. Furthermore, transfer learning allows the application of knowledge learned from one domain to another, leading to better generalization. For example, features learned from natural image datasets can be transferred to medical imaging tasks or satellite imagery analysis, even though the source and target domains are quite different. This transfer of knowledge helps in building more robust and versatile models that perform well in various scenarios [40, 41]. Its advantages include the reduction of data requirements, the ability to handle limited labeled data, better initialization for training, and improved generalization across different domains, making it a crucial tool for advancing artificial intelligence applications.\n2.2.3 Emerging Trends in CNNs\nPre-trained models have emerged as a game-changer in the field of AI, especially for computer vision tasks. The idea behind these models is to pre-train a neural network on a large and diverse dataset, such as ImageNet, which contains millions of images belonging to thousands of different categories. During pre-training, the model learns to extract and encode meaningful features from the data, effectively capturing a general understanding of visual patterns and structures. The advantages of pre-training are manifold. Firstly, it significantly reduces the need for massive labeled datasets when tackling new tasks. Moreover, pre-trained models act as knowledge repositories that encapsulate valuable information about the low-level and high-level features found in the training data. As a result, they offer a head start for new tasks, especially in domains where gathering labeled data can be expensive, time-consuming, or simply impractical. Additionally, pre-trained models foster better generalization. The features learned during pre-training tend to be more robust and transferable across different datasets and domains. This transfer of knowledge leads to models that exhibit improved performance, particularly when the target task’s dataset is small or dissimilar from the original training data.\nThese pre-trained architectures, such as AlexNet, VGG, InceptionV3, ResNet, DenseNet, InceptionResNetV2, Xception, and MobileNet, have become standard tools in the DL toolkit. Researchers and practitioners commonly use them as the starting point for their specific computer vision projects, saving substantial computational resources and time that would otherwise be spent on training from scratch.\n-\nAlexNet: Introduced in 2012 [38], AlexNet is one of the pioneering deep CNN. It plays a significant role in popularizing DL for computer vision tasks. AlexNet is characterized by its architecture, which comprises five convolutional layers, all using ReLU activations. This arrangement results in a deeper network compared to earlier architectures, contributing to its ability to learn more intricate features and patterns from input data.\n-\nVGG (Visual Geometry Group): VGG [42] is a deep architecture proposed by the Visual Geometry Group. It is known for its simplicity and uniformity, consisting of multiple layers with small 3 × 3 convolutional filters and max-pooling layers. VGG variants with different depths, such as VGG16 and VGG19, are widely used.\n-\nInceptionV3: Also known as GoogLeNet, InceptionV3 [43] was introduced by Google researchers. It features the Inception module, which uses multiple filter sizes within the same layer to capture different-scale features. This architecture is efficient and has excellent performance on various tasks.\n-\nResNet (Residual Network): ResNet [44] is famous for introducing residual connections, which allow the model to skip some layers during training. This innovation addresses the vanishing gradient problem and made it possible to train much deeper networks. ResNet50 and ResNet101 are common variants.\n-\nDenseNet: DenseNet [45] is designed to maximize feature reuse by connecting each layer to every subsequent layer in a feed-forward fashion. This densely connected architecture fosters better gradient flow, reduces the network complexity, and encourages feature propagation throughout the network.\n-\nInceptionResNetV2: Combining ideas from both Inception and ResNet, InceptionResNetV2 [46] achieves strong performance while being computationally efficient. It incorporates residual connections and inception modules, offering a potent combination of features.\n-\nXception (Extreme Inception): Xception represents a development of the Inception architecture and introduces depthwise separable convolutions [47]. These separable convolutions in Xception are designed to dramatically decrease the computational cost while still preserving high accuracy in the model’s predictions.\n-\nMobileNet: MobileNet is designed for mobile and embedded vision applications, emphasizing efficiency and small model size [48, 49]. It employs separable convolutions to reduce the computation complexity, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments.\nIn summary, pre-trained models have revolutionized the landscape of DL, specifically in the realm of computer vision. Their ability to transfer knowledge from extensive pre-training to new tasks with limited data has made them indispensable tools for building high-performing and resource-efficient models in various real-world applications. As DL continues to advance, pre-trained models will undoubtedly remain a crucial component in accelerating progress and making cutting-edge AI accessible to a broader audience.\n2.3 Model Evaluation Metrics\nIn this section, we explain the performance metrics of the models. Model evaluation metrics are mathematical functions used to evaluate the performance of ML models. Accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and f1 score are the most commonly used evaluation metrics. The accuracy rate is the ratio between the correctly identified samples and the total samples. Precision is defined as the ratio of true positive predictions to all positive samples. The sensitivity is used to predict the actual positive samples for each available sample. The F1 score is used to evaluate the ability of the model by combining precision and recall. FP false positives, TN true negatives, FN false negatives, and TP true positives were used to calculate the performance metrics of the model. All metrics can be calculated as follows:\n3 Bibliometric Analysis\nThe Web of science and Scopus databases were used to collect references for statistical analysis. We studied the published papers using subject area, year and journal.\n3.1 Subject Area\nWhile ML has gained significant traction in healthcare applications, there are still several areas of ML-based research that require further exploration. Figure 4 provides an overview of the ML algorithms utilized across various fields. Interestingly, the dominant fields that heavily emphasize ML methods are computer science (40%) and engineering (31.2%). This indicates the widespread adoption and focus on ML techniques in these disciplines, showcasing the potential for interdisciplinary collaboration and knowledge transfer to further advance ML-based research in healthcare and other domains.\n3.2 Publications by Year\nFigure 5 provides an insightful representation of the exponential growth in published papers utilizing ML methods for disease diagnosis since 2014. The data collection process involved searching through web of science and Scopus databases using keywords such as “ML in medical applications” and “ML-based disease diagnosis.” The graph effectively demonstrates the increasing interest and research activity in this field, highlighting the expanding body of knowledge and the significance of ML in medical research.\n3.3 Publications by Journals\nThe data collection process involved gathering papers from the most popular and reputable journals published over the span of the past eight years. The analysis revealed that PLOS ONE, Nature Scientific Reports, and IEEE Access emerged as the most productive journals in terms of the number of papers published on ML-based disease diagnosis.

The graph provides a quantitative comparison, allowing researchers to identify the leading journals in the field and gauge the level of activity and interest within each publication. The prominence of Expert systems with applications, multimedia tools and applications, PLOS ONE, Nature Scientific Reports, Artificial intelligence in medicine and IEEE Access can be attributed to several factors, including their wide readership, interdisciplinary focus, and commitment to open access publishing. These journals likely attract a diverse range of researchers from different domains, contributing to the growing body of literature on ML applications in disease diagnosis. The significance of this finding lies in the recognition of these key journals as valuable resources for researchers interested in ML-based disease diagnosis. Researchers can target these journals for publication, ensuring their work reaches a broad audience and contributes to the collective knowledge in the field. Overall, Fig. 5 serves as a valuable visual representation of the publication trends in ML-based disease diagnosis, shedding light on the leading journals that have contributed to the dissemination of research findings in this rapidly evolving domain.\n4 Exploring the Potential of ML in Healthcare Diagnostics\n4.1 Cancer\nIslam et al.

Alamin et al. [56] introduced an ensemble model designed to effectively detect lung and colon cancers. The model underwent evaluation using the histopathological (LC25000) lung and colon dataset, yielding impressive accuracy rates: 99.05% for lung cancer, 100% for colon cancer, and 99.30% for both lung and colon cancers. Notably, the proposed model outperformed existing models, signifying its potential application in clinical settings for accurate cancer diagnosis. Bansal et al. [57] presented a DL model based on VGG19 and also used other feature extraction methods (SIFT, SURF, ORB, Shi-Tomasi). The extracted feature were classified using different ML algorithms, and the results showed that RF with collaborative features had an accuracy of 93.73%, outperforming other classifiers. The findings suggest that a single feature extractor is insufficient and that a mixed method using both DL features and classical handmade features is preferable for picture classification.

Case studies on various disease types further validate its exceptional capacity to predict illness-associated miRNA-disease relationships, making it a valuable tool in computational biology. The study [66] introduces a DL architecture for predicting 72-hour ED bounce-backs using structured and unstructured EHR data, aiding emergency care by early identification of high-risk patients. Integrating structured vitals and demographics data with unstructured physician notes enhances prediction accuracy. Focusing on ED readmissions within 72 h fills a research gap in the literature. In [67], a novel supervised feature selection technique based on manifold learning is proposed, aiming to maximize same-class sample proximity within the selected subset. It effectively reduces computational complexity in microarray datasets while improving diagnostic accuracy. Comparative evaluation against ten existing algorithms on seven microarray datasets confirms its superior performance, establishing its promise as an effective feature selection approach for microarray data analysis.

The evaluation of the models was conducted using publicly accessible chest X-ray images, revealing that the most favorable outcomes were achieved by the ResNet-34 model, achieving an impressive accuracy of 98.33%. Wang and Wong [164] introduced a CNN model named COVID-Net, designed for the detection of COVID-19. The achieved testing accuracy of the model was notably high at 92.6%. In this study [165], chest X-ray scans captured in the Posterior-Anterior (PA) view were subjected to analysis using DL-based models. This investigation encompassed both COVID-19 positive and healthy patients. The dataset underwent preprocessing and augmentation, followed by a comparative assessment of three distinct models in terms of accuracy. Remarkably, the Xception model demonstrated the most superior performance, achieving an impressive accuracy of 97.97% in detecting chest X-ray images. In [166], the author introduced the LW-CORONet model, meticulously engineered to extract meaningful features from chest X-ray (CXR) images. A rigorous evaluation was conducted utilizing two extensive CXR datasets, yielding classification accuracies of 98.67% and 99.00% for multi-class scenarios, and 95.67% and 96.25% for binary classification cases, respectively. Comparative analysis was undertaken against four pre-trained CNN models and state-of-the-art counterparts. Importantly, the LW-CORONet model demonstrates a pronounced advantage by demanding fewer parameters and consuming less memory space compared to alternative models. The D3SENet [167] is a novel hybrid deep feature extraction network proposed to extract the most important features from chest x-ray images. A large and balanced dataset was used to classify Covid-19 infected, viral pneumonia infected and healthy individuals. The proposed method had an impressive result, achieving an accuracy of 98.48% on a three-class classification task. Weihan et al. [168] performed experiments on a dataset of 5143 X-ray images of three different classes (Healthy, Covid-19, and Pneumonia) using both SVM and CNN. Using handcrafted features such as Texture, GLCM, GLDM, FFT, Wavelet Transform and LBP, an SVM classifier was able to achieve an accuracy of 96.3%. When using an end-to-end CNN model, an accuracy of 98.3% was reached. The paper [169] provides a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, encompassing structural features, antigen design methods, and scalability. It discusses challenges and future prospects for preventive mRNA vaccines against infectious diseases, aiming to enhance understanding and their potential in epidemic control and public health protection. In [170], emphasizes the need for long-term follow-up studies to examine respiratory symptoms and lung damage in COVID-19 survivors. It underscores the significance of post-acute COVID-19 syndrome as a potential concern for healthcare providers, necessitating comprehensive management of chronic complications in the growing population of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals globally. In [171], the investigation focuses on assessing the effectiveness of a COVID-19 booster dose vaccination in countering the Omicron variant. The study aims to clarify the ongoing debate on the importance of booster doses and their protective duration against the Omicron variant. Utilizing PubMed (Medline) for systematic search, the paper presents findings from various studies, indicating that a booster dose can increase neutralization titers against the Omicron variant and lower the risk of symptomatic breakthrough infections. In the study [172], non-invasive medical imaging is proposed to overcome RT-PCR limitations in COVID-19 diagnosis. Deep TL-based CNN approaches are evaluated to effectively analyze chest CT images, achieving improved COVID-19 screening with custom pre-trained models using batch normalization and regularization to address overfitting and enhance detection accuracy. The proposed DQ-NNPP method [173] combines two techniques with Privacy Preservation, offering improved data transmission security with reduced encryption and decryption time. By integrating cryptographic and biometric systems with DL techniques, it achieves authentication, anomaly detection, and enhanced medical system security. Comparative analysis with standard approaches, such as SAB-UAS, MSCryptoNet, and PPDP, demonstrates its effectiveness. This paper introduces a novel ensemble method [174] for the detection of COVID-19 infection from lung CT scan images. The method involves fine-tuning multiple deep neural networks. By integrating the trained models, a robust ensemble classifier is constructed, outperforming existing methods and achieving superior outcomes. In [175], the proposed method is an ensemble approach, ET-NET, for rapid COVID-19 screening using three TL models to enhance supervised image classification performance. ET-NET combines base classifiers based on confidence scores, reducing prediction errors’ variability and achieving superior results compared to the current technique on the same dataset by 1.56% through 5-fold cross-validation. The research [176] evaluates TL-based ResNet models for COVID-19 Pneumonia detection in Chest X-ray images, emphasizing the importance of CT/CXR in identifying COVID-19 infection. The study shows performance improvements in diverse target domains, attributing the success of TL. ResNet32, with a top-2 smooth loss function and cost-sensitive features, is employed as their DTL model to handle noisy and unbalanced data. Introduces [177] a novel weights-only transfer learning (TL) technique for automatic COVID-19 infection detection in CT-scan images on point-of-care devices. This approach prunes less important filters from convolutional layers, reducing pre-trained model weight parameters. Evaluation with the SARS-CoV-2 dataset confirms its effectiveness in reducing runtime resource requirements, making it suitable for point-of-care device implementation. In [178], The author suggests a transfer learning (TL) technique involving the fine-tuning of the ResNet50 model to classify COVID-19 patients. Ten pre-trained weights from diverse datasets are used, employing supervised and self-supervised learning. The COVID-19 Radiography Database is used for training and testing, with data transformation applied and the dataset split into train and test sets. The best-performing model among various fine-tuned ResNet50 TL models is identified, achieving binary classification for Covid and Normal categories. Table 8 Explore the latest developments in COVID-19 diagnosis and detection using DL techniques, highlighting the advantages and contributions of each method towards accurate and efficient screening.\n5 Publicly Available Datasets\nData is the backbone of ML and DL models, and its availability is critical for training effective and accurate algorithms. Here’s how data is useful in ML and DL:\n-\nModel Training: Data is used to train ML and DL models to learn patterns and relationships between input features and target outputs. The more diverse and representative the data, the better the model can generalize to new, unseen examples.\n-\nFeature Learning: In DL, large amounts of data help in learning hierarchical representations of features. These learned features capture meaningful patterns and enable the model to understand complex relationships between different data elements.\n-\nGeneralization: Adequate data helps models generalize well to unseen examples. When trained on diverse data, ML and DL models can better handle variations and uncertainties present in real-world data, making them more robust and accurate.\n-\nTransfer Learning: Pre-trained models, trained on large datasets, act as a starting point for transfer learning. They provide learned representations that can be fine-tuned on specific tasks, allowing for quicker convergence and improved performance with limited data.\n-\nAvoiding Overfitting: Sufficient data helps in preventing overfitting, where the model becomes too specific to the training data and fails to generalize to new data. Adequate data helps regularize the model and make it more generalizable.\n-\nData Augmentation: When dealing with restricted data availability, data augmentation techniques prove valuable by artificially expanding the dataset through transformations such as rotations, flips, and color adjustments. This augmented dataset contributes to bolstering the model’s resilience.\n-\nData Bias and Fairness: Datasets with sufficient diversity can help in mitigating bias in ML and DL models. By including representative samples from various demographics, the model can be trained to make fair and unbiased predictions.\n-\nHandling Noisy Data: ML and DL models can learn to handle noisy data by exposing them to a wide range of examples. This exposure helps the model identify patterns even in the presence of noise.\n-\nUnsupervised Learning: In unsupervised learning, data is crucial for clustering and discovering underlying structures and patterns within the data without labeled outputs.\n-\nReal-World Applications: Ultimately, data is essential because ML and DL are practical tools that aim to solve real-world problems. The availability of relevant and diverse data ensures that the models are capable of delivering valuable insights and predictions in various domains, ranging from healthcare and finance to image and speech recognition.\nTable 9 compiles a collection of publicly available datasets and their respective sources, serving as valuable resources for upcoming researchers and practitioners in the field.

ML algorithms are widely used for the diagnosis of different diseases, however, researchers still face several challenges. In this section, the research challenges and future prospects of ML in medical applications have been discussed.\n6.1 Challenges Related to Data Availability\n-\n1.\nInsufficient Labeled Data: ML models rely on large amounts of labeled data for training and evaluation. However, in the context of medical diagnosis, obtaining labeled data can be challenging and time-consuming. This scarcity of labeled data hinders the model’s ability to generalize well and may lead to poor performance and excessive drift.\n-\n2.\nMalicious Attacks: ML models are vulnerable to malicious attacks where false data is intentionally fed to the model to deceive it into making incorrect predictions. These attacks can compromise the integrity and reliability of the model’s outputs, posing significant risks in medical diagnosis and treatment decision-making.\n-\n3.\nNoisy Data: Noisy data, which contains errors, outliers, or corrupted information, can have a detrimental effect on the performance of ML models. The presence of noisy data can introduce biases, distort patterns, and increase the learning time of the model, ultimately affecting its accuracy and robustness in medical diagnosis tasks.\n6.2 Challenges Related to ML Algorithms for Disease Diagnosis\n-\n1.\nDisease Misdiagnosis: Some diseases may exhibit similar visual appearances or symptoms, leading to misdiagnosis when relying solely on ML algorithms. For instance, diseases like COVID-19 and pneumonia share certain visual similarities, which can cause the algorithm to classify all test images into a single class, compromising the accuracy of the diagnosis.\n-\n2.\nLack of Interpretability: The black-box nature of certain ML models poses challenges in terms of interpreting the model’s predictions. The inability to understand and explain the decision-making process of the model hinders its clinical utility and reduces the trust and confidence clinicians may have in the predictions.\n-\n3.\nTest Set Misclassification: ML models may encounter challenges in accurately classifying patients in the test set, leading to misclassifications with potentially severe consequences. For example, if a patient is actually infected with COVID-19, but the model misclassifies them as having pneumonia, it can result in inappropriate treatment and delay in appropriate care.\n6.3 Future Perspectives\nBased on the challenges discussed in this review, we present potential research directions that future researchers can explore to address these challenges and further enhance the application of ML in disease diagnosis:\nEnhanced Data Collection and Labeling: To address the challenge of insufficient labeled data, future research could explore techniques for data augmentation and active learning. Data augmentation methods can synthetically increase the size of the labeled dataset, while active learning can intelligently select the most informative data points for labeling, maximizing the model’s learning efficiency.\nRobustness and Adversarial Defense: To mitigate the risk of malicious attacks, researchers can focus on developing robust ML models with adversarial defense mechanisms. Adversarial training and detection techniques can help identify and handle adversarial examples, making ML models more secure and trustworthy in medical settings.\nData Preprocessing and Noise Handling: Innovative data preprocessing techniques and noise handling strategies can help reduce the impact of noisy data on ML models. Outlier detection, data cleaning, and robust feature extraction methods can enhance the model’s ability to extract meaningful patterns from noisy medical data.\nMulti-Model Ensembles: Combining multiple ML models in an ensemble can address the issue of disease misdiagnosis by leveraging the strengths of different algorithms. Ensemble methods can enhance the model’s overall accuracy and robustness, reducing the risk of misclassifications in complex medical scenarios.\nExplainable AI in Medical Diagnosis: The development of explainable AI techniques is crucial for increasing the interpretability of ML models in medical applications. Future research can focus on creating ML models that provide clear and transparent explanations for their predictions, enhancing trust and facilitating informed decision-making by healthcare professionals.\nTransfer Learning and Few-Shot Learning: Transfer learning and few-shot learning approaches can be explored to overcome data scarcity challenges. By leveraging pre-trained models on large datasets, ML models can be fine-tuned on limited medical data, enabling them to achieve better performance even with limited labeled samples.\nClinical Validation and Real-World Testing: To ensure the reliability and safety of ML-based medical applications, rigorous clinical validation and real-world testing are imperative. Future research should emphasize the deployment of ML models in clinical settings, where their performance can be evaluated under real-world conditions with diverse patient populations.\nCollaborative Research and Data Sharing: Collaboration between researchers, healthcare institutions, and data-sharing initiatives can significantly enhance the availability of medical data for ML research. Encouraging data sharing while maintaining patient privacy can foster advancements in ML-based medical diagnosis.\nIn conclusion, while ML algorithms have shown promising results in intelligent medical applications, several challenges still need to be addressed to unleash their full potential. By focusing on data availability, model robustness, interpretability, and clinical validation, researchers can pave the way for safer, more accurate, and reliable ML-based diagnostic systems. These future perspectives can drive progress in medical diagnostics, revolutionizing patient care and ultimately improving health outcomes.\n7 Conclusion\nIn conclusion, this review has provided a comprehensive overview of the application of ML methods in medical diagnostics, focusing on the early detection of various diseases including cancer, COVID-19, diabetes, kidney, and heart disease.

This review critically examines the recent advancements in AI applications within the field of neurology, emphasizing both the potential and limitations of these technologies. While AI demonstrates remarkable accuracy and speed in diagnostic imaging, outcome prediction, and personalized treatment plans, its integration into clinical practice remains challenged by ethical concerns, infrastructural limitations, and the “black box” nature of many AI algorithms. The review highlights the current gaps in literature, particularly the limited research on AI’s use in low-resource settings and its generalizability across diverse populations. Moreover, the review underscores the need for more longitudinal studies to assess the long-term efficacy of AI-driven interventions and calls for greater transparency in AI systems to enhance trust among clinicians. Future directions for AI in neurology emphasize the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration, regulatory oversight, and the development of equitable AI models that can benefit all patient populations. This review provides a balanced and comprehensive overview of AI’s role in neurology, offering insights into both the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead.\nKeywords: artificial intelligence, AI in diagnosis, neurology, neurology emergencies, AI in epilepsy\n1. Introduction\nBackground the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has brought revolutionary changes in major healthcare sectors, with improved tools and innovative ways for diagnosis and patient management. AI has shown a lot of promise in the field of neurology in the present day as regards both complex neurological disorder diagnosis and treatment. For instance, healthcare providers are tremendously challenged by neurological disorders due to stroke, traumatic brain injuries, epilepsy, among other acute situations, because of their complex nature and timely intervention needed in these cases. This is even more critical in emergent cases, where rapid and accurate diagnosis is needed for the right intervention on a patient. The application of AI in neurology is an extrapolation of successes made in other general areas of medicine, where large datasets have been analyzed by machine learning algorithms, neural networks, and other AI technologies to help predict outcomes and guide clinical decision-making. AI’s ability to process vast volumes of information quickly and accurately makes it a potent tool in the emerging diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders, where time plays a critical role (1).\nProblem Statement Although there have been enormous advancements in medical imaging, clinical protocols, and pharmacological treatments, timely diagnosis and effective treatment of emergent neurological conditions remains a herculean task. Also, traditional diagnostic methods are usually very time-consuming and require a lot of expertise, such as experience and, for the said reason, may not be easily accessed in case of an emergency (44). Similarly, complex neurological disorder treatments need to be customized for individual patients, making standard approaches less effective. AI has in it the potential to bridge these gaps with real-time diagnostic support and customizing treatment plans, based on huge datasets and predictive modeling. While this is its potential, AI is only at the very early stages of actual practice applications, such as emergent neurological cases. Current advancements are in need of comprehensive scrutiny due to the state of the field in the diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders with AI, which suggests specific places for further method development and research.\nWhile the advancements in AI for neurological care are promising, it is critical to acknowledge gaps in the current literature. Many existing reviews provide a broad overview of AI applications but fail to focus on emergent neurological situations where time-sensitive interventions are paramount. This article aims to fill that gap by reviewing the specific role of AI in diagnosing and managing acute neurological emergencies such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, and acute spinal cord injury. Moreover, prior reviews have not sufficiently discussed the ethical and practical challenges of integrating AI into real-world clinical settings, especially in low-resource environments. This comprehensive review will address these overlooked areas, providing a nuanced perspective on future research directions.\nAims the primary intention of the literature review is to assess the current state of AI-assisted diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders, with a particular focus on emergent cases. This review shall hence strive to:\nDiscuss recent developments in AI technologies relevant to emergent neurological disease diagnosis and treatment.\nEvaluate how well AI applications improve patient outcomes in the emergency setting.\nHighlight challenges and limitations in the implementation of AI in neurology.\nMake recommendations for future research and clinical practice.\nA well-structured review of this topic is essential to facilitate a clear understanding of AI’s transformative potential in neurology. This review will follow a systematic format to ensure coherence and clarity, covering recent technological developments, clinical applications, and the ethical implications of using AI in emergent neurological cases. By structuring the discussion around specific neurological emergencies, this review avoids the pitfalls of other articles that lack focus and cohesion. Additionally, we aim to highlight the limitations of current AI applications, thereby setting the stage for targeted research that can address these shortcomings in a meaningful way.\nPurpose and Usefulness As previously outlined, this literature review will cover studies published in the last 8 years that echo the most recent advances in AI and its applications in neurology. This review, therefore, looks at AI tools aiding in diagnoses, treatment planning, and management strategies for dealing with emergent cases of neurological disorders. Since there is an increased need for timely and accurate interventions in emergent cases, this review will focus on the role of AI on patient outcomes during such incidences (2).\n2. Methodology\nThis literature review was conducted to critically assess the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in the diagnosis and treatment of neurological emergencies, with a particular focus on emergent neurological conditions such as stroke, traumatic brain injury (TBI), and acute spinal cord injury. The review was structured to identify recent advancements, challenges, and future directions in AI applications within the neurology field.\n2.1. Literature search strategy\nThe literature search was performed using several academic databases, including PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Google Scholar, and Scopus, to identify peer-reviewed articles published between 2015 and 2023.

Synthesis of findings\nThe findings from the reviewed studies were synthesized to identify patterns in the successful application of AI technologies in neurology. Special attention was given to AI’s role in emergent neurological conditions where timely diagnosis and intervention are critical. The review also synthesized information on the barriers to AI implementation, including ethical considerations, data privacy concerns, biases in AI models, and the integration of AI in low-resource settings. Challenges such as the “black box” nature of AI and the difficulty in clinical validation were also discussed based on the literature reviewed.\n2.5. Quality assessment\nTo ensure the robustness of the findings, each study was critically evaluated based on its methodology, sample size, and the rigor of its AI model validation. Biases and limitations of each study were documented to provide a comprehensive and balanced view of AI’s potential in neurology.\n2.6. Ethical considerations\nEthical implications were also extracted and analyzed, particularly concerning data privacy, bias in AI models, and the need for transparency and explainability in AI-driven clinical decision-making. Studies that explored the ethical dimensions of AI in healthcare were incorporated to highlight gaps and provide recommendations for future research and clinical practice.\n3. AI in healthcare: an overview\nGeneral Applications of AI in Healthcare: Artificial intelligence very much remains an integral part of the modern-day healthcare paradigm, ranging from predictive analytics to personalized medicine. Fundamentally, AI utilizes machine learning algorithms, neural networks, and natural language processing for the analysis of huge data sets to identify patterns and make predictions. AI, thus empowered, has helped improve the very core elements of healthcare: diagnosis, treatments, planning, drug discovery, and patient management.\nA good application for this is diagnostic imaging, in which AI algorithms are being trained to analyze medical images like X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans with high accuracy. The studies have shown that AI systems could be comparable or even better than human experts when finding medical image abnormalities, thus making correct and faster diagnoses (3). For instance, in oncology cases where AI was applied in the detection of cancerous lesions on radiological images, a lot of time gets saved during detection, with a result of better patient outcomes (4).\nBesides imaging, AI is also applicable in predictive analytics for the identification of patients at risk of developing some diseases. Artificial intelligence using electronic health records and other clinical data provides a predictive way of the probability of an occurrence of a disease, hence enabling intervention measures to be instituted even for preventive purposes (5). This is of great use in the prognosis of chronic illnesses such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, whereby complications and adverse effects are prevented in order to reduce healthcare expenses.\n3.1. AI in neurology\nThe field of neurology has advanced greatly through the application of AI to combat the complexities associated with neurological disorders. Symptoms of neurological conditions are generally hard to quantify and follow by traditional techniques, and this is the key argument by proponents of AI such as Rao et al. (6). With its ability to handle huge amounts of data and detect subtle patterns, AI offers a totally new approach toward these diseases.\nThe application of AI in neurology is best illustrated in diagnostic imaging. The brain images are subjected to analysis of late by use of techniques that include deep learning, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to detect and diagnose the symptoms of any upcoming potential neurological disorder. For example, AI algorithms used to find early signs of Alzheimer’s disease by studying the structure and functional MRI scans can detect those even before the clinical symptoms start to manifest in patients (7). This helps in early detection, which could play a very important role in slowing the advance of the disease and improving the quality of life for such patients.\nBesides imaging, the application of AI is seen in the analysis of EEGs for various epileptic seizure disorders and other such disorders. An analysis of an EEG by conventional procedures is both time-consuming and needs expert interpretation. AI-based systems can automate the procedure and thereby result in a quick and at-the-same-time accurate diagnosis (8). This is particularly relevant in the emergent cases of neurology, where timely diagnosis can go a long way in determining outcome post-therapy.\nEmerging Technologies in AI-Assisted Neurology: Currently, several emerging technologies are underway and will shape AI research in neurology with the potential to revolutionize diagnosis and treatment. For example, one of these technologies would be deep learning, a distinctive way of modeling complicated patterns within the data. In recent years, deep learning algorithms have been utilized to comprehend various neurological conditions’ disease mechanisms and possible therapeutic targets, which seemed to increase in relevance considerably recently (9).\nReinforcement learning, a subfield of machine learning, is another promising technology where algorithms learn through the environment they interact with to make decisions. In neurology, reinforcement learning has been applied in the development of neurorehabilitation systems during interaction with patients—a characteristic AI device that caters to changes in progression, offering personalized therapy options (10).\nIn addition, NLP is increasingly being applied in neurology for the purposes of the analysis of patient records and clinical notes. Valuable information, especially on symptoms, treatment responses, and disease progression, present in free text, can be obtained from the application of NLP algorithms in regard to a patient’s condition (11).\n3.2. AI in emergent neurological cases\nEmergent neurological cases, such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, and acute spinal cord injury, demand timely management. AI has proved its potential in such cases by giving rapid diagnostic support and aiding at critical junctures of decision-making (12). For example, AI algorithms were created in stroke cases to analyze imaging data and identify patients who would benefit from thrombolysis or thrombectomy; this vastly reduced the time required for treatment and resulted in better outcomes.\nThe use of AI systems to predict outcomes and guide decisions on treatment with data from the patient, including imaging, vital signs, and clinical history, is tremendous. Such AI-enabled insights would aid clinicians in making prioritized interventions and better allocate resources in settings with constrained resources.\n3.3. Limitations of AI in neurological emergencies\nWhile the potential for AI in neurology, particularly in emergent situations, is well-documented, the technology is not without limitations. One major challenge is the “black box” nature of many AI algorithms, especially those based on deep learning models. These models can generate accurate predictions, but their inner workings are often opaque to clinicians, leading to concerns about the interpretability of AI-assisted diagnoses and treatments (13). This lack of transparency can hinder trust and adoption in clinical settings, as healthcare providers may be hesitant to rely on systems they do not fully understand.\nMoreover, AI algorithms are only as good as the data they are trained on. Bias in AI systems is a well-recognized issue, particularly in healthcare, where training data may not adequately represent diverse patient populations. For example, AI systems trained predominantly on data from Western populations may not perform as well for patients from different ethnic backgrounds, potentially leading to misdiagnoses or suboptimal care (14). This raises ethical concerns, especially in high-stakes emergent cases where AI recommendations could significantly influence patient outcomes.\nFurthermore, the clinical validation of AI tools in real-world settings remains a significant hurdle. Many AI systems have shown promising results in controlled research environments but have yet to be thoroughly tested in everyday clinical practice, particularly in low-resource settings. The transferability of these technologies to varied healthcare environments is still questionable, as resource limitations may affect the deployment and reliability of AI systems (15). These limitations underscore the need for more comprehensive and transparent AI systems that can be trusted by clinicians and patients alike.\n4. Computer-aided diagnosis of neurological disorders\n4.1. AI in diagnostic imaging\nOne of the most important fields in which AI has contributed much to Neurology is Diagnostic Imaging. Traditional imaging techniques—beans, CT scans, and PET scans—are basically diagnostic pieces of equipment for neurological disorders. Still, their interpretation may be pretty subjective and time-consuming, needing highly specialized radiologists. AI has emerged as a power tool in the realm of imaging analysis, especially for improving accuracy and efficiency through deep learning algorithms.\nEven though the recent research evidence has been able to illustrate that AI can be applied in neurological conditions diagnosis using imaging, the history of artificial intelligence implementation dates back to over three decades ago. For instance, CNNs were designedly trained for the detecting early signs of Alzheimer’s disease by reviewing structural MRI scans. The AI systems showed an accuracy close to that of expert radiologists with faster processing times added as an advantage (4). Early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease is important for timely institution of intervention measures that might retard the process.\nAI has already been used in providing great promise to assist in a rapid diagnosis concerning emergent neurology cases, such as acute ischemic stroke. Stroke is a significant cause of worldwide disability and death with a narrow window for effective treatment. Algorithms have been developed that are AI-driven for image analysis in CT and MRI, which one can leverage quickly to capture stroke type and occluded blood vessels and assess the extent of damage in the brain. Diagnostic tools like these, powered by AI-driven innovation, would increasingly help reduce time to treatment, a critical determinant of patient outcome (16).\n4.2. AI in EEG analysis\nElectroencephalography is another vital tool in establishing the diagnosis of neurological disorders, more especially in epilepsy. Traditionally, the analysis of EEG data used to take a lot of time since it required manual interpretation by neurologists. AI has revolutionized EEG analysis with automatization of detecting abnormal brain wave activity associated with seizures and other neurological conditions.\nDeep learning models, particularly recurrent neural networks and long short-term memory networks, have been applied to EEG data in epileptic seizure prediction with a high degree of accuracy. The models are capable of going through a large data set from EEG recordings to come up with a pattern indicating seizure events that may not be observable by human eyes at any immediate instance. This is particularly useful in view of emergency situations where the time factor is pretty crucial for diagnosis and intervention.\nNevertheless, application of AI to seizure prediction has opened a window for preventive interventions. According to some studies, AI models trained with EEG data predict seizures minutes or even hours in advance, thus offering sufficiently large benefits for epilepsy management.\n4.3. AI in the diagnosis of traumatic brain injury (TBI)\nTBI is one of those critically important conditions that require immediate attention and treatment to prevent long-term neurological damage or even death. Diagnosis in cases of TBI mostly involves the use of imaging techniques, particularly CT, to determine the extent of injury to the brain. Traditional imaging techniques have usually failed in detecting subtle changes to brain structure and function following TBI due to its subtle nature of alterations.\nMore recently, AI has been, this way, applied to support the diagnosis of TBI via analysis of imaging data, with clinical variables down the line. Machine learning models have been constructed to better predict the outcomes for TBI patients from CT scan data, vital signs, and others like clinical indicators. AI-driven predictions could input into critical decisions about appropriateness related to the urgency of intervention, the need for ICU care, and potential for recovery (17).\nAI applications in neuropsychological assessments used for the diagnosis of TBI have also been applied alongside imaging. For example, the speech and language patterns of TBI patients were examined to glean insights into such cognitive impairments that lie hidden in imaging alone using NLP algorithms. It is then that this kind of multi-modal approach to diagnosis, combining imaging, clinical data, and neuropsychological assessment, held great promise in management with regard to TBI.\n4.4. Case studies and applications to real life\nSeveral case studies and real-world applications have attested to the effectiveness of AI in diagnose neurological disorders. For example, McKinney et al. (18) conducted a study that revealed the use of AI in the diagnosis of an acute stroke in a large clinical setting. It reported an AI system that could identify stroke on computed tomography scanner images virtually as well as expert radiologists do—yet significantly eased diagnosis time. This time-to-diagnosis reduction is incisive in emergent cases where every minute counts.\nAnother very good example is the application of AI in Parkinson’s disease diagnosis. AI models are trained using MRI and PET scans to detect the first manifestations of Parkinson’s, often before motor symptoms start to set in. Early diagnosis instituting treatments that slow down the progression of the disease drives better patient outcomes.\nAI has been successfully applied to epilepsy care in recent times, in relation to patient monitoring and seizure prediction. For instance, Kuhlmann et al. (19) presented an example where AI was applied in predicting seizures for patients with refractory epilepsy. The system supplied proper predictions of seizure episodes, facilitating interventions on time and thus reducing the frequency of seizures.\nCase examples in the next sections demonstrate the potential for AI to greatly affect a sea-change in neurological disorder diagnosis. As the development of AI progresses, so will the applications move into neurology, opening more opportunities in routine and emergent cases for early and accurate diagnoses.\n5. AI in treatment and management of neurological disorders\n5.1. AI-guided treatment plans\nEspecially with neurology, where patients require personalized treatment approaches because of the nature of neurological disorders—both complicated and variable—AI in treatment planning has shown remarkable promise. Recent AI-driven systems analyze big datasets, like patient history, genetic information, and clinical biomarkers, in developing personalized treatments that fit the patients’ profile. These include state-of-the-art innovations in treatment planning for patients with epilepsy. This is considered important in such conditions as epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson’s, for the treatment response of which patients sometimes show a widely differing extent.\nHowever, AI has been used to build models informed by a lot of data obtained through clinical trials and the outcomes of real-world cases related to predicting the optimal medication dosage for patients with epilepsy in a way that minimized risks yet maximized therapeutic efficacy (20). The models use machine learning algorithms to study data obtained from analyses of clinical trials and real-world patient outcomes, hence giving out better treatment options.\nIn the field of Parkinson’s disease management, AI has been utilized in the optimization of deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapy processes. DBS is a well-known and effective treatment for Parkinson’s, but its effectiveness depends on the precision of electrode placement and the setting of parameters, which are difficult to optimize by hand. Unfortunately, the management of systems with more complex representation is not that easy and could be done manually. AI-based algorithms to analyze patient-specific information reportedly lead to optimal DBS parameters, new treatment outcomes, and improvements. A good overview of the field was discussed and summarized by Kühn and Volkmann (21).\n5.2. Surgical assistance\nNeurosurgery is one of the tough-to-handle surgical specialties and needs relatively greater precision and technique. With this regard, AI has started to implement neurosurgical procedures, aiming to deliver real-time decision support and improve the surgical outcome produced in return. AI-driven surgical robotics and navigation systems have been reported in neurological surgeries with elements of complexity, such as resection of tumors and interventions to address spinal surgery (22), in line with that.\nA significant number of applications for AI implementation in neurosurgery relate to brain tumor surgical planning and execution. Conventional surgical planning depends on the surgeon’s experience and judgment, although AI systems are capable of conducting preoperative imaging data analysis for creating 3D models, hence the neuronavigation tackle relevant to information on these models. Such showcases work to let surgeons know exactly where to make the incision so that they cause as little damage as possible to the healthy tissue around a tumor (23).\nIn this sense, an AI-powered robotic system can take part in helping the instruments get feedback during a surgery, maintaining its steadiness and offering real-time feedback to the surgeon. With this approach, it will be more accurate, will reduce the effect of human fallibility, and will allow undertakings that are less aggressive. For example, AI-supported robotic systems, such as ROSA and Mazor X, have led to increased surgical accuracy and decreased recovery times in spinal surgeries and deep brain stimulation procedures, respectively. AiBootApplication.\n5.3. Rehabilitation and long-term management\nNotably, the role of AI applies beyond acute treatment to rehabilitation and long-term management in neurological disorders. Motor and cognitive recovery in patients suffering from rehabilitation period.\nTrueAIhas helped develop the leading personal rehabilitation programs, which are based on patients’ progress. Machine learning algorithms analyze rehabilitation session data to read patterns of movement and recovery metrics, in order to make real-time adjustments to therapy protocols. For example, AI-enabled exoskeletons and robotic devices provide assistance to patients in carrying out repetitive movements involved in physical therapy, with features like real-time feedback and setting resistance according to the ability of the patient. For interventions on a more precise level, robotic devices may sometimes be incorporated into traditional physical therapy. For instance, robotic gait trainers can enable walking movements for (39).\nApart from physical rehabilitation, AI has also been incorporated into cognitive rehabilitation for patients with brain injuries and neurodegenerative diseases. Artificial intelligence-powered platforms can deliver personalized cognitive exercises for the irregularities of a specific patient, can systematically track the progress of the activities, and even modulate the difficulties during the course of the improvement tempo (24). These types of systems can find effective use in further elicitation of cognitive recovery in stroke patients and those suffering from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (25, 40).\nMore importantly, AI applications will be important in the long-term monitoring of a patient and management. For instance, wearable devices and mobile health apps with AI abilities will be useful in monitoring vital signs and patterns of movement and symptoms delivery in real time to healthcare providers (26). For instance, AI-driven apps have been useful to monitor the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease like tremors and abnormalities in the gait, allowing the remote adjustment in clinical management for patients with the disease carved out herein (27). Continuous monitoring comes very handy in chronic neurological conditions because it can help reveal the course of chronologically developing symptoms that might prevent later complications and hospitalizations (42).\n5.4. Case-based studies and real-life applications\nSeveral real-world applications highlight the transformation that the AI field is having in the treatment and management of neurological disorders. A good example is the optimization of the treatment plan for conditions such as strokes. A study by McKinney et al. (18) has also proven that the AI system can review patient information, imaging, and clinical history to give a recommendation for the best thrombolytic therapy or the best surgical operation. This AI-driven approach reduced time to treatment and improved patient outcomes in acute cases of stroke.\nRobotic systems incorporated with the help of AI in neurosurgery have shown that successfully conducted complex resections. A case report documented by Shen et al. (22) was performed on the use of an AI-driven robotic system during a resection of glioblastoma, one of the most aggressive forms of brain cancer. The robotic system is capable of providing real-time feedback before and during surgery to allow the surgeon to conduct better resection with minimed damage to neighborhood tissues for good patient outcomes.\nAI-exoskeletons have also been used for stroke patients. A study by Mehrholz et al. (28) has shown that stroke patients using AI exoskeletons for their rehabilitation had significantly better mobility and functional independence as compared to those treated with conventional therapy.\nThese are illustrative of the potential of AI in changing the very landscape of treatment and management in neurological disorders and thus give fresh hope both to the patient and the clinician.\n6. Ethical and practical concerns\n6.1. Ethical implications\nThe excessively rapid uptake of AI in neurological diagnosis and treatment raises numerous very serious ethical issues and, if not handled properly, it could tilt the scales toward responsible and fair use. One major issue of AI that comes to the focus with such a rapid uptake is bias within the algorithms. AI systems in nature are based on gigantic datasets, and lack of representation of diversified population in these datasets may be a significant problem where the developed algorithms continue their existence discretely. For example, research indicates that models of AI that are largely trained on data from certain ethnic groups are less accurate for patients from other backgrounds, with possible outcomes of misdiagnosis—and underdiagnosis—and less than optimal care (14).\nSelection of such datasets must be diverse and represent the population to avoid this issue. This also requires that there be transparency in both the development and the deployment stages of the AIs; both the clinicians and patients need to know how the decisions are being made by an AI algorithm and therefore know what limitations or bias are possible (29). Maintaining ethical AI practice also needs ongoing monitoring and validation of the AI systems to prove that they will perform equally well with all patients (41).\nAnother important ethical issue surrounding AI in healthcare is privacy and data security. The accuracies of AI systems for treating patients come from its training with very large pools of patient data that are essentially medical records, imaging data, and genetic information. Such a sensitive use of data raises concerns about its misuse and unauthorized access or potential breach with such large pools of sensitive personal health information. Privacy and security of patient data are very critical; the data should, therefore, be well protected with strong protection mechanisms to ensure that the data is secure.\nAnother critical ethical consideration is that of informed consent in using AI in healthcare. It is important that patients are properly informed on how AI systems would be used and the basis of the data to be collected and the use to which such data will be put. Correctly, patients should be given the chance not to receive AI-driven interventions if they would prefer the traditional method of care. Ensuring that patients are aware of their rights and that they have autonomy in their healthcare decisions is essential in maintaining trust in AI technologies.\nThere comes the issue of accountability and responsibility whenever AI is utilized toward care. Sure, AI systems generate enormous insights and in many instances give recommendations, but in the end, the liability associated with clinical decisions lies with human providers. Of the greatest significance is the guidance on how the recommendations made by AI should be integrated into clinical practice: the final decision regarding the treatment has to rely on the judgment of professionals and patient preferences (30).\nEthical considerations are crucial when discussing the deployment of AI in neurological emergencies. A significant concern is the transparency of AI decision-making processes, often referred to as the “black box” problem. Clinicians and patients alike may struggle to trust AI-driven recommendations without a clear understanding of how the system arrives at these conclusions. Furthermore, regulatory frameworks for AI in healthcare remain underdeveloped, making it challenging to ensure that AI systems meet the required standards of safety and efficacy. Comprehensive guidelines and strict regulatory oversight are needed to prevent misuse and ensure that AI technologies are deployed responsibly.\n6.2. Practical challenges\nLaying aside ethical concerns, some practical ones in respect to how AI can really be transformed and integrated with usable healthcare clinical practices points to problems in regard to interoperability: In this line, most of the hospitals and clinics currently in play lack proper interoperation of sophisticated AI systems and legacy systems of healthcare infrastructure. Serious efforts should be applied to establish appropriate compatibility of the advanced modern AI technologies with the popular legacy systems prevalent in most of the hospitals and clinics. Upgrading these systems to AI tool accommodation would be time and resource-consuming, which will thus represent a critical challenge in making the technologies widely accepted.\nIn addition, clinical applications will call for significant training of the healthcare workforce. Ideally, the medical workforce should be trained in the utilization of such AI tools, interpret results and integrate them for better understanding of patient care (31). That is bound to call for realignment in the medical-education framework and shift in training programs to allow for the next generation of healthcare associates to be conversant with these AI technologies.\nYet another practical challenge lies in health care AI regulation. The regulatory entities have yet established frameworks for the specific evaluation of safety and efficacy for medical devices and software driven by AI, according to Bakker et al. (32). Assurance that AI systems meet requirements can be a long and painstaking procedure; thus, critical technologies are likely to remain partners in some cases without deployment in clinical settings.\nBesides that, the implementation of AI may be very costly, enough for most healthcare institutions, especially the low-resource ones, to not afford. While AI has the potential to cut health service costs in the long term, since it is efficient and enhances health outcomes, the high magnitude of the required investment in infrastructure, training, and integration of AI services could be substantial. Rising to all the financial challenges will be crucial to realize the benefits of AI for all patients regardless of geography or economic status.\nFinally, there is the issue of acceptance. Apart from the anticipated improvement that may come from AI, any form of impact or changes in the tasks from work might be among those reasons that the healthcare professional is apprehensive of using the technology because it means dispossession of work, loss of control, and others (15). Embracing AI in neurology as a valuable tool throughout the field, and even beyond it, will be of paramount importance in building trust for these systems and showcasing their clinical validation and value throughout real-world success stories.\n6.3. Balancing innovation with responsibility\nThe practical and ethical challenges associated with AI in neurology underline the need for a balanced approach that holds concerns of innovation and responsibility with equal respect. While AI offers the potential to completely revolutionize the process of diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders, it is, at the same time, very important that development and deployment of such technologies be carried out in a fair manner that is transparent and according to the highest standards of patient care.\nThis will likely emanate from collaborative working of AI developers, healthcare providers, patients, and regulatory bodies, who might work together in order to ensure AI technologies work in a manner that supports all patients, addresses all ethical concerns, and overcomes all practical challenges. In this way, all potential ways of AI application in neurology would be fully realized, thereby offering new hope for patients with neurological disorders but at the same time maintaining the trust and confidence of the healthcare community.\n7. Broader applications of AI in neurology\nTo provide a comprehensive review of AI’s role in neurology, it is crucial to broaden the scope beyond its well-established applications, such as in stroke, Alzheimer’s disease, and epilepsy. AI technologies hold vast potential for addressing a wider range of neurological conditions, particularly those that have historically been underrepresented in the literature. Expanding research in this area would allow AI to demonstrate its versatility and impact across various complex and rare neurological disorders.\nOne of the emerging areas where AI can play a transformative role is in neurogenomics. AI has the ability to analyze large volumes of genetic data to identify patterns and genetic mutations associated with neurological conditions. For example, AI-driven tools are increasingly being used to predict disease onset and progression in disorders like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Huntington’s disease (9). By integrating neuroimaging, genetic data, and clinical biomarkers, AI can help clinicians develop personalized treatment strategies tailored to a patient’s unique genetic profile, which is particularly relevant in managing these neurodegenerative diseases where early detection is critical (7).\nIn addition, AI has shown promise in the management of movement disorders such as Parkinson’s disease. Beyond diagnostic imaging and predictive analytics, AI can be used to optimize treatment plans for patients receiving deep brain stimulation (DBS). By analyzing patient data in real time, AI systems can adjust stimulation parameters to provide more precise therapeutic outcomes (21). This capability allows for continuous, personalized care, reducing the need for frequent hospital visits and improving the quality of life for patients with chronic movement disorders.\nAnother area where AI could expand its application is in mental health and cognitive disorders. AI-driven models have been developed to assist in the diagnosis of psychiatric and cognitive disorders like depression, schizophrenia, and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (7). AI can analyze speech patterns, facial expressions, and behavioral data to detect early signs of cognitive decline, offering potential for early interventions in conditions like dementia. This approach provides clinicians with real-time insights that go beyond traditional cognitive assessments, allowing for a more dynamic and individualized understanding of patient progress.\nFurthermore, AI can be instrumental in identifying biomarkers and developing predictive models for rarer conditions, such as multiple system atrophy (MSA) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). These diseases often have overlapping symptoms with more common conditions, making early and accurate diagnosis challenging. AI algorithms trained on multimodal data—encompassing neuroimaging, clinical records, and genetic information—can help differentiate between these disorders, providing more timely and accurate diagnoses (33).\nDespite these promising developments, there is still limited research on AI’s application to these broader neurological conditions. Future research must focus on expanding AI models to cover a wider array of neurological diseases, ensuring that these technologies benefit all patients, not just those with more commonly studied disorders. Collaborative efforts between neurologists, AI researchers, and healthcare providers will be essential in developing AI systems that can be generalized across diverse neurological conditions, leading to more inclusive and equitable healthcare solutions.\n8. Comparative analysis: AI vs. traditional methods in neurological emergencies\nFor AI to truly transform the field of neurology, its applications must be critically compared to traditional diagnostic and treatment methods. While AI offers significant advantages in speed, precision, and the ability to process vast datasets, traditional methods still hold value in various clinical contexts, especially when considering the expertise of seasoned clinicians and the established reliability of manual diagnostic techniques.\nOne of the most well-recognized benefits of AI is its ability to analyze complex imaging data far more rapidly than human clinicians. For example, AI algorithms applied to CT and MRI scans in stroke cases can reduce diagnosis time from hours to minutes, a critical factor in improving patient outcomes (18). These algorithms can also detect subtle abnormalities that might be missed by human eyes, particularly in time-sensitive conditions like ischemic stroke, where quick identification of occlusions can determine whether a patient is a candidate for thrombolytic therapy (12).\nHowever, traditional methods, particularly manual interpretation of imaging data, still play an essential role, especially in cases where clinical judgment and experience are needed to contextualize findings. For instance, while AI can flag potential abnormalities, it may struggle with atypical presentations that experienced radiologists or neurologists could interpret within the broader clinical picture (3). The complexity of neurological emergencies often requires the integration of multiple diagnostic inputs, including clinical history, laboratory results, and imaging studies—areas where human clinicians excel in synthesizing information for comprehensive decision-making.\nMoreover, the robustness of AI in real-world clinical settings, particularly in low-resource environments, remains a significant concern. Traditional methods, though time-consuming, do not rely on advanced infrastructure, making them more accessible in healthcare settings with limited resources. This is a critical advantage when deploying diagnostic tools in rural or underserved areas, where AI-driven systems requiring high computational power and sophisticated hardware may not be feasible (34). In such settings, traditional methods remain the gold standard for ensuring patients receive adequate care.\nAnother area of comparison is in treatment personalization. AI-driven treatment plans, particularly for conditions like epilepsy and Parkinson’s disease, leverage vast amounts of patient data to recommend highly personalized therapies (9). However, traditional clinical decision-making, informed by years of medical experience, offers a level of intuition that AI systems currently lack. For example, while AI might suggest optimal DBS (Deep Brain Stimulation) settings for a Parkinson’s patient based on data, a neurologist’s familiarity with the patient’s nuanced responses to treatment can guide adjustments that enhance the patient’s quality of life (21).\nFinally, AI and traditional methods differ in how they handle the element of uncertainty in neurological care. AI systems rely on probabilistic models that calculate the likelihood of outcomes based on available data. While this approach offers a level of precision and objectivity, it may fall short in cases where the data is incomplete or ambiguous. On the other hand, experienced clinicians are often adept at navigating uncertainty, making judgment calls based on intuition and years of practice—an area where AI has yet to match human capability (35).\nIn conclusion, AI offers clear advantages in terms of speed and data processing but still requires integration with traditional clinical methods, particularly in complex or resource-limited settings. Future research should focus on developing hybrid models that combine AI’s computational power with the clinical expertise of human neurologists, ensuring that both tools are used in complementary ways to improve patient outcomes in neurological emergencies.\n9. Future directions and recommendations\n9.1. Emerging trends in AI-assisted neurology\nAI in neurology heralds a bright future with the lightning advances made in machine learning, data analytics, and computational power. Many emerging trends are set to shape the future of AI-assisted diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders.\nOne of these trends is in multimodal approaches from AI frameworks, which combine different realms of data—imaging, genetic information, and clinical biomarkers—toward characterizing a condition for more complete and accurate diagnoses. Such systems combined from various sources can therefore help to realize much better diagnosis accuracy and avert several misdiagnoses that might be averted in hard neurological conditions. For example, genomics data can be combined with imaging results in diseases like brain tumors and neurodegenerative diseases to give valuable evidence for precision treatment strategies (24).\nNeurogenomics represents a second most impactful emerging area that is being exposed by AI. Recent advances in the field of genomics and increasing volumes of available genetic data open up opportunities for AI discovery and corresponding targeted neurogenomic therapeutic interventions. Analysis driven by AI of these genetic data may well lead to more targeted therapy in general with respect to more accurate diagnoses of treatment—especially for serious genetically based conditions like Huntington’s disease and ALS (9).\nIn the case of another line, AI is growingly used to develop predictive models for the neurological disorder of interest. Such high-risk groups can lead, for example, to conditions such as Alzheimer’s or stroke, and early intervention and preventive therapy can be taken. Predictive analytics, with the help of AI, changes the field of neurology by switching it from a reactive to a proactive regime. It can avert the onset and reduce the progression of disease.\nAnother ray of hope is the integration of AI along with wearable devices and telemedicine platforms. Wearable devices with built-in AI models may offer continuous neuro health monitoring of patients, with the detection of initial manifestations of decline and real-time alerting to a healthcare provider. The importance of continuous monitoring cannot be overemphasized, since timely changes in treatment planning may prevent complications for such patients with chronic disorders as Parkinson’s disease or epilepsy.\n9.2. Recommendations for clinical practice\nSeveral catalyzers realize the full potential that AI can make in neurology for successful integration into clinical practice. Therefore, the following recommendations are proposed for healthcare providers along with policymakers and researchers to facilitate the adoption of AI technologies in neurology:\nInfrastructure Investment in AI: Investment in the infrastructure needed, within healthcare institutions, to support AI technologies, such as advanced computing systems, data storage solutions, and secure networks. Such an investment is important in embedding AI systems into the existing workflow in the clinics in such a manner that it is best used.\nIMPROVE QUALITY OF DATA AND DIVERSITY: AI models ought to be trained on diverse good quality data so that it can reduce bias and improve generalizability. Potential ways to ensure data are drawn from diverse patient populations, possibly including underrepresented groups, to ensure that AI systems are continuously oriented to operate equally across different subgroups, should an effort become prevalent toward these ends.\nPromoting a Collaborative Interdisciplinary Field the Development of: Developing and applying AI in neurology requires a coordinated effort of AI development professionals, neurologists, and radiologists. It needs the cooperation of geneticists and other professionals working in healthcare. Systems developed by interdisciplinary teams will link the differences between technology and clinical practice into systems that are developed holistically to account for differences in the needs and priorities of patients and clinicians (30).\nEthical and Regulatory Compliance: AI developers should, therefore, put serious first consideration on ethics and observe regulatory standards. This pits several aspects that touch on privacy and data protection, informed consent issues, and general issues of accountability when AI systems are deployed into clinical settings, as has been postulated by numerous authors (29).\nInvestment in Clinician Education and Training: Both medical education curricula and training programs should include AI-augmented activities and protocols, preparing healthcare providers in this environment. Equally essential is having the knowledge clinicians must possess for better interpretation and integration of AI-sourced insights while providing care and recognizing AI’s capabilities and limitations in the process (36).\nSupport Ongoing Research and Development: Research in the development of AI applications for neurology needs continued support in order to either optimize existing solutions or keep pace with the development of new solutions. Specifically, funding agencies and academic institutions should ensure continuous support for research work that focuses on developing new AI solutions promising to support improvements in the diagnosis, management, and treatment of neurological disorders.\n9.3. Research gaps and future studies\nDespite its tremendous potential in the field of neurology, there are still certain important research gaps that need to be addressed in future studies. Among the most crucial, though, is another call for studies to be longitudinal investigations that assess the effects of AI-driven interventions over a long period of patient outcomes. Although most of the studies indicate the short-term benefits that AI brings, knowledge about its effects for a long term is of importance in knowing the worth or value conferred in clinical practice.\nAnother research gap is the development of explainable models of AI. Whereas AI systems could provide, with a good degree of accuracy, predictions and recommendations, they often acted like “black boxes” that are hard to understand at a deep level by clinicians. Development of transparent and explainable AI models will go a long way in engendering trust among healthcare providers in AI-driven decisions and ensuring that they are well understood and actionable (13).\nIn addition, ethical implications around issues of bias, fairness, and accountability necessitate more research on applied AI to neurology. It is a necessity to find ways in which biases in the AI systems are reduced to assure the developed technologies will be used equitably across all patient populations (37).\nFuture research in AI for neurological emergencies must focus on creating more interpretable and transparent AI systems. While deep learning models have shown great promise, their complexity often makes it difficult for clinicians to understand the rationale behind their recommendations. Developing explainable AI models will not only foster greater trust in these systems but also improve clinical adoption. Additionally, there is a need for longitudinal studies that assess the long-term outcomes of AI-driven interventions. Most current studies focus on immediate improvements, but the sustainability of these benefits over time remains unclear. Addressing these gaps is critical to ensuring the widespread and equitable application of AI in neurology.\nDespite the promising strides made in AI applications for neurological emergencies, significant gaps remain in the current body of research. One key area that has been underexplored is the deployment of AI in low-resource settings. Most AI technologies in neurology are developed and tested in high-resource environments equipped with state-of-the-art imaging devices and computational infrastructure (34). However, in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where healthcare resources are scarce, the implementation of these AI systems faces considerable challenges. Research is urgently needed to modify AI systems for use in such settings, focusing on technologies that require less computational power, can work with limited or lower-quality data, and are cost-effective (38). The lack of studies in this area exacerbates the global inequality in healthcare access, and addressing this gap is crucial for ensuring that AI can benefit patients worldwide, regardless of geographic or economic barriers (43).\nAnother gap in the literature pertains to the long-term efficacy of AI-driven interventions. While there is substantial evidence showing the short-term benefits of AI in acute neurological conditions, such as rapid diagnosis and treatment of stroke (12), the impact of these interventions over extended periods remains unclear. For example, the use of AI in predicting stroke outcomes has demonstrated immediate improvements in treatment speed, but studies rarely follow patients long enough to evaluate the sustainability of these outcomes (18). Longitudinal studies are necessary to assess whether AI-driven improvements in the acute phase translate into long-term health benefits, particularly in managing chronic conditions like epilepsy and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Furthermore, these studies should investigate how AI-driven diagnostics and treatments affect patients’ quality of life, rehabilitation outcomes, and overall healthcare costs in the long term (35).\nAdditionally, the literature is disproportionately focused on a handful of well-known neurological conditions, such as stroke, Alzheimer’s disease, and epilepsy, while rare and complex conditions remain largely unexplored (9). For instance, there is a scarcity of studies examining AI’s potential in diagnosing and managing conditions like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Huntington’s disease, despite the fact that these diseases could greatly benefit from the pattern recognition and predictive capabilities of AI systems (7). Expanding research to include these less common but equally devastating neurological disorders is essential for creating a comprehensive understanding of AI’s role in neurology.\nLastly, researchers need to develop knowledge of how the technology might be scaled up and made more accessible in the future, in the understudied conditions of low-resource use. Although developed, AI had captured significant goodwill where high-resource conditions prevail, several issues underscore the need for technologists and developers to develop insights about how these technologies will be transported for use in low-resource-exploiting conditions, where advanced medical care afforded by high-resource usage is too expensive. This is important for developing AI solutions that are affordable and scalable and therefore would ensure benefits in neurology are made available to all patients, regardless of their origin or economic status.\nFunding Statement\nThe author(s) declare that no financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nAuthor contributions\nMA: Writing – review & editing, Writing – original draft, Visualization, Resources, Formal analysis, Conceptualization.

Accurately predicting cardiovascular disease poses a significant challenge within clinical data analysis. The present study introduces a prediction model that utilizes various combinations of information and employs multiple established classification approaches. The proposed technique combines the genetic algorithm (GA) and the recursive feature elimination method (RFEM) to select relevant features, thus enhancing the model’s robustness. Techniques like the under sampling clustering oversampling method (USCOM) address the issue of data imbalance, thereby improving the model’s predictive capabilities. The classification challenge employs a multilayer deep convolutional neural network (MLDCNN), trained using the adaptive elephant herd optimization method (AEHOM). The proposed machine learning-based heart disease prediction method (ML-HDPM) demonstrates outstanding performance across various crucial evaluation parameters, as indicated by its comprehensive assessment. During the training process, the ML-HDPM model exhibits a high level of performance, achieving an accuracy rate of 95.5% and a precision rate of 94.8%. The system’s sensitivity (recall) performs with a high accuracy rate of 96.2%, while the F-score highlights its well-balanced performance, measuring 91.5%. It is worth noting that the specificity of ML-HDPM is recorded at a remarkable 89.7%. The findings underscore the potential of ML-HDPM to transform the prediction of heart disease and aid healthcare practitioners in providing precise diagnoses, exerting a substantial influence on patient care outcomes.\nSimilar content being viewed by others\nIntroduction\nHealthcare encompasses a range of disciplines. It focuses on preventing, diagnosing, treating, and caring for illnesses and ailments that impact people’s and communities’ overall health and welfare1. The scope of services is extensive, including diverse offerings such as medical exams, interventions, psychological assistance, and public health activities. Healthcare professionals, encompassing a diverse range of individuals such as physicians, nurses, therapists, and researchers, engage in collaborative efforts to safeguard the whole well-being of patients, surrounding their physical, mental, and emotional health. Alongside clinical treatment, healthcare contains health information, illness prevention, and health advancement, all of which improve the overall quality of life2.\nHeart disease, an often-seen and frequently consequential medical ailment, has a profound interdependence with the broader healthcare domain3. Heart disease is a significant contributor to illness and death worldwide, underscoring the crucial role of healthcare systems in tackling pressing health concerns. Heart disease comprises a range of conditions that impact the heart and blood arteries, including heart failure, coronary artery disease, arrhythmias, and valve abnormalities. Healthcare professionals are crucial in diagnosing heart disease by using medical evaluations, employing modern imaging methods, and conducting diagnostic procedures4. The management of the condition involves a comprehensive approach encompassing lifestyle adjustments, pharmaceutical therapies, and surgical procedures, highlighting the need for interdisciplinary cooperation among healthcare professionals. Healthcare efforts that prioritize the promotion of heart-healthy habits, the enhancement of perception, and the advocacy for early detection play a crucial role in mitigating the prevalence of heart disease and enhancing cardiovascular well-being on a broader scope. Examining and controlling cardiovascular disease exemplify the complex interaction between healthcare and the welfare of people and society5.\nCardiovascular disorders rank first among the most lethal illnesses. They are well recognized as a significant contributor to mortality on a worldwide scale6. Based on statistical data from the World Health Organization, it was reported that cardiac disorders were responsible for about 18 million fatalities in 2016. In the United States, cardiovascular illnesses, including heart disease, hypertension, and stroke, are the leading causes of mortality. Cardiovascular heart disease (CHD) is responsible for about one-seventh of all fatalities in the United States, resulting in an estimated yearly death toll of 3 million individuals7. The prevalence of myocardial infarctions in the United States is roughly 7.9 million, accounting for approximately 3% of heart attack incidents among American adults. In the year 2015, a total of 1 million individuals inside a single nation succumbed to fatalities resulting from heart attacks8. Based on the findings of a study, the symptoms associated with heart disease include a range of manifestations such as chest tightness, discomfort, pressure, breath shortness, leg shivers, neck pain, abdomen pain, tachycardia, dizziness, bradycardia, fainting, syncope, which skin color modifications, leg swelling, weight loss, and weariness9. The symptoms of heart illness, including arrhythmia, myocardia, heart failure, congenital heart disease, mitral regurgitation, and dilated cardiomyopathy, exhibit variation based on their specific nature.\nThe risk factors associated with heart disease include several aspects such as advanced age, genetic predisposition, tobacco use, physical behaviors, substance misuse, elevated cholesterol levels, hypertension, sedentary lifestyle, obesity, diabetes, psychological stress, and inadequate hygiene practices10. The gravity of cardiovascular disease mandates the implementation of a screening protocol for its diagnosis. In the screening procedure, medical professionals provide many diagnostic tests, including blood glucose level testing, cholesterol testing, blood pressure measurement, electrocardiography (ECG), ultrasound imaging, cardiac computer tomography (CT), calcium scoring, and stress testing. The screening procedure requires significant time-consuming manual tasks and human involvement.\nThe primary contributions of the research are listed below:\n-\nUsing the GA and RFEM in advanced feature selection guarantees identifying the most relevant features, reducing interference and augmenting the model’s predictive capability.\n-\nUsing feature extraction methodologies extends beyond merely selecting raw attributes, converting the data into a more comprehensive and informative representation. This process enhances the input for later analysis.\n-\nUSCOM techniques tackle the prevalent issue of uneven data distribution, enhancing the model’s capacity to generalize well across different classes.\n-\nUsing a MLDCNN in classification exploits the ability of deep learning to capture detailed patterns present in complicated databases effectively, improving the model’s prediction performance.\n-\nThe AEHOM facilitates the refinement of the model’s parameters, enhancing its performance and promoting effective convergence during training.\nThe following sections are arranged in the given manner: “Background and literature survey”aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the backdrop around heart disease prediction and thoroughly examine pertinent previous research conducted in this field. “Proposed heart disease prediction system” describes the unique machine learning-based heart disease prediction method (ML-HDPM) approach, which integrates feature selection, feature extraction, UAO, MLDCNN, and AEHOM techniques to achieve precise prediction. “Simulation analysis and findings” presents and analyzes the numerical results, emphasizing the better effectiveness of the ML-HDPM model in predicting heart disease. “Conclusions” provides a concise overview of the obtained results, examines their ramifications, and delineates potential directions for future investigations and improvements within the domain.\nBackground and literature survey\nCardiovascular disorders have been widely acknowledged as one of the primary contributors to mortality. Several research investigations have been conducted to examine the use of predictive models in forecasting indicators associated with the likelihood of developing cardiac disorders based on health data found in the existing literature. The latest advancements in machine learning tools and algorithms have stimulated research efforts in creating methodologies and techniques for detecting cardiac disease. Numerous methods have been explored to address this issue, including classification, clustering, etc.\nThe work conducted by Abdullatif et al. introduces a novel approach that combines supervised infinite feature selection with an enhanced weighted random forest algorithm to detect heart disease11. The process is selected to improve the significance of features and the model’s accuracy. The simulation results show significant improvement, achieving an accuracy rate of 92.14%, a sensitivity rate of 92.50%, and a specificity rate of 91.78%. This methodology presents an enhanced approach for detecting cardiac illness, potentially increasing patients’ survival rates.\nMuhammad et al. propose a sophisticated computer model to identify cardiac illness precisely12. The solution being presented utilizes machine learning methods to get accurate diagnoses. The model demonstrates favorable results, achieving an accuracy rate of 92.42%, a sensitivity rate of 92.40%, and a specificity rate of 92.44%. This work showcases the capacity of intelligent computational models to diagnose cardiac disease with precision and efficiency.\nArnaout et al. provide a novel approach, including using an ensemble of neural networks for the accurate prenatal detection of complicated congenital heart disease13. The use of neural networks in this approach enables precise diagnostic outcomes. The ensemble exhibits exceptional performance, attaining an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve value of 0.98. The research emphasizes the possibility of using neural network ensembles to identify fetal cardiac disease.\nThe study conducted by Alkhodari et al. centers on diagnosing valvular heart disease using convolutional and recurrent neural networks (CNNs and RNNs) applied to phonocardiogram recordings14. The selection of CNNs and RNNs is appropriate for data organized in sequences. The findings exhibit a noteworthy outcome, showcasing an overarching precision rate of 95.86%. This underscores the effectiveness of using deep learning techniques in the realm of diagnosing valvular heart disease.\nThe heart disease diagnosis approach using machine learning classification in the field of e-healthcare is proposed by Li et al.15. The research utilizes a range of classification techniques to enhance the precision of identification. The Random Forest classifier has notable performance, with an accuracy rate of 90.47%, a precision value of 0.909, and a recall value of 0.912. This method places significant emphasis on using machine learning techniques within the field of e-healthcare, specifically to accurately identify cases of heart disease.\nDixit et al. demonstrated the use of a cost-effective and portable ECG sensor for the early identification of cardiovascular disease16. Their suggested solution utilizes machine learning algorithms to process ECG data. The system encompasses several characteristics, such as capturing, preprocessing, and categorizing ECG signals. The simulation findings demonstrate a high level of accuracy, namely 95.2%, in diagnosing cardiac illnesses. This highlights the potential for using a low-cost ECG sensor as an effective means of early detection.\nAlsafi et al. introduced a sophisticated machine-learning system to diagnose coronary heart disease17. The presented approach utilizes machine learning methodologies to examine patient data, effectively using their characteristics for precise diagnoses. The simulation results demonstrate a notable level of precision, with an accuracy rate of 97.4%. This highlights their methodology’s potential to improve coronary heart disease diagnosis.\nAli et al. provided a novel healthcare monitoring system to anticipate cardiac disease18. The proposed method employs ensemble deep learning and feature fusion techniques to analyze patient data. The technique’s effectiveness is shown by its ability to achieve a prediction accuracy of 92.34% in the context of heart disease, highlighting the promise of ensemble deep learning as a reliable approach for monitoring healthcare.\nGárate-Escamila et al. focused on predicting heart disease using classification models, feature selection techniques, and principal component analysis (PCA)19. The suggested methodology emphasizes the importance of feature selection and dimensionality reduction. The simulation findings demonstrate a competitive level of performance, as shown by an accuracy rate of 87.5% obtained via the use of PCA. This outcome highlights the promising capabilities of these approaches in the realm of heart disease prediction.\nSonawane et al. proposed a heart disease prediction model that integrates data and ECG signals using a hybrid clustering approach20. The proposed method combines clustering methodologies with machine learning algorithms to achieve precise prediction. The suggested method achieves a classification accuracy of 92.6%, offering the possibility of using hybrid clustering techniques to enhance the prediction of cardiac illness by integrating both traditional data and ECG signals.\nThe literature review elucidates many methodologies for diagnosing and predicting heart illness, including advanced machine learning, deep learning, and sensor-based data-collecting strategies. Although these methodologies provide encouraging outcomes, several limitations arise, such as inconsistent diagnostic precision and possible issues related to overfitting. The suggested methods effectively tackle these issues by incorporating cutting-edge technology and feature selection procedures, augmenting the accuracy and dependability of heart disease diagnosis and prognosis.\nProposed heart disease prediction system\nThe research endeavors to establish a comprehensive framework for achieving precise heart disease prediction, employing a multifaceted approach that integrates advanced machine learning methodologies, feature selection, and dimensionality reduction techniques. By harnessing sophisticated machine learning algorithms, the model adeptly discerns intricate patterns embedded within patient data, utilizing ensemble deep learning and innovative feature fusion strategies. This holistic strategy ensures the accurate and timely prognosis of cardiac disease, furnishing healthcare practitioners with a valuable tool to enhance patient treatment outcomes.\nMoreover, the hybrid system encompasses three pivotal stages: data gathering, pre-processing, and classification, each playing pivotal roles in refining the predictive model. During the meticulous pre-processing phase, a series of tasks are meticulously executed to uphold data integrity and model efficacy. These tasks encompass the meticulous imputation of missing data, wherein the ML-HDPM method is proficiently utilized to accurately estimate absent values within the database. Furthermore, exhaustive feature selection endeavors are undertaken to pinpoint the most pertinent attributes for predictive modeling. This process is facilitated by a hybrid technique that synergistically amalgamates the capabilities of genetic algorithm (GA) and recursive feature elimination method (RFEM), facilitating the identification of informative features crucial for precise predictions.\nAdditionally, to ensure uniformity in the impact of features, a conventional scalar approach is employed to recalibrate the coefficients of all features, aligning their means to 0 and standard deviations to 1, thereby mitigating potential biases stemming from feature scale discrepancies. Within the database, classification is facilitated by delineating between two distinct classes: class 0 and class 1, representing the absence and presence of heart disease, respectively. Specifically, 164 cases are attributed to class 0, indicative of the absence of heart disease, while 139 instances are categorized as class 1, denoting the presence of heart disease. To mitigate the inherent class imbalance, the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) is deployed, ensuring equitable representation of both classes and bolstering the model’s predictive prowess across diverse scenarios.\nImplementation of the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) within the research framework entails a systematic approach to redress the inherent class imbalance between class 0 (indicating the absence of heart disease) and class 1 (signifying the presence of heart disease). SMOTE functions by generating synthetic samples from the minority class, thereby augmenting its representation within the dataset. This technique involves selecting individual instances from the minority class and creating synthetic instances along the line segments connecting them to their nearest neighbors. By interpolating between existing instances, SMOTE effectively enhances the diversity of the minority class without introducing biases, thus fostering a balanced representation of both classes. This approach fortifies the model’s predictive capabilities, ensuring robust performance across a myriad of scenarios and enhancing its utility in clinical practice.\nSpecifically, SMOTE facilitates equitable representation of both classes, enabling the model to learn from a more diverse range of examples and effectively capture the underlying patterns and nuances associated with both the presence and absence of heart disease. As a result, the predictive model becomes more adept at accurately discerning between cases of heart disease and non-heart disease, thereby enhancing its diagnostic precision and reliability. Additionally, by mitigating the impact of class imbalance, SMOTE contributes to the model’s generalizability and robustness, ensuring consistent performance across diverse patient populations and clinical settings. Overall, the integration of SMOTE into the proposed model significantly enhances its predictive capabilities, ultimately empowering healthcare practitioners with a more effective tool for accurate heart disease diagnosis and prognosis.\nThe methodology generates artificial instances of underrepresented categories, achieving a balanced distribution across both types. The process of classification involves the use of chosen characteristics and using various classifiers such as support vector machine (SVM)21, PCA22, linear discriminant analysis (LDA)23, naïve Bayes (NB)24, decision tree (DT)25, and random forest (RF)26. Ultimately, the classifier predicts an individual’s presence or absence of heart disease. The mechanism used in the suggested approach for heart disease forecasting is shown in Fig. 1.\nPre-processing\nThis first phase is the primary step of the diagnostic procedure. The process consists of three stages: substituting absent qualities, eliminating duplications, and segregation. A characteristic’s missing value is substituted after a comprehensive examination of the patient’s age category, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure levels. If the majority of attribute values of a patient exhibit similarity, the corresponding value is replaced in the same spot. The redundancy reduction process aims to decrease the quantity of data by eliminating redundant or useless qualities. The patients are categorized according to the specific form of chest pain they exhibit, namely: (1) classic angina, (2) atypical angina, (3) non-anginal suffering, and (4) asymptomatic suffering.\nFeature selection\nThe GA is founded on the principles of natural selection. The algorithm produces many solutions within a single generation. Each solution is referred to as a genome. The aggregate of solutions within a single generation is often called the population. The algorithm undergoes several iterations across generations to provide an improved result. During each process iteration, genetic algorithms are used on genomes derived from previous generations to generate the generation. Selection, crossovers, and mutations are genetic operators often used in genetic algorithms.\nThe selection agent is responsible for choosing the most optimal people from every age group. A fitness function assesses each person’s fitness level about others within the general population. The genomes that a selection agent chooses are then put into the mating pool, contributing to the formation of the following generation. The crossover agent is a genetic algorithm technique that combines individuals from mating pools to generate improved offspring for generations. Various crossover agents exist, including single-point, two-point, and multipoint crossover. If a mixture is not introduced into the general population, individuals in the following generation will likely exhibit similarities to the preceding population. The variety is presented using a mutation manager, which introduces random alterations to the individuals. The process of the genetic algorithm’s development is shown in Fig. 2.\nA total of 18 iterations have been used. A total of 80 genomes were chosen in every successive generation. A total of 40 optimal genomes were selected at each age and then transmitted to the next generation. A total of 40 genomes were picked randomly. A crossover rate of 5% and a mutation rate 0.05 were used. The user’s data is negated. The fitness of the genomes was determined by using the mean square error of the genome as the objective function. The RFEM method is an iterative process that recursively eliminates unnecessary characteristics. The classifier undergoes training using the provided training data, and afterward, the significance of the features is determined by calculation. The least influential elements are eliminated during each process iteration, and the model is retrained using the remaining subset of features. The procedures are executed iteratively until the necessary quantity of features is attained. The method receives the number of characteristics to be maintained as a parameter. The functionality of the RFEM method is shown in Fig. 3.\nHeart feature extraction\nThe investigation involves the extraction of diverse attributes from the medical data obtained via healthcare devices. The database comprises several physiological measurements, including heart rate, arterial pressure, and blood sugar level. To accurately determine the presence of cardiac disease, it is essential to extract critical characteristics, including statistical and temporal aspects. The equations provided below constitute the list of feature extraction.\nThe maximum voltage, total harmonic distortion (THD), heart rate, zero crossing rate (ZCR), entropy (ent), energy (eg), and standard deviation (SD) are expressed in Eqs. (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7).\nThe voltage is denoted V, the harmonic component is denoted HC, the probability of frequency filter is denoted \\({P}_{ff}\\), the signal change and signal no change are expressed \\({S}_{c} {\\text{and}} {S}_{nc}\\). The probability is expressed \\({P}_{xy}\\), and the deviation is denoted k. The collected data contains an interval referred to as RR. The variation is expressed in Eq. (8).\nThe variable M represents the aggregate count of RR intervals in the database. The root mean square of the sum of the consecutive differences is expressed in Eq. (9).\n\\({RR}_{x}\\) refers to the integrated heartbeat, k represents the mean value, and \\({P}_{xy}\\) signifies the probability value. The qualities have been derived from the medical gadget data. The retrieved properties are retained as factors to forecast heart disease and alterations in the heart pattern. The ensuing section explains the intricate procedure involved in identifying heart disease.\nCluster-based over-sampled method\nA novel approach has been devised using resampling and grouping methodologies to handle unbalanced stroke data. Resampling techniques include both under sampling and oversampling methods. Under sampling is a technique to remove data points from the majority class specimens selectively. Oversampling is used to augment the representation of minority specimens. Grouping is the process of grouping data so that models within each group exhibit similar qualities.\nFigure 4 illustrates the primary operations inside the system that has been developed. The method performs an under sampling function on collecting specimens with majority labels. Clustering is performed on the subset of minority labels within the overall data set. The example set generated by the underestimating procedure is separated into distinct testing, training, and validation sets. This division is done according to the ratio of 8:1:1. The acquired training sets have been combined. The validation sets, and testing sets have been completed. Next, the SMOTE algorithm performs oversampling on the specimens with minority labels inside the merged training set, resulting in the acquisition of the final stage of training data27. In the concluding training set, the quantity of positive tests is about equivalent to the number of negative specimens, and each category of positive model is comprised. This training database offers an abundant number of examples that are used for the training of machine learning algorithms to extract characteristics. The method generates balanced activity, verification, and testing sets.\nFigure 5 illustrates the UCOM process for heart disease prediction. The UCOM algorithm is comprised of three distinct parts. The number of individuals without heart attacks is much larger than those without, so the data set of individuals without heart attacks is underrepresented. The random underestimating procedure resulted in the selection of specimen number 120. The prediction outcome achieved with a specimen count of 120 demonstrates superior performance. A clustering operation is performed on the specimens associated with heart attacks to ensure the inclusion of distinct characteristics from each subgroup of close-distance data throughout the training process. To get a balanced distribution of specimens with and without heart attacks throughout the training, oversampling is used for the models with heart attacks.\n-\n(1) The use of under sampling techniques to the majority class of negative specimens, namely those about stroke without heart attack cases. Most specimens, namely those without heart attack but with stroke, were picked randomly to create three subsets: a training subset, a validation subset, and a testing subset. The UCOM technique incorporates the parameter of randomized pick specimens, which depends on the data collection characteristics and the specimen set representing the minority label. The ratio of models with a heart attack to specimens without cardiac attack in the MIMIC-III database is 2:3, indicating an under sampling percentage28. In the MIMIC-III database, the stroke specimens database entails randomly selecting two-thirds of the stroke specimens, excluding those that include heart attacks.\n-\n(2) Clustering the specimen set consisting of minority labels, namely stroke and heart attack data, is being performed.\nThe research used a clustering algorithm to aggregate minority specimens, namely stroke specimens with cardiac arrest, into several clusters. Next, divide each group into three sets: the set for training, validation, and testing set. This division should be done by the ratio 8:1:1. The number of K is obtained by calculating the mean square error. The computation of the Sum of Squared Errors (SSE) is represented by Eq. (10).\n$$E=\\sum_{i=0}^{{C}_{x}}{\\left|i-{m}_{x}\\right|}^{2}$$(10)\\({C}_{x}\\) represents the x-th cluster, \\(i\\) denotes the specimen inside \\({C}_{x}\\), and \\({m}_{x}\\) refers to the centroid of \\({C}_{x}\\)\n-\n(3) The process of dividing and combining clusters.\nThe underspecified specimens and each cluster are divided into training, validation, and testing sets using an 8:1:1 ratio. These sets are combined to create a new activity, validation, and testing set. The three newly introduced groups consist of training, verification, and testing sets.\n-\n(4) One approach to address the class imbalance in the training set is to use the SMOTE to specimen the pseudo training set.\nSMOTE method is a sampling technique designed to address imbalanced databases by generating synthetic specimens for the minority class. The method exhibits enhancements above the random sampling approach. The pseudo training set should be inputted into the SMOTE algorithm. The method employs a random selection process to choose specimens with a minority label and then identifies the closest neighbors. The system produces additional models with the minority label inside the set of centering specimens and their corresponding neighbour’s. The algorithm continues its execution until the count of samples with the minority label equals the count of models with the majority label. At this point, it produces the updated training set.\nClassification method\nThe MLDCNN is a deep-learning neural network that utilizes the AEHOM for weight value optimization. Following the process of feature selection, the selected features are subjected to classification using the MLDCNN. The MLDCNN classifier receives each chosen component as its input in this context. The weights are arbitrarily given values associated with each piece of information. The concealed nodes inside the succeeding concealed layer compute the sum of the input value multiplied by the weight vector associated with all the input nodes connected to it. Random weight values have been shown to enhance the efficacy of the backpropagation process in obtaining the desired outcome. The optimization process is conducted in this manner. The activation procedure is then used, and the output of this layer is sent to the subsequent layer. The weights have a significant impact on the work of the classifier. The classification process in the MLDCNN involves a series of algorithmic phases, outlined as follows.\nStep 1: Eqs. (11), (12) represent the feature values and their corresponding weights.\nThe symbol \\({F}_{x}\\) represents the input value, which represents a selection of n features denoted as \\({F}_{1},{F}_{2},\\cdots ,{F}_{m}\\). Similarly, \\({W}_{x}\\) represents the weight value of \\({F}_{x}\\), which shows the appropriate weights for the n features as \\({W}_{1},{W}_{2},\\cdots ,{W}_{m}\\).\nStep 2: The inputs are multiplied by weight vectors that have been randomly selected, and the resulting products are then summed using Eq. (13).\nThe input and the weight are denoted \\(F, and W\\). \\(M\\) represents the aggregate value.\nStep 3: The objective is to ascertain that the activation function is expressed in Eq. (14) and the classification function is expressed in Eq. (15).\nThe symbol \\({A}_{{f}_{x}}\\) represents the activation operation, whereas \\({C}_{x}\\) represents the exponential of \\({F}_{x}\\). The suggested system employs a Gaussian function as a kind of activation function.\nStep 4: Assess the hidden layer output using a rigorous evaluation using Eq. (16).\nThe bias value is denoted as \\({B}_{x}\\), whereas the weight across the hidden input and layers is specified as \\({W}_{x}\\). The classification function is denoted \\({C}_{x}\\).\nStep 5: The three processes above are executed for every layer inside the MLDCNN. The output unit is assessed by aggregating the weights of every input signal to get the values of the neurons in the layer that produces signals expressed in Eq. (17).\nThe variable \\({O}_{x}\\) represents the value of the level that comes before the resultant layer, \\({W}_{x}\\) identifies the layer weights concealed, and \\({R}_{x}\\) denotes the measurement unit of the output.\nStep 6: This stage involves the comparison of the output generated by the network with the desired target value. The disparity between these two quantities is often called the error signal. The mathematical expression for this disparity is expressed in Eq. (18).\nThe error indication, denoted as \\({E}_{x}\\), represents the discrepancy between the actual and desired output, specified by \\({D}_{x}\\). In this step, a comparison is made between the value of the output metric and the goal value. The associated mistake is identified. The error at the output is sent back to all other devices in the network by computing a value \\({k}_{x}\\) according to this mistake, denoted in Eq. (19).\nHeart rate is denoted \\({R}_{x}\\), and the error disparity is expressed \\({E}_{x}\\).\nStep 7: The use of the backpropagation technique achieves the weight adjustment. The provided relation is presented in Eq. (20).\nThe weight adjustment is denoted by \\({W}_{{c}_{x}}\\), the momentum is represented by \\(\\alpha\\), and \\({k}_{x}\\) refers to the mistake dispersed throughout the network. The weight values are adjusted using the AEHOM technique.\nAEHOM\nThe AEHOM framework is based on the notion that the elephant population is divided into several clans. Each clan has a distinct quantity of elephants. Typically, male elephants separate from their clans and choose a solitary lifestyle. The leadership of each clan is entrusted to the oldest female elephant, commonly called the matriarch. In a herd of elephants, the matriarchs are known to choose the most favorable option, whereas the male elephants’ attitude indicates the least favorable alternative. The elephant population is divided into several clans. Every individual, denoted as v, belonging to a particular family, indicated as c, is directed by the matriarch, denoted as \\({E}_{n}\\), who has the most significant fitness value within the given generation. The procedure above is represented by Eq. (21).\n\\({P}_{x+1,{E}_{n,v}}\\) denotes the updated position of the variable u in the context of the algorithm c. \\({P}_{x,{E}_{n}}\\) reflects the prior location of u, while \\({P}_{{E}_{n,v}}\\) signifies the optimal solution of \\({E}_{n,v}\\). The variable c, which belongs to the interval [0, 1], determines the impact of the matriarch in the procedure. \\({R}_{D}\\) is a random number employed to enhance population diversity during the method's later phases. The optimal location of the elephant inside clan \\({P}_{x+1,{E}_{n,v}}\\) is revised via Eq. (22).\nThe symbol l represents a parameter within the range of [0, 1]. This variable significantly determines how \\({P}_{c,{E}_{n}}\\) influences the overall outcome, as shown in Eq. (23).\nThe variable \\({b}_{{E}_{n},y,l}\\) represents the yth dimension, where l is more than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to L. The variable L represents the total width of the space. \\(V{E}_{n}\\) symbolizes the number of elephants in clan c.\nMale elephants that separate from their social group are used to conduct exploratory activities. A subset of elephants exhibiting the lowest fitness values within each clan is assigned new locations, as Eq. (24) shows\nThe variables are defined as follows: \\({P}_{min}\\) represents the lower limit of the searching space. \\({P}_{max}\\) represents the upper bound of the searching area. The variable k is constrained to the interval [0, 1]. A stochastic variable generated from a uniform probability distribution.\nAfter evaluating the placements of the elephants, mutation and crossing procedures are implemented to enhance the optimization process. The use of a two-point crossover is implemented. This approach involves the selection of two sites on the parental genome. The genetic material between these two specific locations undergoes reciprocal exchange between the parent’s genomes, resulting in the acquisition of the offspring’s genome. These points are evaluated in Eqs. (25) and (26).\nThe mutation process (\\({P}_{x+1,{E}_{n}}\\)) entails exchanging a certain number of genes from each genome with novel genes. The exchanged genes refer to the genetically modified genes intentionally introduced into the genome without duplication. The procedure is iteratively executed until a solution exhibiting a higher fitness level is achieved.\nThe presented technique incorporates a comprehensive approach to predicting cardiac disease, which involves feature selection, data preparation, and machine learning algorithms. The data about patients is extracted and processed, resulting in the identification of valuable aspects. These characteristics are used in advanced machine learning methods, such as ensemble deep learning and classification methodologies. This merger aims to enhance precision and expedite the prognosis of cardiac disease with accuracy.\nSimulation analysis and findings\nThe performance of the suggested strategy is evaluated via thorough testing in the simulation part. Multiple metrics, including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision, are calculated to assess the predictive efficacy of the methodology. The effectiveness of the suggested strategy is validated by a comparative study conducted against current models.\nDatabases\nThe UCI machine learning database, comprising four databases including the Cleveland database29, the Hungary database30, the Switzerland database31, and the Long Beach database, was utilized to gather data on heart illness32. Specifically, the Cleveland database was selected for this study due to its widespread use among machine learning researchers and its provision of comprehensive information. With a total of 303 entries, the Cleveland database originally contained 76 characteristics, although the dataset available in the repository includes information for only a subset of 14 features. Sourced primarily from the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, the Cleveland database serves as the primary data source for this study. The prediction of heart disease involves the consideration of 13 qualities, with one attribute serving as the output or anticipated attribute indicating the existence of heart disease in a patient.\nNotably, the database from Cleveland includes a feature called “num,” which represents the finding of heart disease in individuals on a scale ranging from 0 to 4. A numerical value of 0 signifies the absence of heart illness, while values from 1 to 4 denote individuals afflicted with heart disease, with the scale indicating the degree of severity (with four being the most severe). Additionally, the study employed a modified bee method and k-fold cross-validation for robust analysis.\nExperimental setup for evaluation\nThe tests were conducted based on specific parameters and methodologies, including: (1) conducting the study using the entire database without employing any data-reducing methods, (2) experimenting with a reduced database by selecting a subset of the original data, and (3) experimenting with a modified bee method on the reduced database. The modified bee method, an adaptation of the traditional bee algorithm for optimization, was specifically tailored to enhance performance within the context of the study by iteratively exploring and optimizing parameters. These tests were executed on a system setup comprising an i5 CPU with 3 GB of RAM, utilizing the MATLAB 9.2 program for model construction. In each experiment, the data in the database was utilized to train and test the model, with different subsets or modifications applied as per the experimental conditions. Additionally, the study employed k-fold cross-validation, where the dataset was divided into k subsets, with each subset used as a testing set while the remaining data served as training sets. This process was repeated k times, and the performance metric computed the mean value over ‘k’ iterations to ensure robust evaluation of the model’s performance under varying conditions.\nSimulation results\nThe simulation results of the proposed method are analyzed, and the results are compared with the existing models.\nThe accuracy analysis depicted in Fig. 6 showcases the effectiveness of the machine learning hybrid deep predictive model (ML-HDPM) approach in predicting heart disease. Compared to other algorithms, ML-HDPM achieves notably higher training accuracy (95.5%) and testing accuracy (89.1%). This significant improvement is attributed to the integration of various advanced methodologies within the model. Firstly, ML-HDPM employs sophisticated feature selection techniques to identify the most relevant attributes related to cardiovascular health, thereby enabling the model to discern subtle patterns indicative of heart disease. Additionally, the utilization of data balancing techniques ensures that the model is trained on a representative sample of both positive and negative instances, leading to more accurate predictions. Furthermore, the incorporation of deep learning capabilities through the MLDCNN architecture allows the model to automatically learn intricate patterns and relationships within the data, further enhancing its predictive accuracy. Lastly, optimization using the adaptive elephant herding optimization methodology (AEHOM) fine-tunes the model parameters and weights, resulting in improved accuracy. Overall, the synergistic integration of these methodologies enables ML-HDPM to accurately predict heart disease, thus demonstrating its potential to enhance clinical decision-making and patient care.\nFigure 7 illustrates the precision analysis of heart disease prediction, showcasing the performance of the machine learning hybrid deep predictive model (ML-HDPM) technique. Notably, ML-HDPM achieves higher precision rates in both training (94.8%) and testing (88.3%) phases compared to alternative algorithms. This success can be attributed to the holistic approach adopted by ML-HDPM, which integrates several key methodologies. Firstly, the model employs advanced feature selection techniques to identify relevant attributes critical for accurate heart disease prediction. Additionally, ML-HDPM addresses data imbalances through effective data balancing methods, ensuring that the model is trained on a representative dataset. Moreover, the integration of deep learning capabilities using the MLDCNN architecture, enhanced by AEHOM optimization, further contributes to the model’s precision. By adeptly managing feature relevance and addressing data imbalances, ML-HDPM demonstrates enhanced accuracy in detecting heart disease patterns. These results underscore the importance of the proposed methodology in accurately diagnosing cardiac diseases, thus highlighting its significance in clinical decision-making and ultimately improving patient outcomes.\nFigure 8 depicts the false positive rate (FPR) analysis of various methods for predicting heart disease, with the machine learning hybrid deep predictive model (ML-HDPM) technique exhibiting notably lower FPR values during both training (8.2%) and testing (14.7%) phases compared to alternative methods. This accomplishment can be attributed to the synergistic utilization of feature selection, data balancing, and enhanced deep learning components within the ML-HDPM framework. By employing these strategies, the model enhances its capability to accurately identify instances that do not have heart disease, thereby reducing the number of cases falsely identified as positive. Consequently, the suggested approach demonstrates efficacy in minimizing misclassification errors, a crucial aspect for achieving precise predictions of cardiac diseases and ultimately improving patient care outcomes.\nFigure 9 illustrates the true positive rate (TPR) analysis across various algorithms for predicting heart disease, highlighting the machine learning hybrid deep predictive model (ML-HDPM) technique’s superior performance. During both training and testing phases, ML-HDPM achieves notably higher TPR values, with 96.2% and 90.8%, respectively. This success can be attributed to the comprehensive methodology employed by ML-HDPM, which encompasses the identification of relevant features, data balancing, and optimization of deep learning techniques. By leveraging these strategies, ML-HDPM effectively utilizes its feature-rich and balanced database to accurately detect true positives, resulting in an enhanced TPR. These results underscore the potential of ML-HDPM in bolstering the prediction of heart disease, thereby facilitating more precise diagnoses and ultimately leading to better patient outcomes.\nThe ML-HDPM technique has superior performance in terms of F-scores, achieving better scores in both training (91.5%) and testing (89.6%) compared to other algorithms. The F score results of the different models are expressed in Fig. 10. The success of this accomplishment is ascribed to the comprehensive nature of the methodology, which integrates feature selection, data balance, and deep learning optimization techniques. ML-HDPM successfully captures meaningful patterns in heart disease data, resulting in higher F-scores by establishing a balance between accuracy and recall. The results highlight the potential of ML-HDPM in accurately predicting heart disease, hence improving the whole diagnostic process and patient treatment.\nThe simulation findings presented in the study highlight the effectiveness of the machine learning hybrid deep predictive model (ML-HDPM) approach in accurately predicting heart disease. With a training accuracy of 95.5% and a testing accuracy of 89.1%, ML-HDPM outperforms other algorithms, demonstrating its exceptional performance in both sets. This superiority is further supported by the accuracy values of 94.8% for training and 88.3% for testing, underscoring the model’s effectiveness across different datasets expressed in Fig. 11. Moreover, ML-HDPM showcases a significant reduction in false positive rates (FPR), with rates of 8.2% during training and 14.7% during testing. This reduction in FPR is crucial as it indicates ML-HDPM’s ability to minimize misclassification errors, thereby improving the accuracy of heart disease prediction. Additionally, ML-HDPM exhibits higher true positive rates (TPR) compared to other algorithms, with rates of 96.2% during training and 90.8% during testing. These higher TPR values reflect ML-HDPM’s capability to accurately detect positive instances of heart disease, contributing to more reliable diagnostic outcomes.\nFurthermore, ML-HDPM achieves balanced F-scores of 91.5% during training and 89.6% during testing, indicating a harmonious blend of precision and recall in its predictions. This balance is crucial for ensuring accurate and reliable heart disease prediction. Regarding specificity, ML-HDPM demonstrates superior performance, with specificity rates of 89.7% in training and 84.2% in testing, surpassing other algorithms. This notable difference in specificity can be attributed to the comprehensive methodology employed by ML-HDPM, which integrates feature selection, data balance, and deep learning optimization techniques. By effectively reducing false positive rates and properly recognizing real negatives, ML-HDPM enhances the precision of heart disease diagnoses, thereby improving patient care outcomes.\nIn summary, the considerable differences observed among the obtained results, particularly in terms of accuracy, false positive rates, true positive rates, F-scores, and specificity, highlight the superior performance of the ML-HDPM approach in predicting heart disease. The comprehensive methodology and integrated techniques utilized by ML-HDPM contribute to its effectiveness in improving accuracy, reducing misclassification errors, and enhancing diagnostic reliability, ultimately leading to better patient care outcomes.\nConclusions\nThe research presents a comprehensive approach, ML-HDPM, aimed at enhancing the prediction of cardiovascular disease by addressing the limitations of traditional diagnostic methods. This approach combines various techniques such as feature selection, data balancing, and deep learning, utilizing the MLDCNN model improved with AEHOM.\nThe results of the study demonstrate promising performance metrics, with high training and testing accuracies, as well as precision rates. The approach also shows improvements in both false positive rates and true positive rates, indicating its potential for accurate prediction while minimizing false alarms. Additionally, the balanced F-scores suggest that the methodology maintains a good balance between precision and recall. These findings suggest that ML-HDPM has the potential to significantly improve the precision of diagnostic assessments for cardiovascular disease, thereby assisting healthcare professionals in making timely and accurate clinical decisions. However, the research also acknowledges the need for further exploration and refinement of the methodology, particularly regarding challenges related to data quality, feature selection, and optimization techniques. Future investigations should aim to expand the scope of inquiry to encompass a broader range of cardiovascular conditions and explore the practical implementation of the findings in real-world healthcare settings. Overall, the study underscores the transformative impact of advanced machine learning methodologies in improving the prediction and management of cardiovascular disease.\nData availability\nThe data presented in this study are available upon request from the corresponding author.\nCode availability\nThe custom code used in this study is openly available and can be accessed via https://github.com/prabukiwi1/Heart-Disease-Diagnosis.

Recognizing the rapid advancement of AI technologies and their potential to transform healthcare delivery, we propose a set of guidelines emphasizing fairness, robustness, privacy, safety, transparency, explainability, accountability, and benefit. Through a multidisciplinary collaboration, we developed and operationalized these guidelines within a healthcare system, highlighting a case study on ambient documentation to demonstrate the practical application and challenges of implementing generative AI in clinical environments. Our proposed framework ensures continuous monitoring, evaluation, and adaptation of AI technologies, addressing ethical considerations and enhancing patient care. This work contributes to the discourse on responsible AI use in healthcare, offering a blueprint for institutions to navigate the complexities of AI integration responsibly and effectively, thus promoting better, more equitable healthcare outcomes.\nSimilar content being viewed by others\nIntroduction\nThe integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into medicine has advanced markedly, initially making significant strides in medical imaging domains such as radiology, dermatology, pathology, and gastroenterology1. Deep learning models have shown remarkable capabilities, from detecting malignant breast lesions in X-rays2 to identifying diabetic retinopathy in fundus imaging3 and lung nodules in computed tomography scans4, among other applications. Beyond imaging, these models show promise in enhancing clinical decision-making, providing treatment recommendations, and facilitating patient triage5,6,7.\nThe advent of large language models (LLMs) has further expanded AI’s potential in healthcare, showing the potential to improve tasks such as history taking, patient summarization, generation of discharge summaries, procedural coding, and even provision of diagnostic recommendations8.\nAs with other healthcare technologies—such as electronic health records, clinical decision support, and telemedicine—large language models necessitate scrutiny, validation, and ongoing safety monitoring. Beyond past considerations such as usability, patient privacy, workflow adaptation, and training procedures9, AI presents a new set of challenges, such as variability in model performance across different healthcare settings due to out-of-distribution shifts, performance changes over time due to evolving disease prevalence, changes in patient demographics, and the introduction of new medical technologies10,11. LLMs, in particular, face heightened scrutiny over their capacity to generate inaccurate or irrelevant content, the risk of fabricating non-existent information (hallucinations), omitting crucial details in the documentation, and navigating data privacy intricacies during training phases12,13.\nIn response to these rapid developments, regulatory bodies like the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have begun to adapt quickly. However, clear benchmarks for assessing AI models and monitoring their performance over time remain elusive. Leading entities, including the Office of the National Coordinator14, the White House’s AI Bill of Rights blueprint15,16, the Coalition for Health AI (CHAI)17, the World Health Organization18, corporations such as Microsoft19, and professional associations like the American Medical Association20, have begun to establish high-level guidelines. These guidelines emphasize transparency, accountability, equity, privacy, security, safety, reliability, and robustness in AI applications. Despite these efforts, a tangible gap exists in the practical implementation of these guidelines and ongoing oversight of AI within healthcare settings.\nTo bridge this gap, we have developed a comprehensive set of guidelines that encompasses the entire range of AI systems within healthcare, ranging from traditional machine learning models to advanced generative AI technologies. By presenting a detailed case study on the application of this framework to ambient documentation, we emphasize the practicality and immediate relevance of our methodology. Our goal is to provide a foundational blueprint for healthcare institutions, ensuring AI is integrated responsibly and effectively across the healthcare sector.\nMethods\nCrafting guidelines for AI integration in healthcare settings\nWe brought together a cross-functional team of 18 people from our integrated academic healthcare system, including leaders from informatics, legal, research, data analytics, privacy, patient experience, equity, quality, and safety. We first identified critical themes through a peer-reviewed and gray literature search using terms like “AI governance in healthcare”, “AI guidelines/implementations”. Based on this search and our expert consensus approach (using Delphi-like methodology), we focused on nine principles: (1) Fairness, (2) Equity, (3) Robustness, (4) Privacy, (5) Safety, (6) Transparency, (7) Explainability, (8) Accountability, and (9) Benefit (summarized in Table 1). Additionally, recognizing the importance of collaboration across healthcare organizations for AI assurance to ensure AI ethics are upheld collectively, avoiding duplication of efforts, and enhancing AI implementation quality, we worked with other healthcare institutions and participated in industry collaborations.\nTo delve further into specifics, we established three focused groups to refine our guidelines: (1) Fairness and Privacy; (2) Transparency, Accountability, and Benefit; and (3) Robustness and Safety, each group had 4, 7, and 5 expert members respectively These insights were integrated into official guidelines for AI governance, incorporating appropriate considerations across institutional stakeholders (Fig. 1).\nOperationalizing AI deployment guidelines\nFollowing the establishment of comprehensive AI integration guidelines, our focus shifted toward the development and execution of a structured framework to facilitate their application within the healthcare setting. This effort was co-led by the innovation, digital, and data science teams.\nOur AI deployment guidelines had to mirror these teams’ existing protocols yet also consider the unique considerations of AI technologies across the Mass General Brigham (MGB) system. We adapted the standard digital work intake and created a specialized technology assessment tool. Our standard intake process evaluates project alignment with organizational priorities and digital strategy, technical feasibility, resource requirements, and project leadership assignments. The specialized assessment tool was specifically designed to address the distinct aspects of AI applications, such as the datasets employed for training and validation, development methods, performance evaluation metrics, potential risks, limitations, and ongoing monitoring parameters.\nThe preliminary evaluation stage culminates in a consultative session with the respective vendor or research team. This meeting is pivotal, allowing for an in-depth discussion on the proposed metrics, the frequency and nature of model updates, monitoring and the formulation of a strategy for the subsequent shadow deployment phase. The shadow deployment phase allows the AI systems to operate parallel to existing workflows without impacting patient care, allowing for a real-time evaluation and optimization of the technology under actual working conditions.\nFollowing the shadow deployment, our evaluation of AI systems encompasses a range of key metrics, ensuring their efficacy and seamless integration into clinical settings. Among these metrics, we prioritize assessing fairness across patient demographics, collecting provider feedback to gauge user experience, and examining workflow integration and usability to assess scalability, cost-effectiveness, clinical impact, and performance stability over time. These metrics provide a framework for evaluating the AI systems’ effectiveness and practicality in real-world healthcare environments.\nResults\nEstablishing AI integration guidelines in healthcare: outcomes and principles\nThrough this process, we identified key components critical to responsible AI implementation, providing a more detailed analysis than what is available in existing frameworks. (Table 1; Sup 1) Upholding our commitment to fairness, we mandated diverse training datasets as a standard requirement to mitigate bias. Going further would be the evaluation of outcomes with an equity lens, and subsequent model reengineering to ensure equitable outcomes. Equally crucial is the transparent communication of systems’ FDA status, specifying whether FDA approval is required and, if so, its current approval status, to ensure compliance and foster trust.\nOur team is committed to actively monitoring AI systems, promptly addressing performance issues, and ensuring equity, robustness, and accountability. A risk-based approach should be taken to this monitoring, such that those applications that potentially introduce greater risk to care outcomes are monitored more robustly than those with minimal or no risk to clinical outcomes. An AI operations committee is being established to lead and provide oversight to this effort.\nOur aim is to maintain stringent documentation and transparent communication, enabling informed decision-making regarding AI tools in patient care. While autonomous AI enhances administrative efficiency, we currently enforce stringent human oversight in all clinical decision-making processes to help ensure patient safety. Our protocol also mandates intensified monitoring procedures to effectively navigate associated risks and uncertainties, especially for high-risk AI systems, including those utilizing LLMs.\nThe process of establishing these guidelines was not without challenges, as finding common meeting times for all leaders proved difficult. However, forming smaller, specialized groups proved beneficial, allowing leaders with relevant expertise to collaborate effectively. Ultimately, bringing the outcomes back to the larger team was essential, ensuring a unified approach across all departments.\nFramework for AI implementation in healthcare: a case study of ambient documentation\nIn our effort to establish a robust framework for AI implementation across all AI types, we selected generative AI, specifically its application in ambient documentation systems, as a representative case study to illustrate our approach. This choice was driven by the inherent monitoring challenges associated with generative AI technologies. Ambient documentation exemplifies an AI application that records conversations between patients and clinicians to generate draft clinical notes, which clinicians subsequently review and refine before finalizing the medical records.\nWe first implemented a pilot study involving a select group of individuals from various departments.\nIn prioritizing this organization-wide application, we focused on security and privacy, sharing deidentified data with the vendor to enable continuous model updates and improvements. We collaborated closely with the vendor on strict de-identification processes, data retention policies, and the controlled use of data solely for enhancing the model’s performance. Crucially, we prohibited long-term storage and use of recordings because the recordings cannot be de-identified, thereby safeguarding the privacy and security of both patients and clinicians.\nAs an integral component of our transparency and explainability framework, this initial phase allowed for an in-depth assessment of the system’s functionality and the collection of targeted feedback, crucial for identifying potential issues early in the implementation process. We employed a set of metrics for evaluation, including system usage, the percentage of notes retained after edits by clinicians to evaluate clinical impact, and feedback in both numeric and free-text formats to assess performance. These metrics were monitored over time to identify any discernible trends.\nTo ensure accountability, we require that all clinical messages generated by the system be reviewed and edited by clinicians before being sent to patients.\nWhile focusing on patient benefit, we acknowledge the inability to measure quality based on demographics—due to the lack of linkage between these data and electronic health records—our existing metrics have underscored the tool’s capability to be effectively utilized across the entire organization. Recognizing the diversity of our user base, we placed significant emphasis on testing the AI tool across a spectrum of users, including patients and providers, to ensure its robustness irrespective of one’s primary language, accent, or the presence of an interpreter during clinical visits. This testing approach led to the selection of vendors that demonstrated proficiency in drafting clinical visit notes in scenarios involving non-English languages and interpreters.\nDuring the shadow deployment, most users were from the Emergency Medicine and Internal Medicine Departments. There were no specific Feedback trends, but the average scores were mostly in the range of 3–5, with 5 being the best possible score. Most criticisms targeted the documentation of physical examinations, potentially reflecting the less intuitive nature of vocalizing physical exam findings in the presence of a patient compared to the more fluid process of recounting the history of the present illness, which received positive remarks. Furthermore, there were appreciative comments on the system’s efficiency in documenting encounters with patients who have strong accents or with an interpreter present.\nOur next steps will focus on expanding the pilot to include more departments, capturing a wider variety of clinical cases and patient demographics. This expansion is critical to ensure that the AI system’s translation accuracy remains robust across different races, primary languages, ages, and sexes. Additionally, by involving a more diverse group of providers, we aim to account for diversity in medical scenarios and in interview and note-writing styles. This will further enhance the system’s adaptability to varying clinical workflows and provider preferences, ensuring effectiveness across the organization.\nAs we expand, training and support will be critical to help clinicians understand how to effectively integrate this AI tool into their practice. This training will address both technical use and awareness of the system’s limitations, including potential omissions, hallucinations and inaccuracies.\nDiscussion\nThe process of integrating AI into healthcare presents both significant opportunities and challenges. Our initiative builds upon the existing foundation laid by various organizations, focusing on essential principles such as fairness, equity, robustness, privacy, safety, transparency, explainability, and accountability, with an added emphasis on the tangible benefits for patients, healthcare providers, and the organization at large.\nThe establishment of a multidisciplinary committee was a strategic step that facilitated smooth deliberations and decision-making. By aligning core values and priorities from the outset, the committee was able to navigate complex issues effectively. The adoption of a use-case approach for scenarios with ambiguous or conflicting requirements underscores the flexibility and adaptability of our framework. This approach ensures that while maintaining consistency with our core values, we can tailor AI integration to specific contexts, thereby avoiding one-size-fits-all solutions that may not serve the diverse needs of our patient population.\nThe reflective process initiated by our AI integration efforts has broadened our perspective on patient equity and fairness. It has prompted us to reconsider not only AI-related technologies but also other aspects of healthcare provision that may have previously been accepted without sufficient scrutiny for bias or inequity. This introspection is a testament to the transformative potential of AI in catalyzing more equitable healthcare practices.\nOngoing monitoring and reassessment of AI systems are critical, given the dynamic nature of both the technology and the healthcare landscape. Unlike static technologies, AI models evolve based on new data, changing clinical practices, and patient demographics. This evolution necessitates a proactive approach to ensure that AI tools remain effective, ethical, and aligned with our healthcare goals. Collaboration with vendors is essential in this context, as their insights and updates to AI models play a crucial role in maintaining system performance and relevance.\nOur exploration of generative AI in ambient documentation has shed light on the specific challenges associated with monitoring these technologies. Despite the lack of straightforward metrics for performance evaluation, we have developed a framework centered on clinical outcomes and clinician feedback. As we continue to expand AI applications within healthcare, a critical area of focus will be the analysis of performance across different demographics to ensure equity and effectiveness. Engaging a broad spectrum of users in providing feedback will be vital in refining these technologies to meet the diverse needs of the healthcare community effectively. Further, these processes involved considerable manual effort. Automating the collection of key metrics and alerting when metrics change beyond pre-determined points will be important as these tools scale.\nConclusion\nWe have outlined a methodology for integrating AI into healthcare settings, emphasizing the establishment of comprehensive guidelines and operational frameworks applicable across the spectrum of AI tools. Our multidisciplinary approach provides a blueprint for healthcare institutions, non-profit organizations, and governmental agencies seeking to implement and monitor AI technologies responsibly.\nOur case study on ambient documentation, which utilizes generative AI, illustrates the practical application of our framework. While focusing on this specific use case, we described challenges and opportunities common to many AI implementations in healthcare. The case study underscores the importance of continuous monitoring, evaluation, and adaptation of AI systems to maintain their relevance and effectiveness in changing clinical environments. By engaging in proactive dialog with vendors and incorporating diverse clinician and patient feedback, we ensure that AI tools enhance healthcare outcomes while upholding ethical standards.\nThe integration of AI into healthcare is an evolving journey, requiring ongoing commitment to ethical considerations, performance monitoring, and stakeholder engagement. Our report offers a starting point for healthcare institutions to develop and refine their processes for the responsible integration of AI, advocating for a dynamic, responsive approach to AI deployment in healthcare settings. To further this endeavor, our study underscores the importance of fostering cross-institutional and public-private partnerships. These collaborations are envisioned to amplify the impact of our findings, paving the way for wider accessibility of AI technologies. By not requiring each organization to undertake the extensive assessments we conducted, we aim to streamline the adoption process. These strategic alliances will play a crucial role in scaling up AI deployment while maintaining stringent quality and ethical standards.\nAs we move forward, it is imperative that we continue to evaluate and refine these guidelines, ensuring they keep pace with technological advancements and the evolving needs of patients and healthcare providers alike.\nChange history\n30 January 2025\nA Correction to this paper has been published: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41746-025-01445-0\nReferences\nRajpurkar, P. et al.

Image: Unsplash/Accuray\n- Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming healthcare by improving diagnostic accuracy, enabling earlier disease detection and enhancing patient outcomes.\n- Effective and ethical AI solutions in healthcare require collaboration among AI engineers, data scientists, domain experts, and other stakeholders, which results in more effective AI models.\n- AI-driven diagnostics are democratizing healthcare by making early and accurate diagnoses more accessible, especially in regions with limited access to specialized medical professionals.\nThe healthcare sector is poised for a revolution, with artificial intelligence (AI) playing a pivotal role in transforming how we diagnose and treat diseases.\nAI’s ability to process vast amounts of data quickly and accurately is reshaping the landscape, offering new ways to improve health outcomes globally.\nHowever, building effective and accurate solutions that are culturally sensitive and inclusive requires collaboration across the plethora of needed skill sets. The result is better and faster access to health solutions.\nThe promise of AI in healthcare\nAI’s potential in healthcare is vast, ranging from predictive analytics and personalized treatment plans to improving diagnostic accuracy. The sheer volume of medical data generated daily – from patient records, clinical trials, medical imaging and wearable devices – can be overwhelming for human practitioners.\nAs AI can analyze and learn from this data, patterns and correlations that may go unnoticed by human eyes can be detected. This leads to earlier and more accurate diagnoses, which is crucial in improving patient outcomes.\nOne of the most promising areas of AI in healthcare is in diagnostics. Traditional diagnostic methods often rely on the subjective interpretation of medical professionals, which can sometimes result in variability in outcomes. AI can reduce this variability by providing consistent, data-driven insights, leading to more reliable diagnoses.\nCollaboration key to robust AI healthcare\nCollaboration in AI development is essential for creating effective, ethical and impactful solutions to the world’s most pressing challenges, whether that includes AI engineers, data scientists and domain experts. “Such kind of collaboration across people from different sectors and regions help build more ethical and trustworthy AI solutions,” says Rudradeb Mitra, CEO of Omdena, a collaborative AI platform.\nIn the healthcare sector, Omdena applies AI to diagnostic processes, particularly in underserved communities. These models assist medical professionals in identifying diseases more accurately – such as tuberculosis and diabetic retinopathy – and at earlier stages, thereby increasing the chances of successful treatment.\nThese projects involve training AI algorithms on large datasets of medical images. Taking a collaborative approach ensures that the AI models are robust, culturally sensitive and adaptable to various healthcare settings.\nThe World Economic Forum is also driving digital healthcare transformation by fostering a global, multi-stakeholder approach to accelerate the responsible integration of digital health solutions into healthcare systems worldwide.\nBy collaborating with governments, businesses and civil society, the Forum focuses on improving healthcare access, outcomes and equity through innovative technologies while addressing challenges such as data privacy, cybersecurity and ethical use of AI in healthcare.\nBy integrating AI models into healthcare systems, particularly in regions with limited access to specialized medical professionals, we can democratize healthcare and ensure that more people have access to early and accurate diagnoses.\nImpact on health outcomes\nEarly diagnosis is often the key to successful treatment. Diseases like cancer, for example, have a significantly higher survival rate when detected early. When breast cancer is detected at stage one, the five-year survival rate is over 90%. Colorectal cancer yields a 14% five-year survival rate when diagnosed in later stages but can be around 90% with early diagnosis. Therefore, the impact of AI-driven diagnostics on health outcomes cannot be overstated.\n“This not only improves patient outcomes but also makes healthcare more accessible to all and reduces the burden on healthcare systems by preventing the progression of diseases to more advanced stages, which are often more difficult and expensive to treat,” says Mitra.\nFor example, Omdena's AI-powered app in Liberia predicts malaria outbreaks and identifies high-risk areas, enabling health officials to take proactive measures, particularly for vulnerable groups such as children and pregnant women.\nAI is also transforming oncology by enabling personalized cancer treatments through genomic analysis, identifying mutations and tailoring therapies to a patient's unique cancer profile. This approach improves treatment efficacy, reduces side effects and accelerates drug discovery.\nAI has also been used in the early detection and prediction of cardiovascular diseases. Machine learning is used to analyse ECGs, medical imaging, and patient data. With studies having shown impressive accuracy rates, including of heart disease classification of 93%, AI is improving diagnostics and offering noninvasive methods for assessing cardiovascular risks, potentially saving lives.\nThe future of AI in healthcare\nAs AI continues to evolve, its role in healthcare will only become more critical. The ability to predict, diagnose and treat diseases with greater accuracy and efficiency will lead to healthier populations and more sustainable healthcare systems.\nWe at Omdena have seen how important collaboration and innovation are in realizing AI’s full potential in healthcare.\nHowever, the mission is not just to build AI models; it’s about creating solutions that are inclusive, equitable and capable of making a real difference in people’s lives.\nBy leveraging the power of AI for diagnostics, we can improve health outcomes and contribute to a future where healthcare is more accessible and effective for everyone, particularly in the communities that need it the most.\nDon't miss any update on this topic\nCreate a free account and access your personalized content collection with our latest publications and analyses.\nLicense and Republishing\nWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.\nThe views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum.\nStay up to date:\nArtificial Intelligence\nRelated topics:\nForum Stories newsletter\nBringing you weekly curated insights and analysis on the global issues that matter.", "select_response": "<think>\nThe webpage provided focuses on the transformative role of AI in healthcare, particularly in improving diagnostics and health outcomes.

A new collaboration with the Mayo Clinic brings physician team — and married couple — Chieh-Ju Chao and Chia-Chun Chiang to the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI (HAI) to learn how to bridge the gap.\nImproving Treatment for Migraine Patients\nAt the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, Chia-Chun Chiang splits her medical practice between treating patients who’ve suffered acute stroke and migraine sufferers who come to her to seek help with the intense headaches that can sometimes incapacitate them for weeks, months, or longer. Chiang, a specialist in headache medicine and vascular neurology, not only hopes to improve these daily realities for her patients but also wants to explore how AI may someday lead to better overall treatment through exciting new breakthroughs.\nFor the next year, Chiang will be a visiting scholar at Stanford HAI, where she’s exploring the intersection of AI and neurology. The appointment is part of a new collaborative program between HAI and the Mayo Clinic and will give Chiang a chance to do what she’s always loved — find innovative solutions to challenging medical questions.\nBorn in Taiwan, Chiang found her medical horizons were expanded early in her career, both by her neurosurgeon father and a series of influential mentors on two continents.\n“My father always encouraged me to think not just about day-to-day realities in medical practice but about making research breakthroughs in medicine — about discovery,” she says. “Arthur Chiou, a professor of biophotonics at National Yang Ming University, opened a window for me to see different types of medical research. Later, I came to the University of California, San Diego, and met Professor Shu Chien in the department of bioengineering. He got me into the world of using math and physics to solve medical research problems. It was inspiring.”\nChiang’s time at Stanford HAI will be spent on several research projects focusing on her special interest in migraine and stroke. She hopes to use AI to help doctors determine which of many preventive migraine medications might help chronic migraine sufferers — those experiencing migraine attacks more than 15 days per month — stave off debilitating attacks.\n“Right now there’s no way to predict if a patient will respond to medication A, B, C, D, or E,” she says. “It’s a trial-and-error process, where we start with one medication and wait three months to see if it helps. This can be a long time and a long process when you’re in pain. I’m hoping to be able to apply advanced machine learning technologies to the Mayo Clinic’s established headache database to help predict good matches or to develop personalized treatment plans for patients with migraine.”\nChiang is also collaborating with Nigam Shah, a Stanford professor of medicine and chief data scientist for Stanford Health Care, to be able to more effectively utilize all of a patient’s electronic health record data to understand which migraine patients might be at risk of stroke and cardiovascular disease.\n“Things like clinician notes, consultations, and admission notes are written in free text, which traditionally have been hard for data scientists to access,” she says. “Dr. Shah’s lab has developed several advanced machine learning tools tailored to health care notes that can extract and use this sort of information. We hope to be able to apply these tools to databases at the Mayo Clinic and at Stanford to give us some solid research results from two different health care systems.”\nChiang says AI is changing the field of neurology through innovations such as telemedicine and AI-assisted CT analysis, both of which benefit stroke patients, particularly those in isolated regions of the country where small hospitals may not have neurologists on staff. Continuing the introduction of relevant and user-friendly technology into health care, however, will require improved communication between those who develop AI and those who treat patients.\n“I’m very excited about the use of AI in my field, which is why I wanted to come to HAI and contribute to this process by stimulating more discussion and work between data scientists and clinicians,” she says. “I see patients who are suffering every day in clinic. It’s crucial for us to continue imagining how AI tools can be developed to improve their quality of life.”\nDeveloping Better Tools for Echocardiography\nMayo Clinic cardiologist Chieh-Ju Chao was a teenager in Taiwan when the college entrance exam set him on a trajectory to medical school. Deep down, though, the 18-year-old harbored a secret ambition.\n“I was happy to go into medicine, but I always loved physics,” he says. “It was always in the back of my mind. I love the beauty of the laws and formulas in physics and, as a kid, I dreamed of being the next Einstein or Feynman.” After medical school, Chao took postgraduate physics courses in Taiwan before becoming a postdoctoral fellow at UC San Diego, where he led a research project to build a 3D dynamic heart model. He began to see intersections between physics and medicine, particularly in the field of cardiology. “It was one of the most important periods of my life and one that really changed my career path,” he says.\nFor the next year, Chao will have a chance to deeply explore his interdisciplinary interests, as a visiting scholar at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence. As part of a collaborative program between Stanford HAI and the Mayo Clinic, facilitated and guided by HAI Co-Director Fei-Fei Li, Chao will expand his current research on the potential use of AI technology to augment echocardiography, which harnesses ultrasound waves to examine the anatomy and dynamics of the heart. Chao hopes his dual background in medicine and technology will allow him to bridge the knowledge gap that often exists between health care and technology professionals and to accelerate the expansion of AI systems into clinical medicine at the Mayo Clinic and elsewhere.\n“The usual pathway for this has always been for clinicians to come up with an idea, then talk to AI engineers,” he says. “But that process can take a long time because communication between the two disciplines is not easy. For the first time, this program between Mayo and HAI sends clinicians out into the AI field to learn some of these skills and take them back. I knew this was something I wanted to do. I see myself as a person who will be able to speak both languages.”\nAt the Mayo Clinic, Chao studies how AI models might be used to solve clinical questions, such as how to classify different grades of cardiac diastolic dysfunction, which occur when the heart’s damaged ventricles are unable to completely fill with blood. (That work, in fact, resulted in Chao being named a “Young Investigator Award” finalist at the 2022 American College of Cardiology Conference.)\nAt Stanford HAI, he’ll focus on two primary research projects. The first will incorporate the use of AI to give cardiologists a more realistic view of the heart during procedures such as aortic and mitral valve replacements, which are often done with the use of catheters rather than open-heart surgery. Positioning these catheters currently relies on the 2D images provided by echocardiogram and X-ray. Chao envisions AI models that might be able to compile that information with CT images of the patient’s heart, giving doctors a real-time 3D and even hologram-based picture that would make the procedure smoother and more efficient.\n“Our goal is to improve success rates, minimize complications, and lessen radiation exposure through shorter procedures,” Chao says. “It could potentially shorten procedure times from five or six hours to two or three and allow a more efficient use of our procedure room resources.”\nSecondly, Chao will explore the potential use of AI visual linguistic models to generate time-consuming echocardiography reports more efficiently. Ideally, the model would have the capacity to do an initial interpretation of the study and generate a preliminary report that could then be reviewed by clinicians.\n“This would be an advancement in current AI application in the medical field,” Chao says. “People have been trying to create systems that can report on chest X-rays, which are a single image. In an echo study, we’re dealing with video clips that record the cardiac dynamics from different views. It’s an even more exciting challenge.”\nChao says he’s motivated both by colleagues at the Mayo Clinic who are enthusiastic about this work as well as the range of scholars and technical resources he’s finding at Stanford HAI.\n“It’s amazing to work with cutting-edge AI scientists and the latest technology,” he says. “Talking about my clinical ideas with colleagues here in this setting is a very different and immersive learning experience for me, and these conversations are generating new ideas as I learn about what people are doing here and about potential applications I hadn’t thought about. It’s all really exciting.”\nStanford HAI’s mission is to advance AI research, education, policy and practice to improve the human condition.

In addition, strong performance requires models to move beyond short passages of text to understand complex multimodal data, including images, videos, and the extensive length and breadth of electronic health records (EHRs). With this in mind, Gemini models have demonstrated a leap forward in multimodal and long-context reasoning, which presents substantial potential in medicine.\nToday we present two recent research papers in which we explore the possibilities of Gemini in the healthcare space and introduce Med-Gemini, a new family of next-generation models fine-tuned for the medical domain. This family of models builds upon Google’s Gemini models by fine-tuning on de-identified medical data while inheriting Gemini’s native reasoning, multimodal, and long-context abilities. Med-Gemini builds on our initial research into medically tuned large language models with Med-PaLM.\nThe first paper, “Capabilities of Gemini Models in Medicine”, describes a broad exploration of Gemini’s capabilities across a wide range of text, image, video, and EHR tasks. We benchmark the new Med-Gemini models on 14 tasks spanning text, multimodal and long-context applications, and demonstrate strong results, including a new state-of-the-art of 91.1% accuracy for the popular MedQA benchmark.\nIn the second paper, “Advancing Multimodal Medical Capabilities of Gemini”, we offer a deeper dive into Med-Gemini’s multimodal capabilities through application to radiology, pathology, dermatology, ophthalmology, and genomics in healthcare. We focus on clinical applicability, improving benchmarks, and leveraging specialist evaluations to assess the models’ capabilities. For the first time, we demonstrate how large multimodal models can interpret complex 3D scans, answer clinical questions, and generate state-of-the-art radiology reports. Additionally, we demonstrate a novel mechanism to encode genomic information for risk prediction using large language models across a wealth of disease areas with strong results.\nThe broad capabilities of Gemini models in medicine\nIn “Capabilities of Gemini Models in Medicine”, we enhance our models’ clinical reasoning capabilities through self-training and web search integration, while improving multimodal performance through fine-tuning and customized encoders.\nWe then benchmark Med-Gemini models on 14 tasks spanning text, multimodal and long-context applications. In the popular MedQA US Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE)-style question benchmark, Med-Gemini achieves a state-of-the-art performance of 91.1% accuracy, surpassing our prior best of Med-PaLM 2 by 4.6% (shown below). We conducted a careful inspection of the MedQA benchmark with expert clinicians, and found that 7.4% of the questions were deemed unfit for evaluation as they either lacked key information or supported multiple plausible interpretations. We account for these data quality issues to more precisely characterize the performance of our model.\nOur approach utilizes uncertainty-guided web search to enable the model to use accurate and up-to-date information. This approach generalizes to achieve state-of-the-art performance in other challenging benchmarks, including complex diagnostic challenges from NEJM clinico-pathological conferences.\nOn multimodal benchmarks such as NEJM Image Challenges and multimodal USMLE-style questions, Med-Gemini achieves a new state of the art, surpassing GPT-4 V by a wide margin. We demonstrate the effectiveness of long-context capabilities through medical video and EHR question answering on which Med-Gemini surpasses prior bespoke methods in a zero-shot manner. In order to assess performance on common text-based tasks, we evaluated performance on medical text summarization and simplification of referral letter generation, finding that Med-Gemini–produced drafts were preferred to those of clinicians for succinctness, coherence, and in some cases also for accuracy. In multiple qualitative examples, we demonstrate the clear potential for Med-Gemini to provide accurate and useful conversation about multimodal artifacts such as medical imaging (dermatology or radiology) or long multimodal research articles.\nIn this safety-critical domain, considerable further research is needed before real-world application can be considered. For example, additional research and evaluations on potential biases, safety, and reliability are essential to ensure building safe applications. These systems should also be thoroughly evaluated not just in isolation, but with human experts in the loop.\nAdvancing multimodal medical capabilities\nOur second piece of research, “Advancing Multimodal Medical Capabilities of Gemini”, expands on our multimodal medical large language model work from 2023 by diving deeper into multimodal capabilities made possible by the Gemini family of models. We focus on tuning for radiology, pathology, dermatology, ophthalmology, and genomics applications in healthcare via Med-Gemini-2D, Med-Gemini-3D, and Med-Gemini-Polygenic.\nTrained on a range of conventional 2D medical images (chest X-rays, CT slices, pathology slides, etc) using de-identified medical data with free text labels, Med-Gemini-2D is able to perform a number of tasks, such as classification, visual question answering, and text generation. One example includes report generation for chest X-rays, which was shown to exceed previous state-of-the-art results by up to 12% across normal and abnormal scans from two separate datasets.\nMed-Gemini-3D can also understand and write radiology reports for 3D studies like computed tomography (CT) imaging of the head (example shown below). Volumetric, 3D scans are an essential tool in modern medicine, providing more context for countless diagnostic and treatment decisions requiring an understanding of 3D anatomy. Technically, 3D reflects a meaningful jump in multimodal clinical task complexity when compared to 2D. Additionally, in evaluation of the reports generated by Med-Gemini-3D, more than half were determined to result in the same care recommendations made by a radiologist. However, additional real-world research and validation is needed to ensure consistent expert reporting quality.\nBeyond report generation, Med-Gemini-2D also achieves a new state-of-the-art for chest X-ray visual question answering, and performs well across a range of classification tasks across histopathology, ophthalmology, dermatology, and radiology, approaching the performance of task-specific models.\nBeyond imaging, our new Med-Gemini-Polygenic research model is the first language model to perform disease and health outcome prediction from genomic data. The model outperforms previous linear polygenic scores for prediction of eight health outcomes (depression, stroke, glaucoma, rheumatoid arthritis, all cause mortality, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), type 2 diabetes) and is surprisingly able to predict an additional six health outcomes for which it had not explicitly been trained. Based on this performance, we believe the model is able to leverage intrinsic knowledge about genetic correlation for predicting health outcomes.\nEvaluation is an increasingly critical piece of research in this domain. In this work the team explores both benchmarks and other objective measures for classification and closed-ended questions (e.g., yes/no or limited choice formats) as well as specialist panel-based assessments for text generation and open-ended questions. For the former, the field has relied on traditional benchmarks to provide objective measures of progress, and we use many of them in our research today. For the latter, we believe evaluation is still in its infancy and will benefit from more input across a broad range of health professions.\nConclusion\nOur research provides a glimpse of an exciting future where AI can broadly and deeply contribute to the medical domain. Med-Gemini demonstrates powerful multimodal capabilities that have the potential to assist in clinician, researcher, and patient workflows. While our findings are promising, and provide a step forward in the potential of AI models in medicine, it is important for these methods to be thoroughly tested in a variety of settings beyond traditional benchmarks. This is an essential step to ensure models like these are safe and reliable before being deployed in real-world situations involving patients or other users.\nWe’re excited about the potential of Med-Gemini in the medical domain and believe the broader researcher and developer community can play a role in continuing to improve the model’s safety and reliability, while also helping us better understand novel use cases. While Med-Gemini is not a product offering available for commercial use, one of the next steps is to explore its capabilities through collaboration with Google Cloud healthcare and life science customers and researchers.

Typically, this entails exciting conversations around Google’s mobile platform, Android, or the newest hardware the company is planning to release. However, this year, something else stole the show: Google’s incredible progress in artificial intelligence (AI).\nAI has been all the buzz in both Silicon Valley and around the world for the last few months, especially after the release of Chat-GPT and advanced generative AI systems. This has triggered somewhat of a frantic rat-race amongst tech giants: everyone wants a piece of the AI pie, and the race to the top is intense.\nFor example, Microsoft is investing significant resources into its AI capabilities, relentlessly trying to integrate the technology across a variety of sectors, ranging from manufacturing to healthcare. Amazon is also innovating in this space, offering customers turn-key services to build their own machine learning and AI models.\nIn a similar fashion, Google has made incredible strides in its own AI journey. Though many may suspect that the buzz around AI is relatively new, the company has actually been setting the foundation for advanced language models and usable AI for many years. This work has culminated in products with incredible potential, including PaLM 2, Google’s latest generation large language model.\nAs an introduction to PaLM 2, Zoubin Ghahramani, Vice President of Google DeepMind, wrote last week: “today we’re introducing PaLM 2, our next generation language model. PaLM 2 is a state-of-the-art language model with improved multilingual, reasoning and coding capabilities.” He goes on to describe these capabilities further, discussing how PaLM 2 is trained across 100 languages, has a higher capability for common sense reasoning and advanced mathematics and logic, and can even generate advanced code.\nNotably, Ghahramani also discusses one of the most highly anticipated arenas of impact for AI: healthcare. He delves into Med-PaLM 2, the large language model developed specifically to generate medical insights: “trained by our health research teams with medical knowledge, [Med-PaLM 2] can answer questions and summarize insights from a variety of dense medical texts. It achieves state-of-the-art results in medical competency, and was the first large language model to perform at “expert” level on U.S. Medical Licensing Exam-style [USMLE] questions. We're now adding multimodal capabilities to synthesize information like x-rays and mammograms to one day improve patient outcomes. Med-PaLM 2 will open up to a small group of Cloud customers for feedback later this summer to identify safe, helpful use cases.”\nThe full 2023 keynote can be viewed here:\nGoogle Cloud, especially for Healthcare, has been incredibly successful over the last few years. For example, Google Cloud’s Healthcare Data Engine is an industry-leading platform to optimize interoperability in healthcare, which could resolve some of the sector’s most challenging problems: significant data-fragmentation, lack of cohesive insights, and splintered patient journeys.\nGoogle Cloud’s Global Director of Healthcare Strategy & Solutions, Aashima Gupta, and Global Director of Health Plan Strategy & Solutions, Amy Waldron, explain: “Industry-tailored LLMs like Med-PaLM 2 are part of a burgeoning family of generative AI technologies that have the potential to significantly enhance healthcare experiences. We’re looking forward to working with our customers to understand how Med-PaLM 2 might be used to facilitate rich, informative discussions, answer complex medical questions, and find insights in complicated and unstructured medical texts. They might also explore its utility to help draft short- and long-form responses and summarize documentation and insights from internal data sets and bodies of scientific knowledge.”\nThe Cloud team was also responsible for launching the Medical Imaging Suite, a comprehensive AI platform to make medical imaging data “accessible, interoperable, and useful.”\nUndoubtedly, the development of PaLM 2 will be a gamechanger for healthcare. Whether it be used to conduct advanced analytics of vast amounts of public health or patient data, or simply as a means to better triage and improve physician workflows, the technology has immense potential to create tangible impact.\nEspecially with regards to synthesis and insight generation, this technology may be immensely useful for organizations that want to scale their tactical approach to improving patient outcomes. For example, for public entities, harnessing this technology may one day make possible the ingestion of terabytes of public health data that is otherwise unstructured to generate usable insights. For private organizations, this technology could prove to be a significant boon in the realms of interoperability, improving patient journeys, and succeeding in true longitudinal care.\nNevertheless, this technology requires guardrails. While there is significant potential for beneficial use, there is also some “fear of the unknown.” That is, in the wrong hands, the powerful technology that drives these advancements in AI can have negative repercussions. This is a prime reason why the developer conference had an entire segment dedicated to the “responsible development” of AI, serving as a reminder of the checks and balances needed in this rapidly growing arena of technology. Nonetheless, if developers and innovators are able to create and harness this technology in a safe and sustainable manner, it may potentially change the face of healthcare delivery for generations to come.", "select_response": "<think>\nThe purpose of the current search round is to address specific information gaps related to AI in healthcare, particularly with regard to case studies, cost-effectiveness data, patient satisfaction metrics, comparative studies, failure cases, and treatment planning protocols.

But how do leading institutions like the Mayo Clinic turn AI’s potential into real-world impact? With a strategic approach and a commitment to responsible innovation, Mayo Clinic is setting a new benchmark for how AI can enhance patient care and streamline medical workflows.\nKey speakers\n- Moderator: Gabriel Perna, Modern Healthcare’s Digital Health Editor\n- Speaker: Cris Ross, Mayo Clinic’s Former CIO\nThese insights came from our ScaleUp:AI event in November 2024, an industry-leading global conference that features topics across technologies and industries. Watch the full session below:\nKey takeaways\n- Workforce shortages: AI can help alleviate the strain by automating tasks and improving efficiency.\n- Data complexity: Healthcare generates about 30% of the world’s data, growing at an annual rate of 36%. AI helps structure this data for quality management, reimbursement, and research.\n- Patient experience: AI tools are being deployed to improve patient interactions, such as summarizing doctor visits for stressed patients who might struggle to retain information.\n- Access, affordability, and quality: AI can optimize medical workflows, reducing avoidable medical injuries and improving treatment quality.\n- Cures for complex diseases: AI is already making strides in accelerating diagnostics and treatment strategies for conditions such as atrial fibrillation and cancer.\nAddressing healthcare challenges with AI\nWorkforce shortages and data complexity\nThe healthcare industry is facing a generational shortage of professionals, which poses significant challenges for patient care. Ross emphasized that AI can help bridge this gap by taking on administrative and repetitive tasks, allowing medical professionals to focus on patient interactions and complex decision-making.\n“We have a generational shortage of healthcare professionals.”\n“We have a generational shortage of healthcare professionals,” Ross explained. “AI has some challenges in other industries from an ethical perspective on reduction in jobs, but look, if it can do the jobs of people in healthcare, it’s a hero job.”\nAt the same time, healthcare is one of the most data-intensive industries, with an estimated 30% of the world’s healthcare-related data. This data grows at a staggering 36% annual rate, presenting both challenges and opportunities for AI.\n“Doctors want to have conversations with patients,” Ross said. “So what can we do to improve the patient experience by using AI tools to be explainers, so patients can ask questions of a record and have a computer answer in a sensible way, where doctors don’t have time to answer those questions.”\nEnhancing patient experience and healthcare accessibility\nThe stress and confusion that often accompany medical visits make it difficult for patients to absorb and retain crucial health information. AI tools can improve patient experiences by summarizing doctor visits and providing personalized explanations.\nAdditionally, quality healthcare remains out of reach for many due to accessibility and affordability issues. AI is being used to improve workflow efficiencies, streamline diagnoses, and enhance decision-making to reduce costs and increase care quality.\n“We still have tens of thousands of people who are injured every year in the U.S. from medical injury that’s avoidable. So there’s all sorts of things we can do to improve.” Ross noted. AI can help reduce these errors, ensure more efficient triage, and make scheduling and operational management more effective.\nAdvancing treatments and accelerating disease detection\nAI is accelerating disease detection and treatment breakthroughs, particularly in areas like arrhythmia detection, cancer treatment, and transplant matching.\n“Some of the stuff that we’ve done in Mayo is, for instance, detection of arrhythmias,” Ross explained. “We’re at the point where the rhythms can be detected on a single lead ECG, meaning something that can be in an Apple watch or some other device. From that, we can both diagnose arrhythmias and treat them. So when a patient goes into arrhythmia, you can take interventions to get them back into rhythm.”\nHe also highlighted Mayo Clinic’s work with Google on radiotherapy optimization: “We worked with Google to develop algorithms to do better radiotherapy treatment of disease, and we started with head and neck cancers.” With AI-powered radiotherapy, AI can maximize tumor targeting while minimizing damage to surrounding tissue, potentially transforming cancer treatment outcomes.\nAI at scale: Mayo Clinic’s enterprise-wide approach\nUnlike many healthcare institutions that focus on isolated AI projects, Mayo Clinic has developed an enterprise-wide AI strategy:\nData consolidation: Over a decade, Mayo Clinic unified its electronic health records into a single system, creating a comprehensive, structured patient database.\nAI factory: Hosted on Google Cloud’s Vertex AI, Mayo Clinic’s AI factory supports over 250 AI research and deployment projects, integrating models with real-time patient data.\nCloud app factory: Ensuring AI models can be deployed efficiently within workflows, bridging the gap between innovation and clinical application.\n“We have two jobs: One is to support technology for the world’s best hospital. The second is to innovate at Silicon Valley speed and put solutions into production.”\n“We have two jobs,” Ross explained. “One is to support technology for the world’s best hospital. The second is to innovate at Silicon Valley speed and put solutions into production.”\n“We need to go as fast as we can, but no faster than is safe”\nAs AI adoption grows, Ross urged the industry to focus on the five core challenges he outlined. Looking ahead, he sees a future where startups, research institutions, and cloud platforms collaborate to create transformative healthcare solutions.\n“We need to go as fast as we can, but no faster than is safe,” he concluded, reinforcing the importance of responsible AI deployment in healthcare.\nWith AI-driven solutions already improving diagnosis, treatment, and patient care, Mayo Clinic’s work serves as a blueprint for the future of AI in medicine.\nWatch more sessions from ScaleUp:AI, and see scaleup.events for updates on ScaleUp:AI 2025.", "select_response": "<think>\nThe purpose of the search round is to gather information regarding specific case studies from major healthcare institutions (like the Mayo Clinic), detailed cost-effectiveness data, ROI statistics, patient satisfaction metrics with AI-assisted care, comparative studies between traditional vs AI-assisted healthcare delivery, recent failure cases or limitations, and detailed treatment planning protocols and success rates. \n\nThe webpage focuses on the Mayo Clinic's application of AI in healthcare, covering how AI is improving patient care, streamlining medical workflows, and addressing workforce shortages and data complexities.

Last year at Google Health’s …\nContent: Our progress on generative AI in health\nLast year at Google Health’s Check Up event, we introduced Med-PaLM 2, our large language model (LLM) fine-tuned for healthcare. Since introducing that research, the model has become available to a set of global customer and partner organizations that are building solutions for a range of uses — including streamlining nurse handoffs and supporting clinicians’ documentation. At the end of last year, we introduced MedLM, a family of foundation models for healthcare built on Med-PaLM 2, and made it more broadly available through Google Cloud’s Vertex AI platform.\nSince then, our work on generative AI for healthcare has progressed — from the new ways we’re training our health AI models to our latest research on applying AI to the healthcare industry.\nNew modalities in models for healthcare\nMedicine is a multimodal discipline; it’s made up of different types of information stored across formats — like radiology images, lab results, genomics data, environmental context and more. To get a fuller understanding of a person’s health, we need to build technology that understands all of this information.\nWe’re bringing new capabilities to our models with the hope of making generative AI more helpful to healthcare organizations and people’s health. We just introduced MedLM for Chest X-ray, which has the potential to help transform radiology workflows by helping with the classification of chest X-rays for a variety of use cases. We’re starting with Chest X-rays because they are critical in detecting lung and heart conditions. MedLM for Chest X-ray is now available to trusted testers in an experimental preview on Google Cloud.\nResearch on fine-tuning our models for the medical domain\nApproximately 30% of the world’s data volume is being generated by the healthcare industry - and is growing at 36% annually. This includes large quantities of text, images, audio, and video. And further, important information about patients' histories is often buried deep in a medical record, making it difficult to find relevant information quickly.\nFor these reasons, we’re researching how a version of the Gemini model, fine-tuned for the medical domain, can unlock new capabilities for advanced reasoning, understanding a high volume of context, and processing multiple modalities. Our latest research resulted in state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark for the U.S. Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE)-style questions at 91.1%, and on a video dataset called MedVidQA.\nAnd because our Gemini models are multimodal, we were able to apply this fine-tuned model to other clinical benchmarks — including answering questions about chest X-ray images and genomics information. We’re also seeing promising results from our fine-tuned models on complex tasks such as report generation for 2D images like X-rays, as well as 3D images like brain CT scans – representing a step-change in our medical AI capabilities. While this work is still in the research phase, there’s potential for generative AI in radiology to bring assistive capabilities to health organizations.\nA Personal Health LLM for personalized coaching and recommendations\nFitbit and Google Research are working together to build a Personal Health Large Language Model that can power personalized health and wellness features in the Fitbit mobile app, helping people get even more insights and recommendations from the data from their Fitbit and Pixel devices. This model is being fine-tuned to deliver personalized coaching capabilities, like actionable messages and guidance, that can be individualized based on personal health and fitness goals. For example, this model may be able to analyze variations in your sleep patterns and sleep quality, and then suggest recommendations on how you might change the intensity of your workout based on those insights.\nThis model is being built on Gemini models and fine-tuned on a de-identified, diverse set of health signals from high-quality research case studies. The studies are being collected and validated in partnership with accredited coaches and wellness experts, enabling the model to exhibit profound reasoning capabilities on physiological and behavioral data. For example, we’re testing performance using sleep medicine certification exam-like practice tests, and are already seeing that our model currently performs well. We'll continue to iterate and learn as we build this new Personal Health Large Language Model, and will share more research soon.\nBetter understanding the assistive capabilities of AI\nGenerative AI is already working as an assistive tool for clinicians, helping them with administrative tasks like documentation that typically takes up hours of time. We’re not stopping there – we’re now building on our work with partners to explore what’s possible.\nEarlier this year, we introduced AMIE (Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer), a research AI system built on a LLM and optimized for diagnostic reasoning and clinical conversations. We explored the performance of a LLM by simulating text-based consultations with patient actors, adapting a well-known framework of “Objective Structured Clinical Examinations” to a consumer-facing user interface. In a randomized comparison with real primary care clinicians performing the same simulated text consultations, appropriately trained LLM rated higher than or on par with these consultations when measured for traits like diagnostic accuracy, empathy and helpful explanation.\nOur next step is to test this with a healthcare organization to see how a LLM like AMIE can be helpful in supporting clinical conversations. We hope to learn how clinicians and patients perceive its use within the care experience with oversight from medical professionals.\nHealthcare presents some of society’s most complex challenges.

The move marks Google's latest attempt to monetize health-care industry AI tools, as competition for market...\nContent: Google on Wednesday announced MedLM, a suite of new health-care-specific artificial intelligence models designed to help clinicians and researchers carry out complex studies, summarize doctor-patient interactions and more.\nThe move marks Google's latest attempt to monetize health-care industry AI tools, as competition for market share remains fierce between competitors like Amazon and Microsoft. CNBC spoke with companies that have been testing Google's technology, like HCA Healthcare, and experts say the potential for impact is real, though they are taking steps to implement it carefully.\nThe MedLM suite includes a large and a medium-sized AI model, both built on Med-PaLM 2, a large language model trained on medical data that Google first announced in March. It is generally available to eligible Google Cloud customers in the U.S. starting Wednesday, and Google said while the cost of the AI suite varies depending on how companies use the different models, the medium-sized model is less expensive to run.\nGoogle said it also plans to introduce health-care-specific versions of Gemini, the company's newest and \"most capable\" AI model, to MedLM in the future.\nAashima Gupta, Google Cloud's global director of health-care strategy and solutions, said the company found that different medically tuned AI models can carry out certain tasks better than others. That's why Google decided to introduce a suite of models instead of trying to build a \"one-size-fits-all\" solution.\nFor instance, Google said its larger MedLM model is better for carrying out complicated tasks that require deep knowledge and lots of compute power, such as conducting a study using data from a health-care organization's entire patient population. But if companies need a more agile model that can be optimized for specific or real-time functions, such as summarizing an interaction between a doctor and patient, the medium-sized model should work better, according to Gupta.\nReal-world use cases\nWhen Google announced Med-PaLM 2 in March, the company initially said it could be used to answer questions like \"What are the first warning signs of pneumonia?\" and \"Can incontinence be cured?\" But as the company has tested the technology with customers, the use cases have changed, according to Greg Corrado, head of Google's health AI.\nCorrado said clinicians don't often need help with \"accessible\" questions about the nature of a disease, so Google hasn't seen much demand for those capabilities from customers. Instead, health organizations often want AI to help solve more back-office or logistical problems, like managing paperwork.\n\"They want something that's helping them with the real pain points and slowdowns that are in their workflow, that only they know,\" Corrado told CNBC.\nFor instance, HCA Healthcare, one of the largest health systems in the U.S., has been testing Google's AI technology since the spring. The company announced an official collaboration with Google Cloud in August that aims to use its generative AI to \"improve workflows on time-consuming tasks.\"\nDr. Michael Schlosser, senior vice president of care transformation and innovation at HCA, said the company has been using MedLM to help emergency medicine physicians automatically document their interactions with patients. For instance, HCA uses an ambient speech documentation system from a company called Augmedix to transcribe doctor-patient meetings. Google's MedLM suite can then take those transcripts and break them up into the components of an ER provider note.\nSchlosser said HCA has been using MedLM within emergency rooms at four hospitals, and the company wants to expand use over the next year. By January, Schlosser added, he expects Google's technology will be able to successfully generate more than half of a note without help from providers. For doctors who can spend up to four hours a day on clerical paperwork, Schlosser said saving that time and effort makes a meaningful difference.\n\"That's been a huge leap forward for us,\" Schlosser told CNBC. \"We now think we're going to be at a point where the AI, by itself, can create 60-plus percent of the note correctly on its own before we have the human doing the review and the editing.\"\nSchlosser said HCA is also working to use MedLM to develop a handoff tool for nurses. The tool can read through the electronic health record and identify relevant information for nurses to pass along to the next shift.\nHandoffs are \"laborious\" and a real pain point for nurses, so it would be \"powerful\" to automate the process, Schlosser said. Nurses across HCA's hospitals carry out around 400,000 handoffs a week, and two HCA hospitals have been testing the nurse handoff tool. Schlosser said nurses conduct a side-by-side comparison of a traditional handoff and an AI-generated handoff and provide feedback.\nWith both use cases, though, HCA has found that MedLM is not foolproof.\nSchlosser said the fact that AI models can spit out incorrect information is a big challenge, and HCA has been working with Google to come up with best practices to minimize those fabrications. He added that token limits, which restrict the amount of data that can be fed to the model, and managing the AI over time have been additional challenges for HCA.\n\"What I would say right now, is that the hype around the current use of these AI models in health care is outstripping the reality,\" Schlosser said. \"Everyone's contending with this problem, and no one has really let these models loose in a scaled way in the health-care systems because of that.\"\nEven so, Schlosser said providers' initial response to MedLM has been positive, and they recognize that they are not working with the finished product yet. He said HCA is working hard to implement the technology in a responsible way to avoid putting patients at risk.\n\"We're being very cautious with how we approach these AI models,\" he said. \"We're not using those use cases where the model outputs can somehow affect someone's diagnosis and treatment.\"\nGoogle also plans to introduce health-care-specific versions of Gemini to MedLM in the future. Its shares popped 5% after Gemini's launch earlier this month, but Google faced scrutiny over its demonstration video, which was not conducted in real time, the company confirmed to Bloomberg.\nIn a statement, Google told CNBC: \"The video is an illustrative depiction of the possibilities of interacting with Gemini, based on real multimodal prompts and outputs from testing. We look forward to seeing what people create when access to Gemini Pro opens on December 13.\"\nCorrado and Gupta of Google said Gemini is still in early stages, and it needs to be tested and evaluated with customers in controlled health-care settings before the model rolls out through MedLM more broadly.\n\"We've been testing Med-PaLM 2 with our customers for months, and now we're comfortable taking that as part of MedLM,\" Gupta said. \"Gemini will follow the same thing.\"\nSchlosser said HCA is \"very excited\" about Gemini, and the company is already working out plans to test the technology, \"We think that may give us an additional level of performance when we get that,\" he said.\nAnother company that has been using MedLM is BenchSci, which aims to use AI to solve problems in drug discovery. Google is an investor in BenchSci, and the company has been testing its MedLM technology for a few months.\nLiran Belenzon, BenchSci's co-founder and CEO, said the company has merged MedLM's AI with BenchSci's own technology to help scientists identify biomarkers, which are key to understanding how a disease progresses and how it can be cured.\nBelenzon said the company spent a lot of time testing and validating the model, including providing Google with feedback about necessary improvements. Now, Belenzon said BenchSci is in the process of bringing the technology to market more broadly.\n\"[MedLM] doesn't work out of the box, but it helps accelerate your specific efforts,\" he told CNBC in an interview.\nCorrado said research around MedLM is ongoing, and he thinks Google Cloud's health-care customers will be able to tune models for multiple different use cases within an organization. He added that Google will continue to develop domain-specific models that are \"smaller, cheaper, faster, better.\"\nLike BenchSci, Deloitte tested MedLM \"over and over\" before deploying the technology to health-care clients, said Dr. Kulleni Gebreyes, Deloitte's U.S. life sciences and health-care consulting leader.\nDeloitte is using Google's technology to help health systems and health plans answer members' questions about accessing care. If a patient needs a colonoscopy, for instance, they can use MedLM to look for providers based on gender, location or benefit coverage, as well as other qualifiers.\nGebreyes said clients have found that MedLM is accurate and efficient, but, like other models, the AI is not always great at deciphering a user's intent. It can be a challenge if patients don't know the right word or spelling for colonoscopy, or use other colloquial terms, she said.\n\"Ultimately, this does not substitute a diagnosis from a trained professional,\" Gebreyes told CNBC. \"It brings expertise closer and makes it more accessible.\"", "select_response": "<think>\nThe purpose of the search round is focused on obtaining specific case studies from major healthcare institutions, detailed cost-effectiveness data, ROI statistics, patient satisfaction metrics, comparative studies on traditional versus AI-assisted healthcare delivery, recent failure cases or limitations, and treatment planning protocols with success rates.

Now that the dust is beginning to settle, healthcare organizations are focused on getting real value from AI in 2025.\nWhile the AI hype persists, administrators are now more focused on securing a clear return on investment (ROI). They are prioritizing technologies that deliver immediate benefits and holding off on those that aren’t fully developed.\nAs the managing director and founder of IT Medical, I’ve seen how AI can transform healthcare by enhancing patient outcomes and streamlining clinical workflows. My work in health tech has fueled my passion for using AI to solve real-world challenges.\nIn this article, I’ll explore five key areas that I believe will become increasingly important in 2025 as organizations adopt AI to achieve meaningful value.\n1. AI-Driven Genomics For Precision Medicine\nAI has revolutionized genomic medicine, paving the way for rapid advancements in precision medicine, a key focus for the future. Cancer is recognized as a disease of the genome. However, our inability to effectively manage and analyze large volumes of genomic data has slowed progress across research and clinical applications. AI-driven genomics promises rapid improvements in cancer care by overcoming these challenges.\nFor instance, a 2024 paper leveraged AI to analyze large genomics and other omics datasets to predict survival outcomes for patients with pancreatic cancer. This demonstrated AI’s ability to generate actionable insights from large volumes of diverse data. Another paper from 2024 used machine learning to identify complex genomic variants associated with psychiatric disorders from standard genomics datasets.\nThese studies deepen our understanding of individual disease risks and support personalized treatment and prevention strategies.\n2. Next-Generation Medical Imaging\nA cornerstone of diagnostics for cancer and other diseases, medical imaging has already benefited enormously from AI-driven processes, and 2025 promises further achievements.\nA study published in January 2025 demonstrated AI’s real-world, large-scale implementation in medical imaging and its benefits to patient care. The research involved the optional AI-assisted mammography screening of 260,739 women from 463,094 patients. With AI support, radiologists increased breast cancer detection by 17.6% and lowered recall rates. Additionally, the AI group had a higher positive predictive value for recalls than the control group.\nGE Healthcare’s Roland Rott predicts that “2025 will showcase many more examples of AI’s ability to improve the lives of cancer patients and the care offered by their providers.” AI not only benefits diagnostic accuracy and supports clinical decision making but also enables faster radiology workflows and reduced costs.\n3. Generative AI For Clinical Documentation And Support\nTechnological developments like electronic health records (EHR) have improved clinical workflows but have led to problems like clinician burnout and documentation burdens. In 2025, AI promises to help reduce these burdens by providing more accurate and comprehensive support during clinical documentation procedures.\nAI-powered scribes can lead to a 170% increase in recording speed compared to in-person scribes, and the use of AI for documentation removes the need for manual documentation by clinicians, representing a potential 90% reduction in time spent on administrative tasks.\nIn a study of more than 100,000 virtual healthcare encounters, clinicians assessed AI-conducted patient interviews and diagnoses. Upon review, they agreed with the AI-generated diagnoses in 84.2% of cases and the top-ranked diagnoses in 60.9% of cases. These results demonstrate AI’s effectiveness in supporting clinical diagnosis in addition to routine documentation tasks.\n4. Integration of AI And IoMT\nThe Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is an interconnected system of medical devices and other technologies that track health parameters and monitor patients. First mentioned in 1999, the IoMT has grown to an estimated market value of 97.7% billion in 2025.\nThe IoMT enables patients to take tests at home, receive reminders to take medicine and allows for real-time monitoring. Wearable technologies are a central pillar of the IoMT, allowing health parameters to be recorded and shared with high accuracy. The data collected by these devices includes but is not limited to blood glucose levels, electrocardiogram readings, skin temperature and respiration rates. This makes them indispensable for tracking chronic diseases such as diabetes and predicting acute health events.\nFor instance, a randomized controlled trial found that daily remote monitoring of cardiovascular parameters and integrating these data within neural network modeling significantly improved risk stratification and appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) treatments. Another randomized controlled trial found continuous glucose monitoring resulted in a statistically significant reduction in hypoglycemia.\n5. AI-Driven Remote Patient Monitoring\nAn essential role of AI lies in remote patient engagement and monitoring. AI-powered assistants mean patients don’t need to rely on non-personalized online information. Instead, they can query symptoms against a personalized system that accounts for their medical history, including recent real-time data.\nA study found that 90% of patients using AI assistants reported receiving useful information for their health problems and perceived it as a helpful diagnostic tool. A paper from January 2025 established a model called CRAFT-MD for testing the applicability of AI models for patient engagement, medical history tracking and questioning, highlighting areas for improvement as these tools become more widespread within healthcare.\nUltimately, AI-driven remote patient engagement is poised to significantly enhance personalized healthcare and improve patient outcomes as its applications expand.\nConclusion\nIn 2025, AI innovations look set to transform healthcare by facilitating precision medicine, improving diagnostic accuracy, enhancing patient experience and streamlining clinical workflows. Early adopters who leverage AI-driven genomics, next-generation imaging, advanced clinical documentation and integrated IoMT systems are poised to achieve significant ROI and better patient outcomes in 2025.\nTo adopt AI successfully, focus on areas where it delivers immediate value, like enhancing diagnostics or reducing administrative tasks. Ensure smooth integration with existing systems, invest in staff training to boost AI literacy and choose a provider with proven healthcare AI expertise for reliable, long-term support.\nAs more healthcare providers embrace these transformative AI solutions, the industry stands on the brink of a new era marked by efficiency, innovation and improved health.\nForbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives.

In other words, machines can be given access to large amounts of information, and trained to solve problems, spot patterns and make recommendations. Common examples of AI in everyday life are virtual assistants like Alexa and Siri.\nWhat you might not know is that AI has been and is being used for a variety of healthcare applications. Here’s a look at how AI can be helpful in healthcare, and what to watch for as it evolves.\nWhat can AI technology in healthcare do for me?\nA report from the National Academy of Medicine identified three potential benefits of AI in healthcare: improving outcomes for both patients and clinical teams, lowering healthcare costs, and benefitting population health.\nFrom preventive screenings to diagnosis and treatment, AI is being used throughout the continuum of care today. Here are two examples:\nPreventive care\nCancer screenings that use radiology, like a mammogram or lung cancer screening, can leverage AI to help produce results faster.\nFor example, in polycystic kidney disease (PKD), researchers discovered that the size of the kidneys — specifically, an attribute known as total kidney volume — correlated with how rapidly kidney function was going to decline in the future.\nBut assessing total kidney volume, though incredibly informative, involves analyzing dozens of kidney images, one slide after another — a laborious process that can take about 45 minutes per patient. With the innovations developed at the PKD Center at Mayo Clinic, researchers now use artificial intelligence (AI) to automate the process, generating results in a matter of seconds.\nBradley J. Erickson, M.D., Ph.D., director of Mayo Clinic’s Radiology Informatics Lab, says that AI can complete time-consuming or mundane work for radiology professionals, like tracing tumors and structures, or measuring amounts of fat and muscle. “If a computer can do that first pass, that can help us a lot,” says Dr. Erickson.\nRisk assessment\nIn a Mayo Clinic cardiology study, AI successfully identified people at risk of left ventricular dysfunction, which is the medical name for a weak heart pump, even though the individuals had no noticeable symptoms. And that’s far from the only intersection of cardiology and AI.\n“We have an AI model now that can incidentally say, ‘Hey, you’ve got a lot of coronary artery calcium, and you’re at high risk for a heart attack or a stroke in five or 10 years,’ ” says Bhavik Patel, M.D., M.B.A., the chief artificial intelligence officer at Mayo Clinic in Arizona.\nHow can AI technology advance medicine and public health?\nWhen it comes to supporting the overall health of a population, AI can help people manage chronic illnesses themselves — think asthma, diabetes and high blood pressure — by connecting certain people with relevant screening and therapy, and reminding them to take steps in their care, such as take medication.\nAI also can help promote information on disease prevention online, reaching large numbers of people quickly, and even analyze text on social media to predict outbreaks. Considering the example of a widespread public health crisis, think of how these examples might have supported people during the early stages of COVID-19. For example, a study found that internet searches for terms related to COVID-19 were correlated with actual COVID-19 cases. Here, AI could have been used to predict where an outbreak would happen, and then help officials know how to best communicate and make decisions to help stop the spread.\nHow can AI solutions assist in providing superior patient care?\nYou might think that healthcare from a computer isn’t equal to what a human can provide. That’s true in many situations, but it isn’t always the case.\nStudies have shown that in some situations, AI can do a more accurate job than humans. For example, AI has done a more accurate job than current pathology methods in predicting who will survive malignant mesothelioma, which is a type of cancer that impacts the internal organs. AI is used to identify colon polyps and has been shown to improve colonoscopy accuracy and diagnose colorectal cancer as accurately as skilled endoscopists can.\nIn a study of a social media forum, most people asking healthcare questions preferred responses from an AI-powered chatbot over those from physicians, ranking the chatbot’s answers higher in quality and empathy. However, the researchers conducting this study emphasize that their results only suggest the value of such chatbots in answering patients’ questions, and recommend it be followed up with a more convincing study.\nHow can physicians use AI and machine learning in healthcare?\nOne of the key things that AI may be able to do to help healthcare professionals is save them time. For example:\n- Keeping up with current advances. When physicians are actively participating in caring for people and other clinical duties, it can be challenging for them to keep pace with evolving technological advances that support care. AI can work with huge volumes of information — from medical journals to healthcare records — and highlight the most relevant pieces.\n- Taking care of tedious work. When a healthcare professional must complete tasks like writing clinical notes or filling out forms, AI could potentially complete the task faster than traditional methods, even if revision was needed to refine the first pass AI makes.\nDespite the potential for AI to save time for healthcare professionals, AI isn’t intended to replace humans. The American Medical Association commonly refers to “augmented intelligence,” which stresses the importance of AI assisting, rather than replacing, healthcare professionals. In the case of current AI applications and technology, healthcare professionals are still needed to provide:\n- Clinical context for the algorithms that train AI.\n- Accurate and relevant information for AI to analyze.\n- Translation of AI findings to be meaningful for patients.\nA helpful comparison to reiterate the collaborative nature needed between AI and humans for healthcare is that in most cases, a human pilot is still needed to fly a plane. Although technology has enabled quite a bit of automation in flying today, people are needed to make adjustments, interpret the equipment’s data, and take over in cases of emergency.\nWhat are the drawbacks of AI in healthcare?\nDespite the many exciting possibilities for AI in healthcare, there are some risks to weigh:\n- If not properly trained, AI can lead to bias and discrimination. For example, if AI is trained on electronic health records, it is building only on people that can access healthcare and is perpetuating any human bias captured within the records.\n- AI chatbots can generate medical advice that is misleading or false, which is why there’s a need for effectively regulating their use.\nWhere can AI solutions take the healthcare industry next?\nAs AI continues to evolve and play a more prominent role in healthcare, the need for effective regulation and use becomes more critical. That’s why Mayo Clinic is a member of Health AI Partnership, which is focused on helping healthcare organizations evaluate and implement AI effectively, equitably and safely.\nIn terms of the possibilities for healthcare professionals to further integrate AI, Mark D.

Healthcare leaders are interested in AI tools that provide clear value, whether that’s a better clinician experience, …\nContent: Which AI Solutions Will Healthcare Organizations Adopt in 2025?\nHealthcare leaders are interested in AI tools that provide clear value, whether that’s a better clinician experience, reduced costs, increased administrative efficiencies or improved patient care. Here are some examples.\nAmbient Listening Reduces Clinical Documentation\nMany organizations are already going down the AI path with ambient listening, which are machine learning-powered audio solutions. Used by physicians initially before being expanded to nurses, the voice-recognition technology listens to and analyzes patient-provider conversations in real time, then extracts the relevant information for use in clinical notes, meeting billing and coding requirements. This enables clinicians to focus on the patient rather than having to multitask to complete documentation.\nA major reason that organizations are choosing ambient listening as a first step into AI is that they’ve evaluated and found clear ROI around these solutions when it comes to clinical efficiency and mitigating burnout.\nAnother reason is that ambient listening isn’t considered as risky as it was in the past. It now falls into a category of low-hanging fruit in the healthcare AI space, along with chart summarization.\nPushing for Increased Accuracy and Transparency in Generative AI\nSome healthcare organizations are beginning to experiment with retrieval-augmented generation. RAG is an AI framework that combines traditional vector database capabilities with LLMs. In other words, users get the benefits of a generative AI-powered chatbot that can access an organization’s more accurate and recent data.\nRAG allows the organization’s chatbot to produce better answers for staff in Q&A applications. This reduces some of the pitfalls of using generative AI tools.\nThe use of synthetic data in AI development and testing is another area that will see heightened interest, because having decent data to validate models is a challenge. This is part of a larger trend in model testing and model assurance capabilities. Performance claims for these models will face increasing scrutiny by healthcare organizations.\nIn the past, organizations didn’t know what questions to ask, but now there’s a lot more education available. Healthcare leaders want to ensure that the models do what they promise. Groups such as the Coalition for Health AI are creating frameworks to do this very thing.\nDIVE DEEPER: Demystify artificial intelligence adoption for your organization.\nMachine Vision Improves Patient Care\nAdding cameras, sensors and microphones to patient rooms enables healthcare organizations to collect more data that can be analyzed by AI platforms to improve care. For example, cameras can detect when a patient has turned over in bed, and the platform can alert care team members that they don’t need to turn the patient manually. Some cameras can also detect when a patient is getting up and alert staff so they can prevent a fall.\nAs these tools advance and more Internet of Medical Things sensors and cameras are added to patient rooms, more solutions will combine the AI capabilities of machine vision and ambient listening to improve proactive patient care as well as clinical workflows.\nWill AI Regulation Increase in 2025?\nThere’s already been an uptick in AI regulation, and we expect that to increase due to the nature of AI and fears of the unknown. Whether it comes from the government or from regulatory agencies and organizations, there will likely be new regulation to ensure AI isn’t used inappropriately. However, it’s important to achieve a balance between regulation and innovation.\nHealthcare organizations will also become more interested in learning how to comply with existing regulations such as the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology’s HTI-1 Final Rule regarding health data, technology and interoperability.\nPreparing for AI Adoption in Healthcare\nAI provides healthcare organizations with exciting possibilities for provider experience and patient care, but being able to use AI tools effectively comes down to IT infrastructure. Have an organization’s speeds and feeds been upgraded to handle these solutions?\nOrganizations looking to implement AI solutions should also work on getting their data shop in order. Even out-of-the-box, consumable AI solutions require good data governance. The more an organization understands its own data, the easier it is for the IT team to know how a solution will work in the organization’s environment. If the data isn’t in order, then AI implementation is going to be more of a challenge.\nAI governance is another important factor in achieving implementation success. An organization should have a good definition of what AI is and be able to ensure that the right people exist within the organization to discuss potential risks, ROI and cultural readiness. It’s worth having those discussions early and often to corral the different AI interests inside the organization.\nCONSIDER: When is the cloud right for healthcare organizations deploying AI?\nIT leaders also need to consider how to integrate AI solutions into workflows effectively while gaining user buy-in. The solution may be great, but if it’s implemented incorrectly, then you might as well have done nothing at all.\nMost healthcare organizations have limited budgets; therefore, some AI tools will make the cut while others won’t. Tools that don’t solve an existing problem or provide some form of return on the money being spent will be a lower priority for an organization, which may choose to do what it’s always done instead.\nOnce healthcare organizations are ready to move to the next step of AI implementation, it can be helpful to collaborate with a technology partner that has experience in the realm. CDW offers data workshops to help healthcare organizations prepare their data for AI. We also offer strategy engagements for modern data platforms and deploying generative AI.\nWe can also help executive teams level-set on what AI is and isn’t, and how to approach management. Ultimately, we help guide healthcare organizations to ensure that their AI initiative is sustainable and becomes part of their culture.\nThis article is part of HealthTech’s MonITor blog series.", "select_response": "<think>\nThe Agent initiated this search round to gather information regarding the recent collaboration between Stanford and Mayo focusing on AI in healthcare, emerging AI applications in healthcare, advancements in the field for the years 2024-2025, and significant research initiatives.

Nearly 300 attendees from Mayo Clinic and other institutions gathered in person and virtually to discuss the challenges and opportunities in applying AI technology to healthcare.\n\"As we are entering the era of artificial intelligence, AI has great potential and is already playing a critical role in revolutionizing healthcare and biomedicine,\" said Cui Tao, Ph.D., chair of Mayo Clinic's Department of Artificial Intelligence and Informatics, in her opening remarks. Dr. Tao is the Nancy Peretsman and Robert Scully Chair of AI and Informatics.\n\"Our role as a Research shield enables us to lead innovation and discovery efforts within the AI medicine ecosystem,\" adds Dr. Tao. \"Through collaborative research, we aim to drive advancements to significantly enhance healthcare outcomes.\"\nAI integrates text, radiology images, digital pathology slides, genomics and other sources of information to assist care teams in defining disease and making predictive analyses to support clinical decision-making. This \"multimodal\" AI supports healthcare teams, enhancing their ability to develop innovative solutions and improve patient care.\nDeveloping models and bridging the AI translation gap\nJohn Halamka, M.D., the Dwight and Dian Diercks President of Mayo Clinic Platform and Michael D. Brennan, M.D., President's Strategic Initiative Professor, was a keynote speaker. He emphasized the need for AI solutions to address global healthcare challenges over the next 20 years.\n\"Culturally, I think we have an imperative to build these new solutions,\" he said, noting lower birthrates, higher longevity and higher demand for healthcare in many nations. Automation and AI, he explained, can be part of those solutions, enabling healthcare that is more proactive, less costly, less invasive and more focused on wellness and cures.\nTo create solutions that benefit global populations, AI developers need access to curated, de-identified data with depth, breadth and heterogeneity, said Dr. Halamka.\nMayo Clinic hosts the largest curated, de-identified dataset in the world, he said, representing 32.5 million patients and growing. Companies such as those participating in the Mayo Clinic Platform's Accelerator program can leverage this data within a secure cloud environment to develop AI models.\nOnce developed, these models must be validated, approved by regulatory bodies and implemented so that they are easy for clinicians to use.\n\"Handing a data model and an AI model to a physician is not going to get its use and impact. It has to be fully integrated into their workflow,\" Dr. Halamka said. \"It needs to be just-in-time, there offering appropriate advice without additional effort.\"\nGetting to patients more quickly\nOther headline speakers were Shauna Overgaard, Ph.D., senior director of AI Strategy and Frameworks, and co-director of the AI Validation and Stewardship Research Program at Mayo Clinic; Thomas Fuchs, D.Sc., dean of Artificial Intelligence and Human Health at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; Anant Madabhushi, Ph.D., executive director for the Emory University Empathetic AI for Health Institute; and Hoifung Poon, general manager at Microsoft Health Futures.\nIn her keynote, Dr. Overgaard discussed the \"AI translation gap\" between proof of concept and clinical implementation. The estimated time for translating a basic science discovery to clinical practice is 17 years, she noted. \"We know that as we work toward innovation, we absolutely cannot wait 17 years.\"\nTranslating AI solutions into patient care involves overcoming challenges such as gaining clinician trust, ensuring reliability through continuous scientific validation, securing payer approval, and meeting regulatory requirements. These efforts ensure that AI tools efficiently augment and enhance healthcare professionals' expertise and patient care practices.\n\"Part of our work is identifying potential barriers to AI translation and then working together to close those barriers as well as streamline innovation,\" she said. This will require scientific rigor and multidisciplinary teamwork. Dr. Overgaard said that a solid translational process should enable stakeholders by addressing transparency, reproducibility, ethics and effectiveness.

Generative AI: a time-saving virtual assistant. With staff stretched thin, …\nContent: Dec 03, 2024 | 10 minute read\nFaced with ongoing staff shortages and growing patient demand, healthcare organizations around the world are being compelled to rethink how and where they deliver care. There is also a growing recognition of the importance of reducing the sector’s environmental impact. These 10 healthcare technology trends highlight the potential of innovation to help deliver better care to more people, in a sustainable way.\nWith staff stretched thin, healthcare leaders are turning to automation to reduce the burden on healthcare professionals. The 2024 Philips Future Health Index report showed that 92% of surveyed healthcare leaders think automation is critical for addressing staff shortages by relieving them of repetitive tasks and processes. An equal percentage believe it will save healthcare professionals time by reducing administrative work, allowing them to spend more time with patients. Generative AI has emerged as a powerful tool supporting this healthcare technology trend, promising to boost clinician productivity in ways that seemed impossible just a few years ago. It’s no wonder that 85% of healthcare leaders worldwide are already investing or plan to invest in generative AI within the next three years. We expect this trend to accelerate in 2025 as the sector continues to explore ways of gaining workflow efficiencies with generative AI. Already today, generative AI can function as a virtual assistant to save healthcare professionals valuable time, using large language models to organize clinical notes and simplify the ways patient information is communicated across teams. In areas like cancer care, generative AI could be a game-changer by summarizing vast historical reports to give care teams immediate insights into a patient’s history. It could also speed up reporting and translate complex medical information into common terms, helping to engage patients more in their own care.\nWhile AI can significantly streamline administrative tasks and improve patient engagement, its role in healthcare extends beyond automation. AI can also elevate the skills of healthcare professionals. With experienced staff in short supply in many healthcare systems around the world, AI can help simplify complex diagnostics, enabling less experienced professionals to provide high-quality care with confidence. For example, recent advances in AI have made cardiac CT easier to use, making it accessible to more facilities to increase capacity and deliver better cardiac care to more people. In addition, less experienced technicians can rely on remote consultations and expert training for virtual support and reassurance. Similarly, embedding AI in ultrasound systems allows physicians to detect, diagnose and monitor cardiac conditions more confidently and efficiently. Integrating AI into cancer treatments can also enhance patient care by addressing the increased risk of heart disease associated with therapies such as radiation and chemotherapy. Studies show that adult cancer survivors across a wide range of cancers face a 37% higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease [1]. The latest AI technologies can quickly detect signs of cardiotoxicity early in the treatment process by automating and accelerating echocardiographic measurements. Improved reproducibility and shorter study times make the process more efficient and reliable, reducing the risk of treatment delays. That’s good news for cancer patients who may otherwise face serious heart issues alongside their recovery.\nA silent revolution in surgery is marching ahead as minimally invasive procedures continue to replace traditional open surgeries. These minimally invasive procedures are transforming how providers treat cardiovascular conditions, offering patients faster recovery, reduced pain and fewer complications. With the introduction of new technologies in interventional care, minimally invasive procedures have become more advanced – but also increasingly complex. Physicians need to collect and analyze data from a wide range of sources, such as live 2D X-ray images, 3D ultrasound, Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS), and FFR or iFR physiological flow measurements, all while closely monitoring the patient. That’s why integration of systems, software and devices has become increasingly important. This integration allows interventional physicians to treat patients with greater control and confidence during every stage of minimally invasive cardiac procedures. The latest innovations in image-guided therapy also offer a unique opportunity to expand access to life-saving stroke care. Every two seconds, someone on Earth has a stroke, making it the second leading cause of death and a major cause of long-term disability. Yet less than 5% of our global population has access to mechanical thrombectomy, a minimally invasive treatment that has shown to be highly effective [2]. Expanding access by increasing the number of stroke-ready hospitals and training healthcare professionals in the latest interventional techniques is a cause that Philips is committed to, in partnership with the World Stroke Organization.\nIn critical care, time is crucial – yet always in short supply. Healthcare professionals often lose valuable time pulling patient data together from disparate sources. An open ecosystem approach to patient monitoring can help overcome this challenge by allowing data to flow freely across healthcare technology from different vendors. This creates a unified, standardized patient view that is accessible from anywhere in the hospital. In 2025, expect further advances in patient monitoring based on this open ecosystem approach to healthcare technology. Medical device integration and vendor-neutral interoperability in critical care are already helping healthcare organizations improve clinical efficiency and data accuracy, while freeing up staff to focus on providing patient-centered care. Advancing common interoperability standards with industry partners will further enhance this approach, giving systems and devices a common language to ‘speak to each other’ so that patient information can be shared even more easily. By breaking down data silos, we will also see further development of algorithms that can help care providers predict and prevent adverse patient events. We are just beginning to explore the potential of advanced analytics in critical care, using smart rules to provide care teams with actionable alerts for emerging events. In the future, AI will offer increasingly personalized recommendations by comparing the full patient picture with thousands of similar cases to help determine the best approach for each patient.\nWhile the previous four healthcare technology trends all focus on improving hospital care, there is an equally important trend that will continue to gain traction in 2025: the ongoing shift to managing health outside of the hospital. Hospital-at-home programs for patients who need acute-level care continue to be on the rise, allowing patients to receive high standards of care wherever they are, not just in hospital settings. Remote patient monitoring plays a critical role in this shift by providing healthcare professionals with real-time data to manage patient care from a distance. It has also been shown to be effective in reducing hospital readmissions for patients with chronic diseases such as congestive heart failure and is increasingly used in post-operative monitoring for early and safe patient discharge. Hospitals get to free up scarce beds for patients who need them more urgently, while patients benefit from an improved experience at home. In 2025, we will see further advances in AI and predictive analytics to support remote detection of patient health risks based on vital signs and other data. In fact, our 2024 Future Health Index report shows that remote patient monitoring is the biggest area of planned AI implementation over the next three years, with 41% of healthcare leaders intending to invest in it. This will not only help prevent complications and hospitalizations by enabling timely interventions, but also improve quality of life for patients, offering them peace of mind as they receive care in their own homes.\nThe use of virtual care soared during the COVID-19 pandemic. Today, it offers an opportunity to change how healthcare is delivered around the world by improving healthcare outcomes, particularly in resource-limited settings. Bringing care directly to patients in medically underserved communities or regions is an essential part of improving access, equity and affordability of patient care. From remote patient monitoring and point-of-care ultrasound to real-time video consultations and more, telehealth increases the potential for healthcare to reach more people, no matter where they’re located. It can also reduce the need for specialist visits, as primary care physicians can resolve 40% of issues with the help of telehealth-based specialists [3]. For example, telemedicine capabilities allow sonographers and patients based at satellite locations to connect virtually with doctors to discuss ultrasound findings in real time. These more remote locations have every capability of the main practice – without either party needing to drive several hours. Similarly, digitalization, informatics and AI are improving the quality and accessibility of obstetric care in low-income countries and underserved communities. Interpretation of images obtained through AI-enabled handheld ultrasound is no longer required by the operator, which reduces the training needed to perform the exam. Telemedicine is now being embraced around the world. For instance, healthcare providers in Indonesia – which faces unique accessibility challenges as the world’s largest country comprised solely of islands – are embracing digital health transformation to improve healthcare accessibility and quality, in line with the government’s healthcare strategy. Telemedicine, remote patient monitoring and AI are among the tools that the country will use to provide patients with care, even in remote areas.\nModern parenting has taken on a decidedly digital flavor with the integration of smart devices and apps into childcare routines. Parents now have unprecedented access to data that can help them make informed decisions and receive reassurance about their child’s overall health and well-being. In fact, there’s growing interest in AI-enabled technologies that not only provide monitoring capabilities but also deliver predictive insights about a child’s behavioral patterns. As we move into 2025, we expect an increasing number of parents – particularly first-time parents – to embrace apps and connected devices to help keep a watchful eye on their children. Our research has shown that 80% of parents in the US and 79% of parents in Europe are open to using wearables and smart technologies [4,5], demonstrating the growing desire to implement care routines based on data to support their children’s safety and health. Households are becoming more connected through the adoption of smart home systems, allowing parents to conveniently access device features such as video and audio feeds on their phones or computers. Wearables and smart devices like socks, pacifiers and trackers can provide real-time information about a child’s activities or vital signs, including respiratory patterns, body temperature and heart rate. Some AI-enabled baby monitors can help caregivers decode an infant’s cries, allowing for quicker responses to hunger and other needs. It's clear that digital health tools are transforming modern parenting in remarkable ways. And while these smart technologies aren’t a replacement for active, hands-on caregiving, these devices can offer actionable information, while also giving parents peace of mind.\nAs highlighted in several of the healthcare technology trends above, AI holds immense potential to transform healthcare, increase efficiency and improve lives. And now, AI is also starting to help improve sustainability for companies – including within healthcare technology. Healthcare accounts for 4.4% of global CO2 emissions [6] – more than either the aviation or shipping industries. AI could help analyze supply chains and identify areas for improvement, reduce waste, or improve facility management. Operational efficiencies like this are just the start. AI is also already helping to increase imaging speed, translating into lower power consumption per patient scan. How AI can be leveraged to reduce global healthcare emissions and environmental impact is an area ripe with potential for 2025 and beyond. But along with widespread adoption comes the potential for unintended consequences and significant environmental impact. There’s growing awareness of the need for sustainable innovations and AI models. Healthcare systems are now questioning how AI may be adding to their carbon footprints, while developers are concerned about improving the sustainability of the models. Why? Because digital solutions need significant energy and materials to generate, process and store data, along with water to cool heat-intensive data centers – all contributing to healthcare’s carbon footprint. In fact, the energy consumption of AI is increasing annually between 26% and 36%, and the power usage of data centers could triple within four years [7]. E-waste is another major issue to consider. Generative AI is also expected to generate up to 2.5 million tons of e-waste by 2030 [8]. As we digitalize healthcare, companies are recognizing that managing and minimizing the energy, material and water needs for AI will be essential to ensure the least impact on the environment.\nThe vast majority of healthcare’s carbon footprint – 71% – comes from supply chains through the production, transport and disposal of goods and services [9]. In fact, reducing these Scope 3 emissions is expected to have seven times more impact than just lowering a company’s own emissions. Healthcare organizations are increasingly recognizing the importance of addressing supply chain emissions not just for upcoming government regulations and reducing overall environmental impact, but also for their own financial performance. They are teaming up with partners throughout their value chains to drive change. Greater transparency and sustainable decision-making are already becoming major considerations in supply chains, from circular product design to collaborations with suppliers. According to the 2024 Future Health Index report, over the next three years, 41% of healthcare leaders plan to choose suppliers with sustainable targets and initiatives, and an equal percentage plan to implement sustainable procurement strategies, including circular equipment. Some companies like Philips are working directly with their suppliers to ensure they meet environmental standards and adopt sustainable practices. This type of responsible sourcing of goods and services can have a positive ripple effect within the entire healthcare value chain. Meanwhile, adopting circular practices, which emphasize using less, using longer, and using again, is another way that both healthcare organizations and their suppliers are significantly reducing raw material usage and waste. Refurbishment is one example. Both refurbished consumer products and refurbished medical devices, including image-guided therapy systems and MRI scanners, offer sustainable and cost-efficient alternatives without compromising performance. The refurbished medical devices market is expected to grow from $17.05 billion in 2024 to $30.78 billion by 2029 [10]. By embracing collaborative efforts, healthcare organizations can significantly reduce their environmental impact.\nAs climate change poses increasingly significant challenges, there is an urgent need for hospitals and healthcare systems to enhance their preparedness. The World Health Organization reports that climate change is already impacting health in many ways, including death and illnesses from heat waves, drought, floods, air pollution, wildfires and more [11]. Many healthcare facilities see increasing numbers of patients with climate-related health issues, yet not all are prepared to care for the influx. Issues extend beyond patient care – healthcare must also consider the impact on their own operations and facilities. In 2025, as the global conversation turns toward this topic, we expect that healthcare technology will play an important role in ensuring that the healthcare industry is equipped to handle these growing challenges. One way is through developing resilient infrastructure to ensure continuous and effective healthcare delivery, even in the face of climate disasters. This includes transitioning healthcare facilities to renewable energy sources and implementing sustainable practices to reduce their carbon footprint and operational costs. There are also opportunities for increased training and education programs to equip healthcare providers with the knowledge and skills needed to manage the influx of heat-related illnesses and vector-borne diseases. Additionally, early warning systems could enable prompt responses to minimize health risks, and strengthening community health programs can help improve preventive care and manage climate-sensitive health conditions at the local level. By embracing such initiatives, the healthcare industry can better adapt to the impacts of climate change and ensure a healthier future for all.\nSources [1] https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacc.2022.04.042 [2] https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK562154/ [3] https://hbr.org/2022/05/the-telehealth-era-is-just-beginning [4] Philips Pregnancy+ user survey, 2022 [5] Philips Pregnancy+ parents survey conducted by InSights Consulting, November 2022 [6] https://noharm-global.org/documents/health-care-climate-footprint-report [8] https://www.nature.com/articles/s43588-024-00712-6 [9] https://noharm-global.org/documents/health-care-climate-footprint-report [11] https://www.who.int/news/item/02-11-2023-climate-change-and-noncommunicable-diseases-connections", "select_response": "<think>\nThe webpage provides an overview of 10 healthcare technology trends anticipated for 2025, discussing various innovations and their implications for healthcare, including generative AI, its integration in critical areas like cardiac care, remote patient monitoring, and advancements in medical imaging.

Topics discussed include the need for industry collaboration, AI safety and security, and the importance of human connection. Speakers also emphasized how digital tools and AI support staff.\nSeveral themes echoed across the conference sessions:\n- Healthcare's most pressing challenges require platform thinking and industry-wide collaboration.\nFundamental challenges in healthcare include too much disease, increasing demand, and uneven quality across communities and countries. The industry needs easier ways to collaborate to create more cures, provide even more support to staff and make quality care more accessible. - Healthcare needs change — and platform thinking.\nThe World Health Organization estimates that there will be a shortfall of 10 million health workers by 2030. Platform thinking and emerging technologies will support the work that only healthcare workers can do, ensuring that, as demand increases, the quality of care can stay consistent. Healthcare must change, and platforms present the best opportunity to support that change. - Trust is essential for transformation.\nHealthcare professionals will only adopt AI-based solutions they can trust. AI solutions need to be mitigated for bias and validated by experts. Validation frameworks, like the ones developed by Mayo Clinic Platform_Validate, provide the evidence to establish the trustworthiness of solutions that can help teams enhance operational efficiency and improve patient care. - Mayo Clinic Platform is the model and conduit for global healthcare transformation.\nA platform model of healthcare can and will be one of Mayo Clinic's most transformative and far-reaching contributions to the future of healthcare. Industry partnerships and platform thinking will support staff and bring high-quality, personalized medicine to people everywhere — at Mayo Clinic and beyond.\nThe conference concluded with closing remarks from Dr. Halamka, who emphasized the importance of human connection and collaboration and encouraged the audience to reflect on the possibilities for the future of care.\n\"If we can start collectively delivering the care journeys and care-path planning that our patients need and want, reducing the burden on our caregivers and empowering the next generation that is not going to have enough resources, then we are finally going to change the practice of medicine,\" he said. \"The only way to do it is with platform thinking — and the only way to do it is together.\"\nNext year global leaders across the healthcare ecosystem will convene once again for PlatforMed 2025, advancing platforms for a better and fairer model of healthcare for all.", "select_response": "<think>\nThe purpose of the search round is focused on gathering information about the Stanford-Mayo partnership, specifically regarding AI applications in migraine prediction and timelines for implementation of healthcare technologies.

A new collaboration with the Mayo Clinic brings physician team — and married couple — Chieh-Ju Chao and Chia-Chun Chiang to the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI (HAI) to learn how to bridge the gap.\nImproving Treatment for Migraine Patients\nAt the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, Chia-Chun Chiang splits her medical practice between treating patients who’ve suffered acute stroke and migraine sufferers who come to her to seek help with the intense headaches that can sometimes incapacitate them for weeks, months, or longer. Chiang, a specialist in headache medicine and vascular neurology, not only hopes to improve these daily realities for her patients but also wants to explore how AI may someday lead to better overall treatment through exciting new breakthroughs.\nFor the next year, Chiang will be a visiting scholar at Stanford HAI, where she’s exploring the intersection of AI and neurology. The appointment is part of a new collaborative program between HAI and the Mayo Clinic and will give Chiang a chance to do what she’s always loved — find innovative solutions to challenging medical questions.\nBorn in Taiwan, Chiang found her medical horizons were expanded early in her career, both by her neurosurgeon father and a series of influential mentors on two continents.\n“My father always encouraged me to think not just about day-to-day realities in medical practice but about making research breakthroughs in medicine — about discovery,” she says. “Arthur Chiou, a professor of biophotonics at National Yang Ming University, opened a window for me to see different types of medical research. Later, I came to the University of California, San Diego, and met Professor Shu Chien in the department of bioengineering. He got me into the world of using math and physics to solve medical research problems. It was inspiring.”\nChiang’s time at Stanford HAI will be spent on several research projects focusing on her special interest in migraine and stroke. She hopes to use AI to help doctors determine which of many preventive migraine medications might help chronic migraine sufferers — those experiencing migraine attacks more than 15 days per month — stave off debilitating attacks.\n“Right now there’s no way to predict if a patient will respond to medication A, B, C, D, or E,” she says. “It’s a trial-and-error process, where we start with one medication and wait three months to see if it helps. This can be a long time and a long process when you’re in pain. I’m hoping to be able to apply advanced machine learning technologies to the Mayo Clinic’s established headache database to help predict good matches or to develop personalized treatment plans for patients with migraine.”\nChiang is also collaborating with Nigam Shah, a Stanford professor of medicine and chief data scientist for Stanford Health Care, to be able to more effectively utilize all of a patient’s electronic health record data to understand which migraine patients might be at risk of stroke and cardiovascular disease.\n“Things like clinician notes, consultations, and admission notes are written in free text, which traditionally have been hard for data scientists to access,” she says. “Dr. Shah’s lab has developed several advanced machine learning tools tailored to health care notes that can extract and use this sort of information. We hope to be able to apply these tools to databases at the Mayo Clinic and at Stanford to give us some solid research results from two different health care systems.”\nChiang says AI is changing the field of neurology through innovations such as telemedicine and AI-assisted CT analysis, both of which benefit stroke patients, particularly those in isolated regions of the country where small hospitals may not have neurologists on staff. Continuing the introduction of relevant and user-friendly technology into health care, however, will require improved communication between those who develop AI and those who treat patients.\n“I’m very excited about the use of AI in my field, which is why I wanted to come to HAI and contribute to this process by stimulating more discussion and work between data scientists and clinicians,” she says. “I see patients who are suffering every day in clinic. It’s crucial for us to continue imagining how AI tools can be developed to improve their quality of life.”\nDeveloping Better Tools for Echocardiography\nMayo Clinic cardiologist Chieh-Ju Chao was a teenager in Taiwan when the college entrance exam set him on a trajectory to medical school. Deep down, though, the 18-year-old harbored a secret ambition.\n“I was happy to go into medicine, but I always loved physics,” he says. “It was always in the back of my mind. I love the beauty of the laws and formulas in physics and, as a kid, I dreamed of being the next Einstein or Feynman.” After medical school, Chao took postgraduate physics courses in Taiwan before becoming a postdoctoral fellow at UC San Diego, where he led a research project to build a 3D dynamic heart model. He began to see intersections between physics and medicine, particularly in the field of cardiology. “It was one of the most important periods of my life and one that really changed my career path,” he says.\nFor the next year, Chao will have a chance to deeply explore his interdisciplinary interests, as a visiting scholar at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence. As part of a collaborative program between Stanford HAI and the Mayo Clinic, facilitated and guided by HAI Co-Director Fei-Fei Li, Chao will expand his current research on the potential use of AI technology to augment echocardiography, which harnesses ultrasound waves to examine the anatomy and dynamics of the heart. Chao hopes his dual background in medicine and technology will allow him to bridge the knowledge gap that often exists between health care and technology professionals and to accelerate the expansion of AI systems into clinical medicine at the Mayo Clinic and elsewhere.\n“The usual pathway for this has always been for clinicians to come up with an idea, then talk to AI engineers,” he says. “But that process can take a long time because communication between the two disciplines is not easy. For the first time, this program between Mayo and HAI sends clinicians out into the AI field to learn some of these skills and take them back. I knew this was something I wanted to do. I see myself as a person who will be able to speak both languages.”\nAt the Mayo Clinic, Chao studies how AI models might be used to solve clinical questions, such as how to classify different grades of cardiac diastolic dysfunction, which occur when the heart’s damaged ventricles are unable to completely fill with blood. (That work, in fact, resulted in Chao being named a “Young Investigator Award” finalist at the 2022 American College of Cardiology Conference.)\nAt Stanford HAI, he’ll focus on two primary research projects. The first will incorporate the use of AI to give cardiologists a more realistic view of the heart during procedures such as aortic and mitral valve replacements, which are often done with the use of catheters rather than open-heart surgery. Positioning these catheters currently relies on the 2D images provided by echocardiogram and X-ray. Chao envisions AI models that might be able to compile that information with CT images of the patient’s heart, giving doctors a real-time 3D and even hologram-based picture that would make the procedure smoother and more efficient.\n“Our goal is to improve success rates, minimize complications, and lessen radiation exposure through shorter procedures,” Chao says. “It could potentially shorten procedure times from five or six hours to two or three and allow a more efficient use of our procedure room resources.”\nSecondly, Chao will explore the potential use of AI visual linguistic models to generate time-consuming echocardiography reports more efficiently. Ideally, the model would have the capacity to do an initial interpretation of the study and generate a preliminary report that could then be reviewed by clinicians.\n“This would be an advancement in current AI application in the medical field,” Chao says. “People have been trying to create systems that can report on chest X-rays, which are a single image. In an echo study, we’re dealing with video clips that record the cardiac dynamics from different views. It’s an even more exciting challenge.”\nChao says he’s motivated both by colleagues at the Mayo Clinic who are enthusiastic about this work as well as the range of scholars and technical resources he’s finding at Stanford HAI.\n“It’s amazing to work with cutting-edge AI scientists and the latest technology,” he says. “Talking about my clinical ideas with colleagues here in this setting is a very different and immersive learning experience for me, and these conversations are generating new ideas as I learn about what people are doing here and about potential applications I hadn’t thought about. It’s all really exciting.”\nStanford HAI’s mission is to advance AI research, education, policy and practice to improve the human condition.

But how do leading institutions like the Mayo Clinic turn AI’s potential into real-world impact? With a strategic approach and a commitment to responsible innovation, Mayo Clinic is setting a new benchmark for how AI can enhance patient care and streamline medical workflows.\nKey speakers\n- Moderator: Gabriel Perna, Modern Healthcare’s Digital Health Editor\n- Speaker: Cris Ross, Mayo Clinic’s Former CIO\nThese insights came from our ScaleUp:AI event in November 2024, an industry-leading global conference that features topics across technologies and industries. Watch the full session below:\nKey takeaways\n- Workforce shortages: AI can help alleviate the strain by automating tasks and improving efficiency.\n- Data complexity: Healthcare generates about 30% of the world’s data, growing at an annual rate of 36%. AI helps structure this data for quality management, reimbursement, and research.\n- Patient experience: AI tools are being deployed to improve patient interactions, such as summarizing doctor visits for stressed patients who might struggle to retain information.\n- Access, affordability, and quality: AI can optimize medical workflows, reducing avoidable medical injuries and improving treatment quality.\n- Cures for complex diseases: AI is already making strides in accelerating diagnostics and treatment strategies for conditions such as atrial fibrillation and cancer.\nAddressing healthcare challenges with AI\nWorkforce shortages and data complexity\nThe healthcare industry is facing a generational shortage of professionals, which poses significant challenges for patient care. Ross emphasized that AI can help bridge this gap by taking on administrative and repetitive tasks, allowing medical professionals to focus on patient interactions and complex decision-making.\n“We have a generational shortage of healthcare professionals.”\n“We have a generational shortage of healthcare professionals,” Ross explained. “AI has some challenges in other industries from an ethical perspective on reduction in jobs, but look, if it can do the jobs of people in healthcare, it’s a hero job.”\nAt the same time, healthcare is one of the most data-intensive industries, with an estimated 30% of the world’s healthcare-related data. This data grows at a staggering 36% annual rate, presenting both challenges and opportunities for AI.\n“Doctors want to have conversations with patients,” Ross said. “So what can we do to improve the patient experience by using AI tools to be explainers, so patients can ask questions of a record and have a computer answer in a sensible way, where doctors don’t have time to answer those questions.”\nEnhancing patient experience and healthcare accessibility\nThe stress and confusion that often accompany medical visits make it difficult for patients to absorb and retain crucial health information. AI tools can improve patient experiences by summarizing doctor visits and providing personalized explanations.\nAdditionally, quality healthcare remains out of reach for many due to accessibility and affordability issues. AI is being used to improve workflow efficiencies, streamline diagnoses, and enhance decision-making to reduce costs and increase care quality.\n“We still have tens of thousands of people who are injured every year in the U.S. from medical injury that’s avoidable. So there’s all sorts of things we can do to improve.” Ross noted. AI can help reduce these errors, ensure more efficient triage, and make scheduling and operational management more effective.\nAdvancing treatments and accelerating disease detection\nAI is accelerating disease detection and treatment breakthroughs, particularly in areas like arrhythmia detection, cancer treatment, and transplant matching.\n“Some of the stuff that we’ve done in Mayo is, for instance, detection of arrhythmias,” Ross explained. “We’re at the point where the rhythms can be detected on a single lead ECG, meaning something that can be in an Apple watch or some other device. From that, we can both diagnose arrhythmias and treat them. So when a patient goes into arrhythmia, you can take interventions to get them back into rhythm.”\nHe also highlighted Mayo Clinic’s work with Google on radiotherapy optimization: “We worked with Google to develop algorithms to do better radiotherapy treatment of disease, and we started with head and neck cancers.” With AI-powered radiotherapy, AI can maximize tumor targeting while minimizing damage to surrounding tissue, potentially transforming cancer treatment outcomes.\nAI at scale: Mayo Clinic’s enterprise-wide approach\nUnlike many healthcare institutions that focus on isolated AI projects, Mayo Clinic has developed an enterprise-wide AI strategy:\nData consolidation: Over a decade, Mayo Clinic unified its electronic health records into a single system, creating a comprehensive, structured patient database.\nAI factory: Hosted on Google Cloud’s Vertex AI, Mayo Clinic’s AI factory supports over 250 AI research and deployment projects, integrating models with real-time patient data.\nCloud app factory: Ensuring AI models can be deployed efficiently within workflows, bridging the gap between innovation and clinical application.\n“We have two jobs: One is to support technology for the world’s best hospital.
