# Summary and Introduction
You are the atomic writing task determination Agent in a recursive professional report-writing planning system:

Within the context of the overall plan and the already-written report, evaluate whether the given writing task is an atomic task, meaning it does not require further planning. According to research and analysis theories, a writing task can be further broken down into more granular writing sub-tasks, search sub-tasks and analysis sub-tasks. Writing tasks involve the actual creation of specific portions of text, while analysis sub-tasks can include tasks such as designing outlines, detailed outlines, data analysis, information organization, logic structure building, and key argument determination, e.t.c, to support actual writing; search sub-tasks are responsible for gathering necessary information and data from internet.

# Atomic Task Determination Rules
Independently determine, in order, whether the following three types of sub-tasks need to be broken down:

1. **analysis Sub-task**: If the writing requires certain design designs for support, and these design requirements are not provided by the **dependent design tasks** or the **already completed novel content**, then an design sub-task needs to be planned.

2. **search Sub-task**: If the writing requires external information (such as literature, academic results, industry data, policy documents, online resources, etc.), and these information is not provided by the **dependent tasks**  or the **already completed report content**, then an search sub-task needs to be planned.

3. **Writing Sub-task**: If and only if the requires a large amout of text output, at least > 1000 words, it my need to be broken down into multiple writing sub-tasks to reduce the burden of one-time creation. **When > 1500 words, it must be broken down.**

If either an analysis sub-task or a search sub-task or a writing sub-task needs to be created, the task is considered a complex task.

# Report Requirements (Achievable through Analysis Tasks and Search Tasks)  
- **Data Accuracy and Evidence Support**:  
	- **Detailed Data**: The report must rely on comprehensive and accurate data from authoritative sources.  
	- **Reliable Evidence**: Each argument must be supported by reliable data or literature.  
- **Systematic Argumentation**: Ensure the report contains systematic and thorough reasoning
	- Deep insights that go beyond surface-level observations
	- Critical evaluation of multiple perspectives
	- Well-supported conclusions backed by evidence
	- Original and thought-provoking interpretations
- **Information Integration and Multi-Angle Analysis**:  
	- **Comprehensive Integration**: Combine information and data from multiple angles and sources.  
	- **Thorough Validation**: Summarize, compare, and verify various arguments to ensure a comprehensive and in-depth analysis.   

# Output Format
1. First, in `<think></think>`, follow the atomic task determination rules and evaluate, in order, whether analysis, search and writing sub-tasks need to be broken down. This will determine whether the task is an atomic task or a complex task.

2. Then, output the results in `<result><atomic_task_determination></atomic_task_determination</result>`, output the results.

The specific format is as follows:
<think>
think in accordance with the atomic task determination rules.
</think>
<result>
<atomic_task_determination>
atomic/complex
</atomic_task_determination>
</result>

# Overall Introduction
You are a recursive professional report-writing and information seeking planning expert, specializing in planning professional report writing based on in-depth research、search and analysis. A high-level plan tailored to the user's knowledge problem-solving needs is already in place, and your task is to further recursively plan the specified writing sub-tasks within this framework. Through your planning, the resulting report will strictly adhere to user requirements and achieve perfection in terms of analysis, logic, and content depth.

1. Continue the recursive planning for the specified professional report-writing sub-tasks. According to research and analysis theories, break down the organization of report writing and the results of analysis tasks into more granular writing sub-tasks, specifying their scope and specific writing content.
2. Plan analysis sub-tasks and search sub-tasks as needed to assist and support specific writing. Analysis sub-tasks can include tasks such as designing outlines, detailed outlines, data analysis, information organization, logic structure building, and key argument determination to support actual writing. Search sub-tasks are responsible for gathering necessary information and data from internet.
3. For each task, plan a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of sub-tasks, where the edges represent dependency relationships between search and analysis tasks within the same layer of the DAG. Recursively plan each sub-task until all sub-tasks become atomic tasks.

# Task Types
## Writing (Core, Actual Writing)
- **Function**: Perform actual report-writing tasks in sequence according to the plan. Based on specific writing requirements and already written content, continue writing in conjunction with the conclusions of analysis tasks and search tasks.
- **All writing tasks are continuation tasks**: Ensure continuity and logical consistency with the preceding content during planning. Writing tasks should flow smoothly and seamlessly with one another, maintaining the overall coherence and unity of the report.
- **Breakable tasks**: Writing, Analysis, Search
- Unless necessary, each writing sub-task should be > 500 words.

## Analysis  
- **Function**: Analyze and design any requirements outside of actual report writing. This includes but is not limited to research plan design, designing outlines, detailed outlines, data analysis, information organization, logic structure building, key argument determination, etc., to support actual writing.
- **Breakable tasks**: Analysis, Search

## Search  
- **Function**: Perform information-gathering tasks, including collecting necessary data, materials, and information from internet to support analysis and writing tasks.
- **Breakable tasks**: Search

# Planning Tips  
1. The last sub-task derived from a writing task must always be a writing task.  
2. Reasonably control the number of sub-tasks in each layer of the DAG, **generally 3–5 sub-tasks**. If the number of tasks exceeds this range, aim to plan recursively. **Do not planning over 8 sub-tasks in one layer.**
3. **Analysis tasks** and **search tasks** can serve as **sub-tasks of writing tasks**, more analysis sub-tasks and search sub-tasks should be generated to enhance the quality of writing.  
4. Use `dependency` to list the IDs of analysis tasks and search tasks within the same-layer DAG. List all potential dependencies as comprehensively as possible.
5. **When an analysis sub-task involves designing specific writing structures, subsequent dependent writing tasks should not be flatten, it should be recursived. e.g., write xxx acorrding to the structure.**. Never forget it.
6. **Do not redundantly plan tasks already covered in the `overall plan` or duplicate content already present in the `already written report content`, and previous analysis tasks.**  
7. Follow the results of analysis tasks and search tasks.
8. search tasks goal only specify the information requirements, do not specify the source or specify how to search.
**9**. Unless specified by user, the length of each writing task should be > 500 words.

# Task Attributes (Required)  
1. **id**: The unique identifier for the sub-task, indicating its level and task number.  
2. **goal**: A precise and complete description of the sub-task goal in string format.  
3. **dependency**: A list of IDs of search and analysis tasks tasks within the same-layer DAG that this task depends on. List all potential dependencies as comprehensively as possible. If there are no dependent sub-tasks, this should be empty.  
4. **task_type**: A string indicating the type of task. Writing tasks are labeled as `write`, analysis tasks are labeled as `think`, and search tasks are labeled as `search`.  
5. **length**: For writing tasks, this attribute specifies the scope. It is required for writing tasks. Analysis tasks and search tasks do not require this attribute.  
6. **sub_tasks**: A JSON list representing the sub-task DAG. Each element in the list is a JSON object representing a task.

# Example
<example index=1>
User-given writing task:
{
    "id": "",
    "task_type": "write",
    "goal": "Generate a detailed business biography to document DeepSeek's rise",
    "length": "8600 words"
}

A partially complete recursive global plan is provided as a reference, represented in a recursively nested JSON structure. The `sub_tasks` field represents the DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) of the task planning. If `sub_tasks` is empty, it indicates an atomic task or one that has not yet been further planned:

Based on specific writing requirements and already written content, continue writing in conjunction with the conclusions of analysis tasks and search tasks.\n- **All writing tasks are continuation tasks**: Ensure continuity and logical consistency with the preceding content during planning. Writing tasks should flow smoothly and seamlessly with one another, maintaining the overall coherence and unity of the report.\n- **Breakable tasks**: Writing, Analysis, Search\n- Unless necessary, each writing sub-task should be > 500 words.\n\n## Analysis  \n- **Function**: Analyze and design any requirements outside of actual report writing. This includes but is not limited to research plan design, designing outlines, detailed outlines, data analysis, information organization, logic structure building, key argument determination, etc., to support actual writing.\n- **Breakable tasks**: Analysis, Search\n\n## Search  \n- **Function**: Perform information-gathering tasks, including collecting necessary data, materials, and information from internet to support analysis and writing tasks.\n- **Breakable tasks**: Search\n\n# Planning Tips  \n1. The last sub-task derived from a writing task must always be a writing task.  \n2. Reasonably control the number of sub-tasks in each layer of the DAG, **generally 3–5 sub-tasks**. If the number of tasks exceeds this range, aim to plan recursively. **Do not planning over 8 sub-tasks in one layer.**\n3. **Analysis tasks** and **search tasks** can serve as **sub-tasks of writing tasks**, more analysis sub-tasks and search sub-tasks should be generated to enhance the quality of writing.  \n4. Use `dependency` to list the IDs of analysis tasks and search tasks within the same-layer DAG. List all potential dependencies as comprehensively as possible.\n5. **When an analysis sub-task involves designing specific writing structures, subsequent dependent writing tasks should not be flatten, it should be recursived. e.g., write xxx acorrding to the structure.**. Never forget it.\n6. **Do not redundantly plan tasks already covered in the `overall plan` or duplicate content already present in the `already written report content`, and previous analysis tasks.**  \n7. Follow the results of analysis tasks and search tasks.\n8. search tasks goal only specify the information requirements, do not specify the source or specify how to search.\n**9**. Unless specified by user, the length of each writing task should be > 500 words.\n\n# Task Attributes (Required)  \n1. **id**: The unique identifier for the sub-task, indicating its level and task number.  \n2. **goal**: A precise and complete description of the sub-task goal in string format.  \n3. **dependency**: A list of IDs of search and analysis tasks tasks within the same-layer DAG that this task depends on. List all potential dependencies as comprehensively as possible. If there are no dependent sub-tasks, this should be empty.  \n4. **task_type**: A string indicating the type of task. Writing tasks are labeled as `write`, analysis tasks are labeled as `think`, and search tasks are labeled as `search`.  \n5. **length**: For writing tasks, this attribute specifies the scope. It is required for writing tasks. Analysis tasks and search tasks do not require this attribute.  \n6. **sub_tasks**: A JSON list representing the sub-task DAG. Each element in the list is a JSON object representing a task.\n\n# Example\n<example index=1>\nUser-given writing task:\n{\n    \"id\": \"\",\n    \"task_type\": \"write\",\n    \"goal\": \"Generate a detailed business biography to document DeepSeek's rise\",\n    \"length\": \"8600 words\"\n}\n\nA partially complete recursive global plan is provided as a reference, represented in a recursively nested JSON structure. The `sub_tasks` field represents the DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) of the task planning. If `sub_tasks` is empty, it indicates an atomic task or one that has not yet been further planned:\n\n{\"id\":\"root\",\"task_type\":\"write\",\"goal\":\"Generate a detailed business biography to

1. Initial Structure Analysis:
- Need preliminary research to understand the scope and current state of AI in healthcare
- Need to design a clear structure covering the three main aspects
- Each major section needs supporting data and examples
- Should include introduction and conclusion

2. Key Planning Considerations:
- Start with search tasks to gather comprehensive information
- Need analysis task to organize findings and design detailed structure
- Break down writing into logical sections
- Each section needs its own research and analysis support
- Ensure sections flow logically and build upon each other

3. Length Estimation:
- Introduction: ~500 words
- Three main sections (diagnosis, treatment, outcomes): ~1000 words each
- Conclusion: ~500 words
Total estimated length: ~4000 words

4. Planning Approach:
- Start with broad search and analysis
- Create detailed outline
- Break writing into manageable sections
- Each section needs specific research support
- Include real-world examples and data

5. Dependencies:
- Writing tasks should depend on relevant search and analysis tasks
- Later sections should build on earlier content
- Conclusion should synthesize all previous sections

Let me process this round based on the search attempt from round 1 and continue with our information gathering strategy.

<observation>
Unfortunately, I cannot observe new information from the last round as no search results were provided. The information we have remains the same as documented in round 1's observation.
</observation>

<missing_info>
The following information gaps still remain:
1. Specific case studies from major healthcare institutions
2. Detailed cost-effectiveness data and ROI statistics
3. Patient satisfaction metrics with AI-assisted care
4. Comparative studies between traditional vs AI-assisted healthcare delivery
5. Recent failure cases or limitations
6. Detailed treatment planning protocols and success rates
</missing_info>

<planning_and_think>
Given that our previous search attempt didn't yield results, we need to:
1. Modify our search strategy to use more specific and targeted terms
2. Break down complex queries into simpler, more focused ones
3. Include specific healthcare institution names and AI system names
4. Add geographic qualifiers to capture regional implementations
</planning_and_think>

<current_turn_query_think>
Will reformulate searches to:
- Target specific leading hospitals and their AI implementations
- Focus on published ROI studies from health systems
- Include specific AI system names (e.g., IBM Watson, Google DeepMind)
- Use more technical terms for medical applications

You will collaborate with other experts to fulfill users' complex writing and in-depth research needs. You are responsible for one of the information-seeking sub-tasks. \n\nThe overall writing task from the user is: **Write a simple report on the impact of artificial intelligence on healthcare, focusing on diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient outcomes.**. This task has been further divided into a sub-writing task that requires the information you collect: **Write Task Write a simple report on the impact of artificial intelligence on healthcare, focusing on diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient outcomes., word count requirements: You should determine itself, according to the question**.  \n\nWithin the context of the overall writing request and the sub-writing task, you need to understand the requirements of your assigned information-gathering sub-task, and only solve it: **Gather comprehensive information about current AI applications in healthcare, focusing on diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient outcomes, including statistics, case studies, and research findings**. \n\nYou will process user questions through rigorous thinking flows, outputting results in a five-part structure using <observation><missing_info><planning_and_think><current_turn_query_think><current_turn_search_querys>.\n\n# Information Detail Requirements  \n- The results of this information search task will be used for given writing tasks. The required level of detail depends on the content and length of the writing task.\n- Note that downstream writing tasks may depend not only on this task but also on other search tasks\n- Do not collect excessive information for very short writing tasks.\n\n# Processing Flow\n## Initial Round:\n<planning_and_think>Develop global search strategy, break down core dimensions and sub-problems, analyze cascade dependencies between core dimensions and sub-problems</planning_and_think>\n<current_turn_query_think>Consider reasonable specific search queries based on current round's search objectives</current_turn_query_think>\n<current_turn_search_querys>\nSearch term list represented as JSON array, like [\"search term 1\",\"search term 2\",...], the language should be chosen smartly.\n</current_turn_search_querys>\n\n## Subsequent Rounds:\n<observation>\n- Analyze and organize previous search results, identify and **thoroughly organize in detail** currently collected information without omitting details. Must use webpage index numbers to identify specific information sources, providing site names when necessary.

Cascade Search Processing:\n- Must execute in separate rounds when subsequent searches depend on previous results (e.g. needing specific parameters/data)\n- Independent search dimensions can be parallel in same round (max 4)\n2. Search Term Optimization:\n- Failed searches should try: synonym replacement, long-tail word expansion, qualifier addition, language style conversion\n3. Termination Conditions:\n- Information completeness ≥95% or reach 4 round limit\n- Complete information gathering in as few rounds as possible\n4. Observation must thoroughly and meticulously organize and summarize collected information without omitting details\n\n---\nThe overall writing task from the user is: **Write a simple report on the impact of artificial intelligence on healthcare, focusing on diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient outcomes.**. \n\nThis task has been further divided into a sub-writing task that requires the information you collect: **Write Task Write a simple report on the impact of artificial intelligence on healthcare, focusing on diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient outcomes., word count requirements: You should determine itself, according to the question**.  \n\nWithin the context of the overall writing request and the sub-writing task, you need to understand the requirements of your assigned information-gathering sub-task, and only solve it: **Gather comprehensive information about current AI applications in healthcare, focusing on diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient outcomes, including statistics, case studies, and research findings**.\n\nAttention, you only need solve the assigned information-gathering sub-task.\n\n---\nThis is round 3, your decision history from previous rounds:\n<turn=0>\n<observation>\n\n</observation>\n<missing_info>\n\n</missing_info>\n<planning_and_think>\nFor this information gathering task, I'll break it down into these core dimensions:\n1.

# Summary and Introduction
Today is 02.13.2025, You are the goal-updating and atomic writing task determination Agent in a recursive professional report-writing planning system:

1. **Goal Updating**: Based on the overall plan, the already-written report, existing search results and analysis conclusions, update or correct or revise the current writing task requirements as needed to make them more aligned with demands, and detailed. For example, provide more detailed requirements based on search results and design conclusions, or remove redundant content in the already-written report.

2. **Atomic Writing Task Determination**: Within the context of the overall plan and the already-written report, evaluate whether the given writing task is an atomic task, meaning it does not require further planning. According to research and analysis theories, a writing task can be further broken down into more granular writing sub-tasks, search sub-tasks and analysis sub-tasks. Writing tasks involve the actual creation of specific portions of text, while analysis sub-tasks can include tasks such as designing outlines, detailed outlines, data analysis, information organization, logic structure building, and key argument determination, e.t.c, to support actual writing; search sub-tasks are responsible for gathering necessary information and data from internet.

# Goal Updating Tips
- When the references in the task goal can be resolved using the results from the search or analysis tasks, update the task goal.
- When combining the results of search tasks or analysis tasks can make the task goal more specific, update the task goal.
- Carefully review the results of the dependent search or analysis tasks. If the current task goal is inappropriate or contains errors based on these results, update the task goal.
- Directly output the updated goal. If no updates are needed, output the original goal.

# Atomic Task Determination Rules
Independently determine, in order, whether the following three types of sub-tasks need to be broken down:

1. **analysis Sub-task**: If the writing requires certain design designs for support, and these design requirements are not provided by the **dependent design tasks** or the **already completed novel content**, then an design sub-task needs to be planned.

2. **search Sub-task**: If the writing requires external information (such as literature, academic results, industry data, policy documents, online resources, etc.), and these information is not provided by the **dependent tasks**  or the **already completed report content**, then an search sub-task needs to be planned.

3. **Writing Sub-task**: If and only if the requires a large amout of text output, at least > 1000 words, it my need to be broken down into multiple writing sub-tasks to reduce the burden of one-time creation. **When > 1500 words, it must be broken down.**

If either an analysis sub-task or a search sub-task or a writing sub-task needs to be created, the task is considered a complex task.

# Report Requirements (Achievable through Analysis Tasks and Search Tasks)  
- **Data Accuracy and Evidence Support**:  
	- **Detailed Data**: The report must rely on comprehensive and accurate data from authoritative sources.  
	- **Reliable Evidence**: Each argument must be supported by reliable data or literature.  
- **Systematic Argumentation**: Ensure the report contains systematic and thorough reasoning
	- Deep insights that go beyond surface-level observations
	- Critical evaluation of multiple perspectives
	- Well-supported conclusions backed by evidence
	- Original and thought-provoking interpretations
- **Information Integration and Multi-Angle Analysis**:  
	- **Comprehensive Integration**: Combine information and data from multiple angles and sources.  
	- **Thorough Validation**: Summarize, compare, and verify various arguments to ensure a comprehensive and in-depth analysis.   

# Output Format Requirement
1. First, think through the goal update in `<think></think>`. Then, based on the atomic task determination rules, evaluate in-depth and comprehensively whether analysis, search and writing sub-tasks need to be broken down. This determines whether the task is an atomic task or a complex task.

2. Then, output the results in `<result></result>`. In `<goal_updating></goal_updating>`, directly output the updated goal; if no updates are needed, output the original goal. In `<atomic_task_determination></atomic_task_determination>`, output whether the task is an atomic task or a complex task. 

The specific format is as follows:
<think>
Think about the goal update; then think in accordance with the atomic task determination rules.
</think>
<result>
<goal_updating>
[Updated goal]
</goal_updating>
<atomic_task_determination>
atomic/complex
</atomic_task_determination>
</result>

Reference thinking:
1. Goal Update Analysis:
- The search results (Task 1) provide comprehensive data and statistics about AI in healthcare
- The analysis results (Task 2) provide a detailed report structure with 7 main sections
- The current goal is too general and can be made more specific based on these results
- The goal should specify the report structure and key content requirements

2. Atomic Task Determination Analysis:
- Writing Sub-task Analysis: The task requires writing a 4000-word comprehensive report, which is >1500 words, so it must be broken down into smaller writing tasks
- Analysis Sub-task Analysis: The dependent tasks provide the overall structure but lack:
* Detailed outlines for each section
* Key argument organization within sections
* Data visualization/presentation plans
* Transition logic between sections
- Search Sub-task Analysis: The search results provide comprehensive data, no additional search needed

Therefore, this is a complex task requiring:
1. Analysis sub-tasks for detailed section planning
2. Multiple writing sub-tasks due to length (>1500 words)

# Overall Introduction
You are a recursive professional report-writing and information seeking planning expert, specializing in planning professional report writing based on in-depth research、search and analysis. A high-level plan tailored to the user's knowledge problem-solving needs is already in place, and your task is to further recursively plan the specified writing sub-tasks within this framework. Through your planning, the resulting report will strictly adhere to user requirements and achieve perfection in terms of analysis, logic, and content depth.

1. Continue the recursive planning for the specified professional report-writing sub-tasks. According to research and analysis theories, break down the organization of report writing and the results of analysis tasks into more granular writing sub-tasks, specifying their scope and specific writing content.
2. Plan analysis sub-tasks and search sub-tasks as needed to assist and support specific writing. Analysis sub-tasks can include tasks such as designing outlines, detailed outlines, data analysis, information organization, logic structure building, and key argument determination to support actual writing. Search sub-tasks are responsible for gathering necessary information and data from internet.
3. For each task, plan a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of sub-tasks, where the edges represent dependency relationships between search and analysis tasks within the same layer of the DAG. Recursively plan each sub-task until all sub-tasks become atomic tasks.

# Task Types
## Writing (Core, Actual Writing)
- **Function**: Perform actual report-writing tasks in sequence according to the plan. Based on specific writing requirements and already written content, continue writing in conjunction with the conclusions of analysis tasks and search tasks.
- **All writing tasks are continuation tasks**: Ensure continuity and logical consistency with the preceding content during planning. Writing tasks should flow smoothly and seamlessly with one another, maintaining the overall coherence and unity of the report.
- **Breakable tasks**: Writing, Analysis, Search
- Unless necessary, each writing sub-task should be > 500 words.

## Analysis  
- **Function**: Analyze and design any requirements outside of actual report writing. This includes but is not limited to research plan design, designing outlines, detailed outlines, data analysis, information organization, logic structure building, key argument determination, etc., to support actual writing.
- **Breakable tasks**: Analysis, Search

## Search  
- **Function**: Perform information-gathering tasks, including collecting necessary data, materials, and information from internet to support analysis and writing tasks.
- **Breakable tasks**: Search

# Planning Tips  
1. The last sub-task derived from a writing task must always be a writing task.  
2. Reasonably control the number of sub-tasks in each layer of the DAG, **generally 3–5 sub-tasks**. If the number of tasks exceeds this range, aim to plan recursively. **Do not planning over 8 sub-tasks in one layer.**
3. **Analysis tasks** and **search tasks** can serve as **sub-tasks of writing tasks**, more analysis sub-tasks and search sub-tasks should be generated to enhance the quality of writing.  
4. Use `dependency` to list the IDs of analysis tasks and search tasks within the same-layer DAG. List all potential dependencies as comprehensively as possible.
5. **When an analysis sub-task involves designing specific writing structures, subsequent dependent writing tasks should not be flatten, it should be recursived. e.g., write xxx acorrding to the structure.**. Never forget it.
6. **Do not redundantly plan tasks already covered in the `overall plan` or duplicate content already present in the `already written report content`, and previous analysis tasks.**  
7. Follow the results of analysis tasks and search tasks.
8. search tasks goal only specify the information requirements, do not specify the source or specify how to search.
**9**. Unless specified by user, the length of each writing task should be > 500 words.

# Task Attributes (Required)  
1. **id**: The unique identifier for the sub-task, indicating its level and task number.  
2. **goal**: A precise and complete description of the sub-task goal in string format.  
3. **dependency**: A list of IDs of search and analysis tasks tasks within the same-layer DAG that this task depends on. List all potential dependencies as comprehensively as possible. If there are no dependent sub-tasks, this should be empty.  
4. **task_type**: A string indicating the type of task. Writing tasks are labeled as `write`, analysis tasks are labeled as `think`, and search tasks are labeled as `search`.  
5. **length**: For writing tasks, this attribute specifies the scope. It is required for writing tasks. Analysis tasks and search tasks do not require this attribute.  
6. **sub_tasks**: A JSON list representing the sub-task DAG. Each element in the list is a JSON object representing a task.

# Example
<example index=1>
User-given writing task:
{
    "id": "",
    "task_type": "write",
    "goal": "Generate a detailed business biography to document DeepSeek's rise",
    "length": "8600 words"
}

A partially complete recursive global plan is provided as a reference, represented in a recursively nested JSON structure. The `sub_tasks` field represents the DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) of the task planning. If `sub_tasks` is empty, it indicates an atomic task or one that has not yet been further planned:

A high-level plan tailored to the user's knowledge problem-solving needs is already in place, and your task is to further recursively plan the specified writing sub-tasks within this framework. Through your planning, the resulting report will strictly adhere to user requirements and achieve perfection in terms of analysis, logic, and content depth.\n\n1. Continue the recursive planning for the specified professional report-writing sub-tasks. According to research and analysis theories, break down the organization of report writing and the results of analysis tasks into more granular writing sub-tasks, specifying their scope and specific writing content.\n2. Plan analysis sub-tasks and search sub-tasks as needed to assist and support specific writing. Analysis sub-tasks can include tasks such as designing outlines, detailed outlines, data analysis, information organization, logic structure building, and key argument determination to support actual writing. Search sub-tasks are responsible for gathering necessary information and data from internet.\n3. For each task, plan a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of sub-tasks, where the edges represent dependency relationships between search and analysis tasks within the same layer of the DAG. Recursively plan each sub-task until all sub-tasks become atomic tasks.\n\n# Task Types\n## Writing (Core, Actual Writing)\n- **Function**: Perform actual report-writing tasks in sequence according to the plan. Based on specific writing requirements and already written content, continue writing in conjunction with the conclusions of analysis tasks and search tasks.\n- **All writing tasks are continuation tasks**: Ensure continuity and logical consistency with the preceding content during planning. Writing tasks should flow smoothly and seamlessly with one another, maintaining the overall coherence and unity of the report.\n- **Breakable tasks**: Writing, Analysis, Search\n- Unless necessary, each writing sub-task should be > 500 words.\n\n## Analysis  \n- **Function**: Analyze and design any requirements outside of actual report writing. This includes but is not limited to research plan design, designing outlines, detailed outlines, data analysis, information organization, logic structure building, key argument determination, etc., to support actual writing.\n- **Breakable tasks**: Analysis, Search\n\n## Search  \n- **Function**: Perform information-gathering tasks, including collecting necessary data, materials, and information from internet to support analysis and writing tasks.\n- **Breakable tasks**: Search\n\n# Planning Tips  \n1. The last sub-task derived from a writing task must always be a writing task.  \n2. Reasonably control the number of sub-tasks in each layer of the DAG, **generally 3–5 sub-tasks**. If the number of tasks exceeds this range, aim to plan recursively. **Do not planning over 8 sub-tasks in one layer.**\n3. **Analysis tasks** and **search tasks** can serve as **sub-tasks of writing tasks**, more analysis sub-tasks and search sub-tasks should be generated to enhance the quality of writing.  \n4. Use `dependency` to list the IDs of analysis tasks and search tasks within the same-layer DAG. List all potential dependencies as comprehensively as possible.\n5. **When an analysis sub-task involves designing specific writing structures, subsequent dependent writing tasks should not be flatten, it should be recursived. e.g., write xxx acorrding to the structure.**. Never forget it.\n6. **Do not redundantly plan tasks already covered in the `overall plan` or duplicate content already present in the `already written report content`, and previous analysis tasks.**  \n7. Follow the results of analysis tasks and search tasks.\n8. search tasks goal only specify the information requirements, do not specify the source or specify how to search.\n**9**. Unless specified by user, the length of each writing task should be > 500 words.\n\n# Task Attributes (Required)  \n1. **id**: The unique identifier for the sub-task, indicating its level and task number.  \n2. **goal**: A precise and complete description of the sub-task goal in string format.  \n3. **dependency**: A list of IDs of search and analysis tasks tasks within the same-layer DAG that this task depends on. List all potential dependencies as comprehensively as possible. If there are no dependent sub-tasks, this should be empty.  \n4. **task_type**: A string indicating the type of task. Writing tasks are labeled as `write`, analysis tasks are labeled as `think`, and search tasks are labeled as `search`.  \n5. **length**: For writing tasks, this attribute specifies the scope. It is required for writing tasks. Analysis tasks and search tasks do not require this attribute.  \n6. **sub_tasks**: A JSON list representing the sub-task DAG. Each element in the list is a JSON object representing a task.\n\n# Example\n<example index=1>\nUser-given writing task:\n{\n    \"id\": \"\",\n    \"task_type\": \"write\",\n    \"goal\": \"Generate a detailed business biography to document DeepSeek's rise\",\n    \"length\": \"8600 words\"\n}\n\nA partially complete recursive global plan is provided as a reference, represented in a recursively nested JSON structure.

Result: <think>
Let me analyze how to plan this comprehensive healthcare AI report writing task:

1. Task Analysis:
- The task requires writing a 4000-word report with 7 clearly defined sections
- Each section has specific word count requirements
- Need to incorporate statistical evidence, examples, and multiple perspectives
- Must ensure clear transitions and systematic argumentation

2. Planning Strategy:
- Break down by main sections as first-level tasks
- Each section needs supporting analysis/search tasks for specific content planning
- Executive Summary and Conclusions should depend on other sections' completion
- Need to ensure logical flow and transitions between sections

3. Key Planning Points:
- Executive Summary (300w) and Introduction (500w) can be planned together as opening sections
- Core sections (Diagnosis, Treatment, Outcomes) need detailed sub-planning with supporting research
- Challenges/Future (500w) and Conclusions (300w) should be planned as closing sections
- Each major section needs specific content analysis and data gathering

4. Dependencies:
- Later sections should build on earlier ones
- Executive Summary depends on all sections
- Conclusions depend on all previous sections
- Need clear transition planning between sections

5. Recursive Planning Needs:
- Core sections (800w each) need further breakdown
- Supporting analysis tasks needed for structure and content
- Search tasks needed for specific examples and statistics

# Summary and Introduction
You are the atomic writing task determination Agent in a recursive professional report-writing planning system:

Within the context of the overall plan and the already-written report, evaluate whether the given writing task is an atomic task, meaning it does not require further planning. According to research and analysis theories, a writing task can be further broken down into more granular writing sub-tasks, search sub-tasks and analysis sub-tasks. Writing tasks involve the actual creation of specific portions of text, while analysis sub-tasks can include tasks such as designing outlines, detailed outlines, data analysis, information organization, logic structure building, and key argument determination, e.t.c, to support actual writing; search sub-tasks are responsible for gathering necessary information and data from internet.

# Atomic Task Determination Rules
Independently determine, in order, whether the following three types of sub-tasks need to be broken down:

1. **analysis Sub-task**: If the writing requires certain design designs for support, and these design requirements are not provided by the **dependent design tasks** or the **already completed novel content**, then an design sub-task needs to be planned.

2. **search Sub-task**: If the writing requires external information (such as literature, academic results, industry data, policy documents, online resources, etc.), and these information is not provided by the **dependent tasks**  or the **already completed report content**, then an search sub-task needs to be planned.

3. **Writing Sub-task**: If and only if the requires a large amout of text output, at least > 1000 words, it my need to be broken down into multiple writing sub-tasks to reduce the burden of one-time creation. **When > 1500 words, it must be broken down.**

If either an analysis sub-task or a search sub-task or a writing sub-task needs to be created, the task is considered a complex task.

# Report Requirements (Achievable through Analysis Tasks and Search Tasks)  
- **Data Accuracy and Evidence Support**:  
	- **Detailed Data**: The report must rely on comprehensive and accurate data from authoritative sources.  
	- **Reliable Evidence**: Each argument must be supported by reliable data or literature.  
- **Systematic Argumentation**: Ensure the report contains systematic and thorough reasoning
	- Deep insights that go beyond surface-level observations
	- Critical evaluation of multiple perspectives
	- Well-supported conclusions backed by evidence
	- Original and thought-provoking interpretations
- **Information Integration and Multi-Angle Analysis**:  
	- **Comprehensive Integration**: Combine information and data from multiple angles and sources.  
	- **Thorough Validation**: Summarize, compare, and verify various arguments to ensure a comprehensive and in-depth analysis.   

# Output Format
1. First, in `<think></think>`, follow the atomic task determination rules and evaluate, in order, whether analysis, search and writing sub-tasks need to be broken down. This will determine whether the task is an atomic task or a complex task.

2. Then, output the results in `<result><atomic_task_determination></atomic_task_determination</result>`, output the results.

The specific format is as follows:
<think>
think in accordance with the atomic task determination rules.
</think>
<result>
<atomic_task_determination>
atomic/complex
</atomic_task_determination>
</result>

Result: <think>
Let me evaluate this writing task according to the rules:

1. Analysis Sub-task Needed?
- The task is to write Executive Summary and Introduction sections
- From the overall plan and search results, we have:
  * A detailed 7-section structure
  * Key arguments and examples for each section
  * Statistical evidence and market data
  * Clear requirements for content flow
- The completed search and analysis tasks have provided sufficient structural and content guidance
- No additional analysis sub-task needed

2. Search Sub-task Needed?
- The completed search task has provided comprehensive information including:
  * Market growth statistics
  * Implementation examples
  * Technical capabilities data
  * Healthcare impact metrics
- The information is sufficient for writing these opening sections
- No additional search sub-task needed

3. Writing Sub-task Needed?
- The task requires writing 800 words total:
  * Executive Summary (300 words)
  * Introduction (500 words)
- This is well below the 1000-word threshold for considering breakdown
- The sections are closely related and should be written together for consistency
- No need to break down into smaller writing tasks

Therefore, this appears to be an atomic writing task as:
- No additional analysis needed
- No additional search needed 
- Word count (800) is manageable as a single task

# Summary and Introduction
Today is 02.13.2025, You are the goal-updating and atomic writing task determination Agent in a recursive professional report-writing planning system:

1. **Goal Updating**: Based on the overall plan, the already-written report, existing search results and analysis conclusions, update or correct or revise the current writing task requirements as needed to make them more aligned with demands, and detailed. For example, provide more detailed requirements based on search results and design conclusions, or remove redundant content in the already-written report.

2. **Atomic Writing Task Determination**: Within the context of the overall plan and the already-written report, evaluate whether the given writing task is an atomic task, meaning it does not require further planning. According to research and analysis theories, a writing task can be further broken down into more granular writing sub-tasks, search sub-tasks and analysis sub-tasks. Writing tasks involve the actual creation of specific portions of text, while analysis sub-tasks can include tasks such as designing outlines, detailed outlines, data analysis, information organization, logic structure building, and key argument determination, e.t.c, to support actual writing; search sub-tasks are responsible for gathering necessary information and data from internet.

# Goal Updating Tips
- When the references in the task goal can be resolved using the results from the search or analysis tasks, update the task goal.
- When combining the results of search tasks or analysis tasks can make the task goal more specific, update the task goal.
- Carefully review the results of the dependent search or analysis tasks. If the current task goal is inappropriate or contains errors based on these results, update the task goal.
- Directly output the updated goal. If no updates are needed, output the original goal.

# Atomic Task Determination Rules
Independently determine, in order, whether the following three types of sub-tasks need to be broken down:

1. **analysis Sub-task**: If the writing requires certain design designs for support, and these design requirements are not provided by the **dependent design tasks** or the **already completed novel content**, then an design sub-task needs to be planned.

2. **search Sub-task**: If the writing requires external information (such as literature, academic results, industry data, policy documents, online resources, etc.), and these information is not provided by the **dependent tasks**  or the **already completed report content**, then an search sub-task needs to be planned.

3. **Writing Sub-task**: If and only if the requires a large amout of text output, at least > 1000 words, it my need to be broken down into multiple writing sub-tasks to reduce the burden of one-time creation. **When > 1500 words, it must be broken down.**

If either an analysis sub-task or a search sub-task or a writing sub-task needs to be created, the task is considered a complex task.

# Report Requirements (Achievable through Analysis Tasks and Search Tasks)  
- **Data Accuracy and Evidence Support**:  
	- **Detailed Data**: The report must rely on comprehensive and accurate data from authoritative sources.  
	- **Reliable Evidence**: Each argument must be supported by reliable data or literature.  
- **Systematic Argumentation**: Ensure the report contains systematic and thorough reasoning
	- Deep insights that go beyond surface-level observations
	- Critical evaluation of multiple perspectives
	- Well-supported conclusions backed by evidence
	- Original and thought-provoking interpretations
- **Information Integration and Multi-Angle Analysis**:  
	- **Comprehensive Integration**: Combine information and data from multiple angles and sources.  
	- **Thorough Validation**: Summarize, compare, and verify various arguments to ensure a comprehensive and in-depth analysis.   

# Output Format Requirement
1. First, think through the goal update in `<think></think>`. Then, based on the atomic task determination rules, evaluate in-depth and comprehensively whether analysis, search and writing sub-tasks need to be broken down. This determines whether the task is an atomic task or a complex task.

2. Then, output the results in `<result></result>`. In `<goal_updating></goal_updating>`, directly output the updated goal; if no updates are needed, output the original goal. In `<atomic_task_determination></atomic_task_determination>`, output whether the task is an atomic task or a complex task. 

The specific format is as follows:
<think>
Think about the goal update; then think in accordance with the atomic task determination rules.
</think>
<result>
<goal_updating>
[Updated goal]
</goal_updating>
<atomic_task_determination>
atomic/complex
</atomic_task_determination>
</result>

# Summary and Introduction
Today is 02.13.2025, You are the goal-updating and atomic writing task determination Agent in a recursive professional report-writing planning system:

1. **Goal Updating**: Based on the overall plan, the already-written report, existing search results and analysis conclusions, update or correct or revise the current writing task requirements as needed to make them more aligned with demands, and detailed. For example, provide more detailed requirements based on search results and design conclusions, or remove redundant content in the already-written report.

2. **Atomic Writing Task Determination**: Within the context of the overall plan and the already-written report, evaluate whether the given writing task is an atomic task, meaning it does not require further planning. According to research and analysis theories, a writing task can be further broken down into more granular writing sub-tasks, search sub-tasks and analysis sub-tasks. Writing tasks involve the actual creation of specific portions of text, while analysis sub-tasks can include tasks such as designing outlines, detailed outlines, data analysis, information organization, logic structure building, and key argument determination, e.t.c, to support actual writing; search sub-tasks are responsible for gathering necessary information and data from internet.

# Goal Updating Tips
- When the references in the task goal can be resolved using the results from the search or analysis tasks, update the task goal.
- When combining the results of search tasks or analysis tasks can make the task goal more specific, update the task goal.
- Carefully review the results of the dependent search or analysis tasks. If the current task goal is inappropriate or contains errors based on these results, update the task goal.
- Directly output the updated goal. If no updates are needed, output the original goal.

# Atomic Task Determination Rules
Independently determine, in order, whether the following three types of sub-tasks need to be broken down:

1. **analysis Sub-task**: If the writing requires certain design designs for support, and these design requirements are not provided by the **dependent design tasks** or the **already completed novel content**, then an design sub-task needs to be planned.

2. **search Sub-task**: If the writing requires external information (such as literature, academic results, industry data, policy documents, online resources, etc.), and these information is not provided by the **dependent tasks**  or the **already completed report content**, then an search sub-task needs to be planned.

3. **Writing Sub-task**: If and only if the requires a large amout of text output, at least > 1000 words, it my need to be broken down into multiple writing sub-tasks to reduce the burden of one-time creation. **When > 1500 words, it must be broken down.**

If either an analysis sub-task or a search sub-task or a writing sub-task needs to be created, the task is considered a complex task.

# Report Requirements (Achievable through Analysis Tasks and Search Tasks)  
- **Data Accuracy and Evidence Support**:  
	- **Detailed Data**: The report must rely on comprehensive and accurate data from authoritative sources.  
	- **Reliable Evidence**: Each argument must be supported by reliable data or literature.  
- **Systematic Argumentation**: Ensure the report contains systematic and thorough reasoning
	- Deep insights that go beyond surface-level observations
	- Critical evaluation of multiple perspectives
	- Well-supported conclusions backed by evidence
	- Original and thought-provoking interpretations
- **Information Integration and Multi-Angle Analysis**:  
	- **Comprehensive Integration**: Combine information and data from multiple angles and sources.  
	- **Thorough Validation**: Summarize, compare, and verify various arguments to ensure a comprehensive and in-depth analysis.   

# Output Format Requirement
1. First, think through the goal update in `<think></think>`. Then, based on the atomic task determination rules, evaluate in-depth and comprehensively whether analysis, search and writing sub-tasks need to be broken down. This determines whether the task is an atomic task or a complex task.

2. Then, output the results in `<result></result>`. In `<goal_updating></goal_updating>`, directly output the updated goal; if no updates are needed, output the original goal. In `<atomic_task_determination></atomic_task_determination>`, output whether the task is an atomic task or a complex task. 

The specific format is as follows:
<think>
Think about the goal update; then think in accordance with the atomic task determination rules.
</think>
<result>
<goal_updating>
[Updated goal]
</goal_updating>
<atomic_task_determination>

For example, provide more detailed requirements based on search results and design conclusions, or remove redundant content in the already-written report.\n\n2. **Atomic Writing Task Determination**: Within the context of the overall plan and the already-written report, evaluate whether the given writing task is an atomic task, meaning it does not require further planning. According to research and analysis theories, a writing task can be further broken down into more granular writing sub-tasks, search sub-tasks and analysis sub-tasks. Writing tasks involve the actual creation of specific portions of text, while analysis sub-tasks can include tasks such as designing outlines, detailed outlines, data analysis, information organization, logic structure building, and key argument determination, e.t.c, to support actual writing; search sub-tasks are responsible for gathering necessary information and data from internet.\n\n# Goal Updating Tips\n- When the references in the task goal can be resolved using the results from the search or analysis tasks, update the task goal.\n- When combining the results of search tasks or analysis tasks can make the task goal more specific, update the task goal.\n- Carefully review the results of the dependent search or analysis tasks. If the current task goal is inappropriate or contains errors based on these results, update the task goal.\n- Directly output the updated goal. If no updates are needed, output the original goal.\n\n# Atomic Task Determination Rules\nIndependently determine, in order, whether the following three types of sub-tasks need to be broken down:\n\n1. **analysis Sub-task**: If the writing requires certain design designs for support, and these design requirements are not provided by the **dependent design tasks** or the **already completed novel content**, then an design sub-task needs to be planned.\n\n2. **search Sub-task**: If the writing requires external information (such as literature, academic results, industry data, policy documents, online resources, etc.), and these information is not provided by the **dependent tasks**  or the **already completed report content**, then an search sub-task needs to be planned.\n\n3. **Writing Sub-task**: If and only if the requires a large amout of text output, at least > 1000 words, it my need to be broken down into multiple writing sub-tasks to reduce the burden of one-time creation. **When > 1500 words, it must be broken down.**\n\nIf either an analysis sub-task or a search sub-task or a writing sub-task needs to be created, the task is considered a complex task.\n\n# Report Requirements (Achievable through Analysis Tasks and Search Tasks)  \n- **Data Accuracy and Evidence Support**:  \n\t- **Detailed Data**: The report must rely on comprehensive and accurate data from authoritative sources.  \n\t- **Reliable Evidence**: Each argument must be supported by reliable data or literature.  \n- **Systematic Argumentation**: Ensure the report contains systematic and thorough reasoning\n\t- Deep insights that go beyond surface-level observations\n\t- Critical evaluation of multiple perspectives\n\t- Well-supported conclusions backed by evidence\n\t- Original and thought-provoking interpretations\n- **Information Integration and Multi-Angle Analysis**:  \n\t- **Comprehensive Integration**: Combine information and data from multiple angles and sources.  \n\t- **Thorough Validation**: Summarize, compare, and verify various arguments to ensure a comprehensive and in-depth analysis.   \n\n# Output Format Requirement\n1. First, think through the goal update in `<think></think>`. Then, based on the atomic task determination rules, evaluate in-depth and comprehensively whether analysis, search and writing sub-tasks need to be broken down. This determines whether the task is an atomic task or a complex task.\n\n2. Then, output the results in `<result></result>`. In `<goal_updating></goal_updating>`, directly output the updated goal; if no updates are needed, output the original goal. In `<atomic_task_determination></atomic_task_determination>`, output whether the task is an atomic task or a complex task. \n\nThe specific format is as follows:\n<think>\nThink about the goal update; then think in accordance with the atomic task determination rules.\n</think>\n<result>\n<goal_updating>\n[Updated goal]\n</goal_updating>\n<atomic_task_determination>\natomic/complex\n</atomic_task_determination>\n</result>\n\n===\nThe writing task you need to evaluate:\n```\n{\"id\": \"3.2\", \"dependency\": [\"3.1.3\", \"3.1\"], \"goal\": \"Write core section on AI in Medical Diagnosis\", \"task_type\": \"write\", \"length\": \"800 words\"}\n```\nComplete the goal-updating and atomic writing task determination job as requirements in # Summary and Introduction, # Goal Updating Tips, # Atomic Task Determination Rules and # Report Requirements.

2. **Atomic Writing Task Determination**: Within the context of the overall plan and the already-written report, evaluate whether the given writing task is an atomic task, meaning it does not require further planning. According to research and analysis theories, a writing task can be further broken down into more granular writing sub-tasks, search sub-tasks and analysis sub-tasks. Writing tasks involve the actual creation of specific portions of text, while analysis sub-tasks can include tasks such as designing outlines, detailed outlines, data analysis, information organization, logic structure building, and key argument determination, e.t.c, to support actual writing; search sub-tasks are responsible for gathering necessary information and data from internet.

# Goal Updating Tips
- When the references in the task goal can be resolved using the results from the search or analysis tasks, update the task goal.
- When combining the results of search tasks or analysis tasks can make the task goal more specific, update the task goal.
- Carefully review the results of the dependent search or analysis tasks. If the current task goal is inappropriate or contains errors based on these results, update the task goal.
- Directly output the updated goal. If no updates are needed, output the original goal.

# Atomic Task Determination Rules
Independently determine, in order, whether the following three types of sub-tasks need to be broken down:

1. **analysis Sub-task**: If the writing requires certain design designs for support, and these design requirements are not provided by the **dependent design tasks** or the **already completed novel content**, then an design sub-task needs to be planned.

2. **search Sub-task**: If the writing requires external information (such as literature, academic results, industry data, policy documents, online resources, etc.), and these information is not provided by the **dependent tasks**  or the **already completed report content**, then an search sub-task needs to be planned.

3. **Writing Sub-task**: If and only if the requires a large amout of text output, at least > 1000 words, it my need to be broken down into multiple writing sub-tasks to reduce the burden of one-time creation. **When > 1500 words, it must be broken down.**

If either an analysis sub-task or a search sub-task or a writing sub-task needs to be created, the task is considered a complex task.

# Report Requirements (Achievable through Analysis Tasks and Search Tasks)  
- **Data Accuracy and Evidence Support**:  
	- **Detailed Data**: The report must rely on comprehensive and accurate data from authoritative sources.  
	- **Reliable Evidence**: Each argument must be supported by reliable data or literature.  
- **Systematic Argumentation**: Ensure the report contains systematic and thorough reasoning
	- Deep insights that go beyond surface-level observations
	- Critical evaluation of multiple perspectives
	- Well-supported conclusions backed by evidence
	- Original and thought-provoking interpretations
- **Information Integration and Multi-Angle Analysis**:  
	- **Comprehensive Integration**: Combine information and data from multiple angles and sources.  
	- **Thorough Validation**: Summarize, compare, and verify various arguments to ensure a comprehensive and in-depth analysis.   

# Output Format Requirement
1. First, think through the goal update in `<think></think>`. Then, based on the atomic task determination rules, evaluate in-depth and comprehensively whether analysis, search and writing sub-tasks need to be broken down. This determines whether the task is an atomic task or a complex task.

2. Then, output the results in `<result></result>`. In `<goal_updating></goal_updating>`, directly output the updated goal; if no updates are needed, output the original goal. In `<atomic_task_determination></atomic_task_determination>`, output whether the task is an atomic task or a complex task. 

The specific format is as follows:
<think>
Think about the goal update; then think in accordance with the atomic task determination rules.
</think>
<result>
<goal_updating>
[Updated goal]
</goal_updating>
<atomic_task_determination>

# Summary and Introduction
Today is 02.13.2025, You are the goal-updating and atomic writing task determination Agent in a recursive professional report-writing planning system:

1. **Goal Updating**: Based on the overall plan, the already-written report, existing search results and analysis conclusions, update or correct or revise the current writing task requirements as needed to make them more aligned with demands, and detailed. For example, provide more detailed requirements based on search results and design conclusions, or remove redundant content in the already-written report.

2. **Atomic Writing Task Determination**: Within the context of the overall plan and the already-written report, evaluate whether the given writing task is an atomic task, meaning it does not require further planning. According to research and analysis theories, a writing task can be further broken down into more granular writing sub-tasks, search sub-tasks and analysis sub-tasks. Writing tasks involve the actual creation of specific portions of text, while analysis sub-tasks can include tasks such as designing outlines, detailed outlines, data analysis, information organization, logic structure building, and key argument determination, e.t.c, to support actual writing; search sub-tasks are responsible for gathering necessary information and data from internet.

# Goal Updating Tips
- When the references in the task goal can be resolved using the results from the search or analysis tasks, update the task goal.
- When combining the results of search tasks or analysis tasks can make the task goal more specific, update the task goal.
- Carefully review the results of the dependent search or analysis tasks. If the current task goal is inappropriate or contains errors based on these results, update the task goal.
- Directly output the updated goal. If no updates are needed, output the original goal.

# Atomic Task Determination Rules
Independently determine, in order, whether the following three types of sub-tasks need to be broken down:

1. **analysis Sub-task**: If the writing requires certain design designs for support, and these design requirements are not provided by the **dependent design tasks** or the **already completed novel content**, then an design sub-task needs to be planned.

2. **search Sub-task**: If the writing requires external information (such as literature, academic results, industry data, policy documents, online resources, etc.), and these information is not provided by the **dependent tasks**  or the **already completed report content**, then an search sub-task needs to be planned.

3. **Writing Sub-task**: If and only if the requires a large amout of text output, at least > 1000 words, it my need to be broken down into multiple writing sub-tasks to reduce the burden of one-time creation. **When > 1500 words, it must be broken down.**

If either an analysis sub-task or a search sub-task or a writing sub-task needs to be created, the task is considered a complex task.

# Report Requirements (Achievable through Analysis Tasks and Search Tasks)  
- **Data Accuracy and Evidence Support**:  
	- **Detailed Data**: The report must rely on comprehensive and accurate data from authoritative sources.  
	- **Reliable Evidence**: Each argument must be supported by reliable data or literature.  
- **Systematic Argumentation**: Ensure the report contains systematic and thorough reasoning
	- Deep insights that go beyond surface-level observations
	- Critical evaluation of multiple perspectives
	- Well-supported conclusions backed by evidence
	- Original and thought-provoking interpretations
- **Information Integration and Multi-Angle Analysis**:  
	- **Comprehensive Integration**: Combine information and data from multiple angles and sources.  
	- **Thorough Validation**: Summarize, compare, and verify various arguments to ensure a comprehensive and in-depth analysis.   

# Output Format Requirement
1. First, think through the goal update in `<think></think>`. Then, based on the atomic task determination rules, evaluate in-depth and comprehensively whether analysis, search and writing sub-tasks need to be broken down. This determines whether the task is an atomic task or a complex task.

2. Then, output the results in `<result></result>`. In `<goal_updating></goal_updating>`, directly output the updated goal; if no updates are needed, output the original goal. In `<atomic_task_determination></atomic_task_determination>`, output whether the task is an atomic task or a complex task. 

The specific format is as follows:
<think>
Think about the goal update; then think in accordance with the atomic task determination rules.
</think>
<result>
<goal_updating>
[Updated goal]
</goal_updating>
<atomic_task_determination>
atomic/complex
</atomic_task_determination>
</result>

The following sections detail specific applications, outcomes, and considerations for successful AI integration in healthcare settings.\n\n## AI in Medical Diagnosis\n\nThe application of artificial intelligence in medical diagnosis represents one of the most promising developments in modern healthcare. AI systems have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in detecting and diagnosing various medical conditions, often matching or exceeding human expert performance. This section examines both the technical capabilities of AI diagnostic systems and their practical implementation in clinical settings.\n\n### Technical Capabilities and Performance Metrics\n\nAI diagnostic systems have achieved unprecedented accuracy levels across a wide spectrum of medical conditions. In breast cancer detection, advanced artificial neural networks (ANN) and deep belief networks have demonstrated exceptional accuracy rates ranging from 98.57% to 99.68%, significantly enhancing early detection capabilities [reference:2]. Similarly, in COVID-19 diagnosis, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) analyzing chest X-rays and CT scans have achieved accuracy rates up to 99.68%, providing crucial support during the pandemic response [reference:3].\n\nThe scope of AI's diagnostic capabilities extends to various chronic conditions:\n- Diabetes prediction models show accuracy rates ranging from 75.7% to 99%\n- Kidney disease detection systems using Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and ANNs achieve over 97% accuracy\n- Heart disease diagnostic tools, particularly those utilizing ensemble learning approaches, demonstrate accuracy rates exceeding 97% [reference:2][reference:3]\n\nRecent developments in AI models have pushed the boundaries of diagnostic capabilities even further. Med-Gemini, a state-of-the-art AI system, has achieved a remarkable 91.1% accuracy on the MedQA benchmark, demonstrating expert-level performance on medical licensing examination questions [reference:9]. Additionally, AI systems have shown a 12% improvement in chest X-ray report generation accuracy, enhancing the speed and precision of radiological diagnostics [reference:11].\n\n### Implementation in Clinical Practice\n\nThe transition from theoretical capabilities to practical applications has been marked by successful implementations across various healthcare settings. In medical imaging analysis, AI systems are being deployed for:\n- Real-time interpretation of 3D medical scans\n- Enhanced genomic health outcome predictions\n- Automated preliminary screening of routine imaging studies [reference:13]\n\nThese implementations have demonstrated particular success in emergency medicine and routine screening scenarios. Healthcare institutions implementing AI-powered diagnostic tools report significant improvements in workflow efficiency, with diagnosis times reduced from hours to minutes in emergency cases [reference:4].

This section examines both the technical capabilities of AI diagnostic systems and their practical implementation in clinical settings.

### Technical Capabilities and Performance Metrics

AI diagnostic systems have achieved unprecedented accuracy levels across a wide spectrum of medical conditions. In breast cancer detection, advanced artificial neural networks (ANN) and deep belief networks have demonstrated exceptional accuracy rates ranging from 98.57% to 99.68%, significantly enhancing early detection capabilities [reference:2]. Similarly, in COVID-19 diagnosis, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) analyzing chest X-rays and CT scans have achieved accuracy rates up to 99.68%, providing crucial support during the pandemic response [reference:3].

The scope of AI's diagnostic capabilities extends to various chronic conditions:
- Diabetes prediction models show accuracy rates ranging from 75.7% to 99%
- Kidney disease detection systems using Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and ANNs achieve over 97% accuracy
- Heart disease diagnostic tools, particularly those utilizing ensemble learning approaches, demonstrate accuracy rates exceeding 97% [reference:2][reference:3]

Recent developments in AI models have pushed the boundaries of diagnostic capabilities even further. Med-Gemini, a state-of-the-art AI system, has achieved a remarkable 91.1% accuracy on the MedQA benchmark, demonstrating expert-level performance on medical licensing examination questions [reference:9]. Additionally, AI systems have shown a 12% improvement in chest X-ray report generation accuracy, enhancing the speed and precision of radiological diagnostics [reference:11].

### Implementation in Clinical Practice

The transition from theoretical capabilities to practical applications has been marked by successful implementations across various healthcare settings. In medical imaging analysis, AI systems are being deployed for:
- Real-time interpretation of 3D medical scans
- Enhanced genomic health outcome predictions
- Automated preliminary screening of routine imaging studies [reference:13]

These implementations have demonstrated particular success in emergency medicine and routine screening scenarios. Healthcare institutions implementing AI-powered diagnostic tools report significant improvements in workflow efficiency, with diagnosis times reduced from hours to minutes in emergency cases [reference:4]. This acceleration in diagnostic processes has proven especially valuable in time-critical situations where rapid decision-making is essential.

The integration of AI diagnostic systems with existing healthcare infrastructure has yielded impressive results in clinical settings. Major healthcare institutions have reported:
- Improved early-stage disease detection, particularly in oncology, with breast cancer patients showing greater than 90% five-year survival rates when AI-assisted early diagnosis is employed [reference:2]
- Enhanced accuracy in routine screening procedures
- Reduced diagnostic errors through AI-powered second opinions
- More efficient allocation of clinical resources [reference:7]

### Comparative Performance with Human Expertise

When comparing AI performance with human expertise, studies have shown that AI systems can match or exceed human diagnostic accuracy in specific domains. This is particularly evident in:
- Radiological analysis, where AI systems have demonstrated expert-level performance in identifying subtle abnormalities
- Pathology screening, where AI assists in reducing false positives and negatives
- Complex pattern recognition in medical imaging [reference:11][reference:13]

However, it's important to note that AI's role is primarily complementary to human expertise rather than replacive. The most effective implementations combine AI's processing capabilities with clinician oversight, creating a synergistic approach that enhances diagnostic accuracy while maintaining the critical role of human judgment in medical decision-making.

The integration of AI in medical diagnosis continues to evolve, with ongoing research and development focusing on expanding capabilities and improving accuracy across an ever-wider range of medical conditions. As these systems become more sophisticated and widely implemented, they promise to further enhance the speed, accuracy, and accessibility of medical diagnostics, ultimately contributing to improved patient outcomes.

# Summary and Introduction
Today is 02.13.2025, You are the goal-updating and atomic writing task determination Agent in a recursive professional report-writing planning system:

1. **Goal Updating**: Based on the overall plan, the already-written report, existing search results and analysis conclusions, update or correct or revise the current writing task requirements as needed to make them more aligned with demands, and detailed. For example, provide more detailed requirements based on search results and design conclusions, or remove redundant content in the already-written report.

2. **Atomic Writing Task Determination**: Within the context of the overall plan and the already-written report, evaluate whether the given writing task is an atomic task, meaning it does not require further planning. According to research and analysis theories, a writing task can be further broken down into more granular writing sub-tasks, search sub-tasks and analysis sub-tasks. Writing tasks involve the actual creation of specific portions of text, while analysis sub-tasks can include tasks such as designing outlines, detailed outlines, data analysis, information organization, logic structure building, and key argument determination, e.t.c, to support actual writing; search sub-tasks are responsible for gathering necessary information and data from internet.

# Goal Updating Tips
- When the references in the task goal can be resolved using the results from the search or analysis tasks, update the task goal.
- When combining the results of search tasks or analysis tasks can make the task goal more specific, update the task goal.
- Carefully review the results of the dependent search or analysis tasks. If the current task goal is inappropriate or contains errors based on these results, update the task goal.
- Directly output the updated goal. If no updates are needed, output the original goal.

# Atomic Task Determination Rules
Independently determine, in order, whether the following three types of sub-tasks need to be broken down:

1. **analysis Sub-task**: If the writing requires certain design designs for support, and these design requirements are not provided by the **dependent design tasks** or the **already completed novel content**, then an design sub-task needs to be planned.

2. **search Sub-task**: If the writing requires external information (such as literature, academic results, industry data, policy documents, online resources, etc.), and these information is not provided by the **dependent tasks**  or the **already completed report content**, then an search sub-task needs to be planned.

3. **Writing Sub-task**: If and only if the requires a large amout of text output, at least > 1000 words, it my need to be broken down into multiple writing sub-tasks to reduce the burden of one-time creation. **When > 1500 words, it must be broken down.**

If either an analysis sub-task or a search sub-task or a writing sub-task needs to be created, the task is considered a complex task.

# Report Requirements (Achievable through Analysis Tasks and Search Tasks)  
- **Data Accuracy and Evidence Support**:  
	- **Detailed Data**: The report must rely on comprehensive and accurate data from authoritative sources.  
	- **Reliable Evidence**: Each argument must be supported by reliable data or literature.  
- **Systematic Argumentation**: Ensure the report contains systematic and thorough reasoning
	- Deep insights that go beyond surface-level observations
	- Critical evaluation of multiple perspectives
	- Well-supported conclusions backed by evidence
	- Original and thought-provoking interpretations
- **Information Integration and Multi-Angle Analysis**:  
	- **Comprehensive Integration**: Combine information and data from multiple angles and sources.  
	- **Thorough Validation**: Summarize, compare, and verify various arguments to ensure a comprehensive and in-depth analysis.   

# Output Format Requirement
1. First, think through the goal update in `<think></think>`. Then, based on the atomic task determination rules, evaluate in-depth and comprehensively whether analysis, search and writing sub-tasks need to be broken down. This determines whether the task is an atomic task or a complex task.

2. Then, output the results in `<result></result>`. In `<goal_updating></goal_updating>`, directly output the updated goal; if no updates are needed, output the original goal. In `<atomic_task_determination></atomic_task_determination>`, output whether the task is an atomic task or a complex task. 

The specific format is as follows:
<think>
Think about the goal update; then think in accordance with the atomic task determination rules.
</think>
<result>
<goal_updating>
[Updated goal]
</goal_updating>
<atomic_task_determination>
atomic/complex
</atomic_task_determination>
</result>

For example, provide more detailed requirements based on search results and design conclusions, or remove redundant content in the already-written report.\n\n2. **Atomic Writing Task Determination**: Within the context of the overall plan and the already-written report, evaluate whether the given writing task is an atomic task, meaning it does not require further planning. According to research and analysis theories, a writing task can be further broken down into more granular writing sub-tasks, search sub-tasks and analysis sub-tasks. Writing tasks involve the actual creation of specific portions of text, while analysis sub-tasks can include tasks such as designing outlines, detailed outlines, data analysis, information organization, logic structure building, and key argument determination, e.t.c, to support actual writing; search sub-tasks are responsible for gathering necessary information and data from internet.\n\n# Goal Updating Tips\n- When the references in the task goal can be resolved using the results from the search or analysis tasks, update the task goal.\n- When combining the results of search tasks or analysis tasks can make the task goal more specific, update the task goal.\n- Carefully review the results of the dependent search or analysis tasks. If the current task goal is inappropriate or contains errors based on these results, update the task goal.\n- Directly output the updated goal. If no updates are needed, output the original goal.\n\n# Atomic Task Determination Rules\nIndependently determine, in order, whether the following three types of sub-tasks need to be broken down:\n\n1. **analysis Sub-task**: If the writing requires certain design designs for support, and these design requirements are not provided by the **dependent design tasks** or the **already completed novel content**, then an design sub-task needs to be planned.\n\n2. **search Sub-task**: If the writing requires external information (such as literature, academic results, industry data, policy documents, online resources, etc.), and these information is not provided by the **dependent tasks**  or the **already completed report content**, then an search sub-task needs to be planned.\n\n3. **Writing Sub-task**: If and only if the requires a large amout of text output, at least > 1000 words, it my need to be broken down into multiple writing sub-tasks to reduce the burden of one-time creation. **When > 1500 words, it must be broken down.**\n\nIf either an analysis sub-task or a search sub-task or a writing sub-task needs to be created, the task is considered a complex task.\n\n# Report Requirements (Achievable through Analysis Tasks and Search Tasks)  \n- **Data Accuracy and Evidence Support**:  \n\t- **Detailed Data**: The report must rely on comprehensive and accurate data from authoritative sources.  \n\t- **Reliable Evidence**: Each argument must be supported by reliable data or literature.  \n- **Systematic Argumentation**: Ensure the report contains systematic and thorough reasoning\n\t- Deep insights that go beyond surface-level observations\n\t- Critical evaluation of multiple perspectives\n\t- Well-supported conclusions backed by evidence\n\t- Original and thought-provoking interpretations\n- **Information Integration and Multi-Angle Analysis**:  \n\t- **Comprehensive Integration**: Combine information and data from multiple angles and sources.  \n\t- **Thorough Validation**: Summarize, compare, and verify various arguments to ensure a comprehensive and in-depth analysis.   \n\n# Output Format Requirement\n1.

# Summary and Introduction
Today is 02.13.2025, You are the goal-updating and atomic writing task determination Agent in a recursive professional report-writing planning system:

1. **Goal Updating**: Based on the overall plan, the already-written report, existing search results and analysis conclusions, update or correct or revise the current writing task requirements as needed to make them more aligned with demands, and detailed. For example, provide more detailed requirements based on search results and design conclusions, or remove redundant content in the already-written report.

2. **Atomic Writing Task Determination**: Within the context of the overall plan and the already-written report, evaluate whether the given writing task is an atomic task, meaning it does not require further planning. According to research and analysis theories, a writing task can be further broken down into more granular writing sub-tasks, search sub-tasks and analysis sub-tasks. Writing tasks involve the actual creation of specific portions of text, while analysis sub-tasks can include tasks such as designing outlines, detailed outlines, data analysis, information organization, logic structure building, and key argument determination, e.t.c, to support actual writing; search sub-tasks are responsible for gathering necessary information and data from internet.

# Goal Updating Tips
- When the references in the task goal can be resolved using the results from the search or analysis tasks, update the task goal.
- When combining the results of search tasks or analysis tasks can make the task goal more specific, update the task goal.
- Carefully review the results of the dependent search or analysis tasks. If the current task goal is inappropriate or contains errors based on these results, update the task goal.
- Directly output the updated goal. If no updates are needed, output the original goal.

# Atomic Task Determination Rules
Independently determine, in order, whether the following three types of sub-tasks need to be broken down:

1. **analysis Sub-task**: If the writing requires certain design designs for support, and these design requirements are not provided by the **dependent design tasks** or the **already completed novel content**, then an design sub-task needs to be planned.

2. **search Sub-task**: If the writing requires external information (such as literature, academic results, industry data, policy documents, online resources, etc.), and these information is not provided by the **dependent tasks**  or the **already completed report content**, then an search sub-task needs to be planned.

3. **Writing Sub-task**: If and only if the requires a large amout of text output, at least > 1000 words, it my need to be broken down into multiple writing sub-tasks to reduce the burden of one-time creation. **When > 1500 words, it must be broken down.**

If either an analysis sub-task or a search sub-task or a writing sub-task needs to be created, the task is considered a complex task.

# Report Requirements (Achievable through Analysis Tasks and Search Tasks)  
- **Data Accuracy and Evidence Support**:  
	- **Detailed Data**: The report must rely on comprehensive and accurate data from authoritative sources.  
	- **Reliable Evidence**: Each argument must be supported by reliable data or literature.  
- **Systematic Argumentation**: Ensure the report contains systematic and thorough reasoning
	- Deep insights that go beyond surface-level observations
	- Critical evaluation of multiple perspectives
	- Well-supported conclusions backed by evidence
	- Original and thought-provoking interpretations
- **Information Integration and Multi-Angle Analysis**:  
	- **Comprehensive Integration**: Combine information and data from multiple angles and sources.  
	- **Thorough Validation**: Summarize, compare, and verify various arguments to ensure a comprehensive and in-depth analysis.   

# Output Format Requirement
1. First, think through the goal update in `<think></think>`. Then, based on the atomic task determination rules, evaluate in-depth and comprehensively whether analysis, search and writing sub-tasks need to be broken down. This determines whether the task is an atomic task or a complex task.

2. Then, output the results in `<result></result>`. In `<goal_updating></goal_updating>`, directly output the updated goal; if no updates are needed, output the original goal. In `<atomic_task_determination></atomic_task_determination>`, output whether the task is an atomic task or a complex task. 

The specific format is as follows:
<think>
Think about the goal update; then think in accordance with the atomic task determination rules.
</think>
<result>
<goal_updating>
[Updated goal]
</goal_updating>
<atomic_task_determination>

For example, provide more detailed requirements based on search results and design conclusions, or remove redundant content in the already-written report.\n\n2. **Atomic Writing Task Determination**: Within the context of the overall plan and the already-written report, evaluate whether the given writing task is an atomic task, meaning it does not require further planning. According to research and analysis theories, a writing task can be further broken down into more granular writing sub-tasks, search sub-tasks and analysis sub-tasks. Writing tasks involve the actual creation of specific portions of text, while analysis sub-tasks can include tasks such as designing outlines, detailed outlines, data analysis, information organization, logic structure building, and key argument determination, e.t.c, to support actual writing; search sub-tasks are responsible for gathering necessary information and data from internet.\n\n# Goal Updating Tips\n- When the references in the task goal can be resolved using the results from the search or analysis tasks, update the task goal.\n- When combining the results of search tasks or analysis tasks can make the task goal more specific, update the task goal.\n- Carefully review the results of the dependent search or analysis tasks. If the current task goal is inappropriate or contains errors based on these results, update the task goal.\n- Directly output the updated goal. If no updates are needed, output the original goal.\n\n# Atomic Task Determination Rules\nIndependently determine, in order, whether the following three types of sub-tasks need to be broken down:\n\n1. **analysis Sub-task**: If the writing requires certain design designs for support, and these design requirements are not provided by the **dependent design tasks** or the **already completed novel content**, then an design sub-task needs to be planned.\n\n2. **search Sub-task**: If the writing requires external information (such as literature, academic results, industry data, policy documents, online resources, etc.), and these information is not provided by the **dependent tasks**  or the **already completed report content**, then an search sub-task needs to be planned.\n\n3. **Writing Sub-task**: If and only if the requires a large amout of text output, at least > 1000 words, it my need to be broken down into multiple writing sub-tasks to reduce the burden of one-time creation. **When > 1500 words, it must be broken down.**\n\nIf either an analysis sub-task or a search sub-task or a writing sub-task needs to be created, the task is considered a complex task.\n\n# Report Requirements (Achievable through Analysis Tasks and Search Tasks)  \n- **Data Accuracy and Evidence Support**:  \n\t- **Detailed Data**: The report must rely on comprehensive and accurate data from authoritative sources.  \n\t- **Reliable Evidence**: Each argument must be supported by reliable data or literature.  \n- **Systematic Argumentation**: Ensure the report contains systematic and thorough reasoning\n\t- Deep insights that go beyond surface-level observations\n\t- Critical evaluation of multiple perspectives\n\t- Well-supported conclusions backed by evidence\n\t- Original and thought-provoking interpretations\n- **Information Integration and Multi-Angle Analysis**:  \n\t- **Comprehensive Integration**: Combine information and data from multiple angles and sources.  \n\t- **Thorough Validation**: Summarize, compare, and verify various arguments to ensure a comprehensive and in-depth analysis.   \n\n# Output Format Requirement\n1. First, think through the goal update in `<think></think>`. Then, based on the atomic task determination rules, evaluate in-depth and comprehensively whether analysis, search and writing sub-tasks need to be broken down. This determines whether the task is an atomic task or a complex task.\n\n2. Then, output the results in `<result></result>`. In `<goal_updating></goal_updating>`, directly output the updated goal; if no updates are needed, output the original goal. In `<atomic_task_determination></atomic_task_determination>`, output whether the task is an atomic task or a complex task. \n\nThe specific format is as follows:\n<think>\nThink about the goal update; then think in accordance with the atomic task determination rules.\n</think>\n<result>\n<goal_updating>\n[Updated goal]\n</goal_updating>\n<atomic_task_determination>\natomic/complex\n</atomic_task_determination>\n</result>\n\n===\nThe writing task you need to evaluate:\n```\n{\"id\": \"3.5\", \"dependency\": [\"3.4.3\", \"3.1\", \"3.2\", \"3.3\", \"3.4\"], \"goal\": \"Write closing sections including Challenges, Future Directions, and Conclusions\", \"task_type\": \"write\", \"length\": \"800 words\"}\n```\nComplete the goal-updating and atomic writing task determination job as requirements in # Summary and Introduction, # Goal Updating Tips, # Atomic Task Determination Rules and # Report Requirements.

# Overall Introduction
You are a recursive professional report-writing and information seeking planning expert, specializing in planning professional report writing based on in-depth research、search and analysis. A high-level plan tailored to the user's knowledge problem-solving needs is already in place, and your task is to further recursively plan the specified writing sub-tasks within this framework. Through your planning, the resulting report will strictly adhere to user requirements and achieve perfection in terms of analysis, logic, and content depth.

1. Continue the recursive planning for the specified professional report-writing sub-tasks. According to research and analysis theories, break down the organization of report writing and the results of analysis tasks into more granular writing sub-tasks, specifying their scope and specific writing content.
2. Plan analysis sub-tasks and search sub-tasks as needed to assist and support specific writing. Analysis sub-tasks can include tasks such as designing outlines, detailed outlines, data analysis, information organization, logic structure building, and key argument determination to support actual writing. Search sub-tasks are responsible for gathering necessary information and data from internet.
3. For each task, plan a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of sub-tasks, where the edges represent dependency relationships between search and analysis tasks within the same layer of the DAG. Recursively plan each sub-task until all sub-tasks become atomic tasks.

# Task Types
## Writing (Core, Actual Writing)
- **Function**: Perform actual report-writing tasks in sequence according to the plan. Based on specific writing requirements and already written content, continue writing in conjunction with the conclusions of analysis tasks and search tasks.
- **All writing tasks are continuation tasks**: Ensure continuity and logical consistency with the preceding content during planning. Writing tasks should flow smoothly and seamlessly with one another, maintaining the overall coherence and unity of the report.
- **Breakable tasks**: Writing, Analysis, Search
- Unless necessary, each writing sub-task should be > 500 words.

## Analysis  
- **Function**: Analyze and design any requirements outside of actual report writing. This includes but is not limited to research plan design, designing outlines, detailed outlines, data analysis, information organization, logic structure building, key argument determination, etc., to support actual writing.
- **Breakable tasks**: Analysis, Search

## Search  
- **Function**: Perform information-gathering tasks, including collecting necessary data, materials, and information from internet to support analysis and writing tasks.
- **Breakable tasks**: Search

# Planning Tips  
1. The last sub-task derived from a writing task must always be a writing task.  
2. Reasonably control the number of sub-tasks in each layer of the DAG, **generally 3–5 sub-tasks**. If the number of tasks exceeds this range, aim to plan recursively. **Do not planning over 8 sub-tasks in one layer.**
3. **Analysis tasks** and **search tasks** can serve as **sub-tasks of writing tasks**, more analysis sub-tasks and search sub-tasks should be generated to enhance the quality of writing.  
4. Use `dependency` to list the IDs of analysis tasks and search tasks within the same-layer DAG. List all potential dependencies as comprehensively as possible.
5. **When an analysis sub-task involves designing specific writing structures, subsequent dependent writing tasks should not be flatten, it should be recursived. e.g., write xxx acorrding to the structure.**. Never forget it.
6. **Do not redundantly plan tasks already covered in the `overall plan` or duplicate content already present in the `already written report content`, and previous analysis tasks.**  
7. Follow the results of analysis tasks and search tasks.
8. search tasks goal only specify the information requirements, do not specify the source or specify how to search.
**9**. Unless specified by user, the length of each writing task should be > 500 words.

# Task Attributes (Required)  
1. **id**: The unique identifier for the sub-task, indicating its level and task number.  
2. **goal**: A precise and complete description of the sub-task goal in string format.  
3. **dependency**: A list of IDs of search and analysis tasks tasks within the same-layer DAG that this task depends on. List all potential dependencies as comprehensively as possible. If there are no dependent sub-tasks, this should be empty.  
4. **task_type**: A string indicating the type of task. Writing tasks are labeled as `write`, analysis tasks are labeled as `think`, and search tasks are labeled as `search`.  
5. **length**: For writing tasks, this attribute specifies the scope. It is required for writing tasks. Analysis tasks and search tasks do not require this attribute.  
6. **sub_tasks**: A JSON list representing the sub-task DAG. Each element in the list is a JSON object representing a task.

# Example
<example index=1>
User-given writing task:
{
    "id": "",
    "task_type": "write",
    "goal": "Generate a detailed business biography to document DeepSeek's rise",
    "length": "8600 words"
}

A partially complete recursive global plan is provided as a reference, represented in a recursively nested JSON structure. The `sub_tasks` field represents the DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) of the task planning. If `sub_tasks` is empty, it indicates an atomic task or one that has not yet been further planned:

A high-level plan tailored to the user's knowledge problem-solving needs is already in place, and your task is to further recursively plan the specified writing sub-tasks within this framework. Through your planning, the resulting report will strictly adhere to user requirements and achieve perfection in terms of analysis, logic, and content depth.\n\n1. Continue the recursive planning for the specified professional report-writing sub-tasks. According to research and analysis theories, break down the organization of report writing and the results of analysis tasks into more granular writing sub-tasks, specifying their scope and specific writing content.\n2. Plan analysis sub-tasks and search sub-tasks as needed to assist and support specific writing. Analysis sub-tasks can include tasks such as designing outlines, detailed outlines, data analysis, information organization, logic structure building, and key argument determination to support actual writing. Search sub-tasks are responsible for gathering necessary information and data from internet.\n3. For each task, plan a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of sub-tasks, where the edges represent dependency relationships between search and analysis tasks within the same layer of the DAG. Recursively plan each sub-task until all sub-tasks become atomic tasks.\n\n# Task Types\n## Writing (Core, Actual Writing)\n- **Function**: Perform actual report-writing tasks in sequence according to the plan. Based on specific writing requirements and already written content, continue writing in conjunction with the conclusions of analysis tasks and search tasks.\n- **All writing tasks are continuation tasks**: Ensure continuity and logical consistency with the preceding content during planning. Writing tasks should flow smoothly and seamlessly with one another, maintaining the overall coherence and unity of the report.\n- **Breakable tasks**: Writing, Analysis, Search\n- Unless necessary, each writing sub-task should be > 500 words.\n\n## Analysis  \n- **Function**: Analyze and design any requirements outside of actual report writing. This includes but is not limited to research plan design, designing outlines, detailed outlines, data analysis, information organization, logic structure building, key argument determination, etc., to support actual writing.\n- **Breakable tasks**: Analysis, Search\n\n## Search  \n- **Function**: Perform information-gathering tasks, including collecting necessary data, materials, and information from internet to support analysis and writing tasks.\n- **Breakable tasks**: Search\n\n# Planning Tips  \n1. The last sub-task derived from a writing task must always be a writing task.  \n2. Reasonably control the number of sub-tasks in each layer of the DAG, **generally 3–5 sub-tasks**. If the number of tasks exceeds this range, aim to plan recursively. **Do not planning over 8 sub-tasks in one layer.**\n3. **Analysis tasks** and **search tasks** can serve as **sub-tasks of writing tasks**, more analysis sub-tasks and search sub-tasks should be generated to enhance the quality of writing.  \n4. Use `dependency` to list the IDs of analysis tasks and search tasks within the same-layer DAG. List all potential dependencies as comprehensively as possible.\n5. **When an analysis sub-task involves designing specific writing structures, subsequent dependent writing tasks should not be flatten, it should be recursived. e.g., write xxx acorrding to the structure.**. Never forget it.\n6. **Do not redundantly plan tasks already covered in the `overall plan` or duplicate content already present in the `already written report content`, and previous analysis tasks.**  \n7. Follow the results of analysis tasks and search tasks.\n8. search tasks goal only specify the information requirements, do not specify the source or specify how to search.\n**9**. Unless specified by user, the length of each writing task should be > 500 words.\n\n# Task Attributes (Required)  \n1. **id**: The unique identifier for the sub-task, indicating its level and task number.  \n2. **goal**: A precise and complete description of the sub-task goal in string format.  \n3. **dependency**: A list of IDs of search and analysis tasks tasks within the same-layer DAG that this task depends on. List all potential dependencies as comprehensively as possible. If there are no dependent sub-tasks, this should be empty.  \n4. **task_type**: A string indicating the type of task. Writing tasks are labeled as `write`, analysis tasks are labeled as `think`, and search tasks are labeled as `search`.  \n5. **length**: For writing tasks, this attribute specifies the scope. It is required for writing tasks. Analysis tasks and search tasks do not require this attribute.  \n6. **sub_tasks**: A JSON list representing the sub-task DAG. Each element in the list is a JSON object representing a task.\n\n# Example\n<example index=1>\nUser-given writing task:\n{\n    \"id\": \"\",\n    \"task_type\": \"write\",\n    \"goal\": \"Generate a detailed business biography to document DeepSeek's rise\",\n    \"length\": \"8600 words\"\n}\n\nA partially complete recursive global plan is provided as a reference, represented in a recursively nested JSON structure.

Result: <think>
Let me analyze this writing task for the closing sections:

1. Task Analysis:
- Need to write 3 distinct sections with specific word counts and focus areas
- Must connect to previous content while providing forward-looking insights
- Requires synthesis of earlier sections and new specific examples
- Needs both analytical depth and actionable recommendations

2. Planning Considerations:
- Should break down into separate writing tasks for each section
- Need additional analysis tasks to:
  * Synthesize key challenges and limitations
  * Identify emerging trends and future directions
  * Formulate strategic recommendations
- Should maintain logical flow between sections
- Need to ensure proper integration of statistics and examples

3. Dependencies:
- Requires synthesis of all previous sections (3.1-3.4)
- Needs additional analysis for recommendations
- May need supplementary search for latest developments

4. Structure Requirements:
- Each section needs specific examples and evidence
- Must maintain systematic argumentation
- Should provide actionable insights
- Must connect to previous content

Based on this analysis, I'll plan a recursive structure with analysis tasks to support each major section, followed by coordinated writing tasks.

The exponential growth of healthcare data presents one of the most pressing challenges, with the sector generating approximately 30% of global data volume and experiencing an annual growth rate of 36% [reference:6]. This massive data volume creates substantial management challenges in terms of storage, processing, and meaningful analysis.\n\nImplementation barriers present another significant hurdle for healthcare organizations. The integration of AI systems with existing Electronic Health Record (EHR) infrastructure requires careful planning and substantial resources, as evidenced by Mayo Clinic's experience in managing over 250 AI research projects simultaneously [reference:12]. Healthcare institutions must also contend with the need for continuous monitoring and validation of AI outputs to prevent potential errors in clinical documentation and decision-making.\n\nWorkforce considerations represent a critical challenge in AI implementation. The current healthcare workforce shortage impacts organizations' capacity to effectively implement and manage AI systems [reference:15]. Healthcare professionals require extensive training to utilize AI tools effectively, while new roles and expertise are needed for system management and oversight. This creates a dual challenge of upskilling existing staff while recruiting specialists with AI-specific expertise.\n\nTechnical limitations also pose significant challenges. Current AI systems sometimes struggle with accurately understanding user intent and context in clinical settings [reference:6]. The complexity of medical decision-making often requires nuanced judgment that AI systems may not fully replicate. Additionally, ensuring system reliability and managing downtime risks remains crucial, particularly in critical care settings where continuous operation is essential.\n\nThese challenges are interconnected and require comprehensive solutions that address technical, organizational, and human factors simultaneously. Healthcare institutions must develop robust implementation frameworks, comprehensive training programs, and clear risk management strategies while maintaining their primary focus on patient care quality and safety.\n\n</article>",
