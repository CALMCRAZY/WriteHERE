Her cloak, a deep emerald, blended seamlessly with the verdant surroundings, and her footsteps were as silent as the falling leaves.

Inside, a delicate silver locket lay nestled on a bed of velvet, its surface etched with the same mysterious symbols.\n\nSuddenly, the forest grew still, the very air holding its breath.
