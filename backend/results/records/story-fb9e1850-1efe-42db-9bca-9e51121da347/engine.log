        "content": "# Overall Introduction\nYou are a recursive professional novel-writing planning expert adept at planning professional novel writing based on narrative theory. A high-level plan tailored to the user's novel-writing needs is already in place, and your task is to further recursively plan the specified writing sub-tasks within this framework. Through your planning, the resulting novel will strictly adhere to user requirements and achieve perfection in terms of plot, creativity (ideas, themes, and topics), and development.\n\n1. Continue the recursive planning for the specified professional novel-writing sub-tasks. According to narrative theory, the organization of story writing and the result of the design tasks, break the tasks down into more granular writing sub-tasks, specifying their scope and specific writing content.  \n2. Plan design sub-tasks as needed to assist and support specific writing. Design sub-tasks can include designing core conflicts, character settings, outlines and detailed outlines, key story beats, story backgrounds, plot elements, etc., to support the actual writing.  \n3. For each task, plan a sub-task DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), where the edges represent dependency relationships between design tasks within the same layer of the DAG. Recursively plan each sub-task until all sub-tasks are atomic tasks.\n\n# Task Types\n## Writing (Core, actual writing)\n- **Function**: Perform actual novel-writing tasks in sequence according to the plan. Based on specific writing requirements and already-written content, continue writing in conjunction with the conclusions of design tasks.  \n- **All writing tasks are continuation tasks**: Ensure continuity with the preceding content during planning. Writing tasks should flow smoothly and seamlessly with one another.  \n- **Breakable tasks**: Writing, Design  \n- Unless necessary, each writing sub-task should be > 500 words.\n\n## Design\n- **Function**: Analyze and design any novel-writing needs other than actual writing. This includes but is not limited to designing core conflicts, character settings, outlines and detailed outlines, key story beats, story backgrounds, plot elements, etc., to support the actual writing.  \n- **Breakable tasks**: Design  \n\n# Information Provided to You\n- **`Already-written novel content`**: Content from previous writing tasks that has already been written.  \n- **`Overall plan`**: The overall writing plan, which specifies the task you need to plan through the `is_current_to_plan_task` key.  \n- **`Results of design tasks completed in higher-level tasks`**  \n- **`Results of design tasks dependent on the same-layer DAG tasks`**  \n- **`Writing tasks that require further planning`**  \n- **`Reference planning`**: A planning sample is provided, which you may cautiously reference.  \n\n# Planning Tips\n1. The last sub-task derived from a writing task must always be a writing task.  \n2. Reasonably control the number of sub-tasks in each layer of the DAG, generally 3–5 sub-tasks. If the number of tasks exceeds this, aim to plan recursively.  \n3. **Design tasks** can serve as **sub-tasks of writing tasks**, and as many design sub-tasks as possible should be generated to enhance the quality of writing.  \n4. Use `dependency` to list the IDs of design tasks within the same-layer DAG. List all potential dependencies as comprehensively as possible.  \n5. When a design sub-task involves designing specific writing structures (e.g., plot design), subsequent dependent writing tasks should not be laid out flat but should await recursive planning in subsequent rounds.  \n6. **Do not redundantly plan tasks already covered in the `overall plan` or duplicate content already present in the `already-written novel content`, and previous design tasks. ** \n7. Writing tasks should flow smoothly and seamlessly, ensuring continuity in the narrative.\n8. Following the Results of design tasks\n\n# Task Attributes\n1. **id**: The unique identifier for the sub-task, indicating its level and task number.  \n2. **goal**: A precise and complete description of the sub-task goal in string format.  \n3. **dependency**: A list of design task IDs from the same-layer DAG that this task depends on. List all potential dependencies as comprehensively as possible. If there are no dependent sub-tasks, this should be empty.  \n4. **task_type**: A string indicating the type of task. Writing tasks are labeled as `write`, and design tasks are labeled as `think`.  \n5. **length**: For writing tasks, this attribute specifies the scope, it is required for writing task. Design tasks do not require this attribute.  \n6. **sub_tasks**: A JSON list representing the sub-task DAG. Each element in the list is a JSON object representing a task.\n\n\n# Example\n\n<example index=1>\nUser-given writing task:\n{\n    \"id\": \"\",\n    \"task_type\": \"write\",\n    \"goal\": \"Create an excellent suspense story set in the colony on Europa (Jupiter’s moon), incorporating the real environmental characteristics of Europa.

To effectively plan the writing task of creating a 1000-word story for a child who dreams of becoming a pilot, we need to consider several key elements. The story should be engaging, imaginative, and inspiring, capturing the child's interest and encouraging their aspirations. Given the absence of any pre-existing design tasks or content, we must start from scratch, focusing on both design and writing sub-tasks.

1. **Design Sub-tasks**:
   - **Character Design**: Create a relatable and inspiring main character who dreams of becoming a pilot. This character should have traits that resonate with children, such as curiosity, bravery, and determination.
   - **Plot Design**: Outline a simple yet engaging plot that includes the main character's journey towards becoming a pilot. This should include challenges, learning experiences, and a satisfying resolution.
   - **Setting Design**: Develop a vibrant and imaginative setting that will captivate a child's imagination. This could include fantastical elements or realistic settings that highlight the world of aviation.
   - **Theme and Message**: Determine the core message of the story, such as the importance of perseverance, following one's dreams, or the excitement of exploration.

2. **Writing Sub-tasks**:
   - **Introduction**: Introduce the main character and their dream of becoming a pilot. Set the stage for the adventure.
   - **Adventure and Challenges**: Describe the main character's journey, including the challenges they face and the lessons they learn.
   - **Climax and Resolution**: Conclude the story with a climax that showcases the character's growth and the realization of their dream.
   - **Conclusion**: Wrap up the story with a positive message that reinforces the theme.

By breaking down the task into these design and writing sub-tasks, we can ensure a coherent and engaging story that aligns with the goal of inspiring a child who dreams of becoming a pilot.

This should include challenges, learning experiences, and a satisfying resolution.\n   - **Setting Design**: Develop a vibrant and imaginative setting that will captivate a child's imagination. This could include fantastical elements or realistic settings that highlight the world of aviation.\n   - **Theme and Message**: Determine the core message of the story, such as the importance of perseverance, following one's dreams, or the excitement of exploration.\n\n2. **Writing Sub-tasks**:\n   - **Introduction**: Introduce the main character and their dream of becoming a pilot. Set the stage for the adventure.\n   - **Adventure and Challenges**: Describe the main character's journey, including the challenges they face and the lessons they learn.\n   - **Climax and Resolution**: Conclude the story with a climax that showcases the character's growth and the realization of their dream.\n   - **Conclusion**: Wrap up the story with a positive message that reinforces the theme.\n\nBy breaking down the task into these design and writing sub-tasks, we can ensure a coherent and engaging story that aligns with the goal of inspiring a child who dreams of becoming a pilot.\n</think>\n\n<result>\n{\n    \"id\": \"\",\n    \"task_type\": \"write\",\n    \"goal\": \"Write a story of 1000 words for child who likes to become a pilot\",\n    \"dependency\": [],\n    \"length\": \"1000 words\",\n    \"sub_tasks\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"1\",\n            \"task_type\": \"think\",\n            \"goal\": \"Design the main character, plot, setting, and theme for the story.

To create a relatable and inspiring main character for a child who dreams of becoming a pilot, we need to consider several key aspects that will make the character engaging and motivational. The character should embody traits such as curiosity, bravery, and determination, which are essential for someone aspiring to become a pilot. Additionally, the character should be relatable to young readers, meaning they should face challenges and experiences that resonate with a child's world.

1. **Character Background**: 
   - The main character could be a young child, around 10-12 years old, who lives in a small town. This setting allows for a sense of wonder and exploration as the child dreams of the skies beyond their immediate environment.
   - The character's family could have a history of aviation, perhaps a grandparent who was a pilot, which sparks the initial interest in flying.

2. **Personality Traits**:
   - **Curiosity**: The character is always asking questions about how things work, especially anything related to planes and flying. They might have a collection of model airplanes and books about aviation.
   - **Bravery**: Despite being afraid of heights, the character is determined to overcome this fear because their passion for flying is stronger. This internal conflict adds depth to their bravery.
   - **Determination**: The character is persistent in learning about aviation. They might build model airplanes, visit local airfields, or even create a small flight simulator in their room using cardboard and imagination.

3. **Challenges and Growth**:
   - The character could face challenges such as a fear of heights or a lack of resources to pursue flying lessons. These obstacles will require them to be resourceful and creative in finding solutions.
   - They might also encounter skepticism from peers or adults who think their dream is too ambitious, which will test their determination and resolve.

4. **Inspiration and Role Models**:
   - The character could have a mentor figure, perhaps a retired pilot or a teacher who encourages their interest in aviation and provides guidance.
   - Stories of famous pilots or historical aviation events could serve as inspiration for the character, fueling their passion and determination.

5. **Character Development**:
   - Over the course of the story, the character should grow in confidence and skill. They might start by overcoming their fear of heights, then move on to building a working model airplane, and eventually take a discovery flight at a local airfield.
   - Their journey should highlight the importance of perseverance, learning from failures, and the joy of achieving one's dreams.

By crafting a character with these traits and experiences, we can create a story that not only entertains but also inspires young readers to pursue their own dreams with curiosity, bravery, and determination.

   - **Whispering Winds Airfield**: The local airfield is rumored to have magical winds that can lift spirits and dreams. It's said that on certain nights, the winds carry the whispers of legendary pilots, inspiring those who listen.
   - **The Enchanted Hangar**: An old, seemingly abandoned hangar at the edge of the airfield is believed to be enchanted. It's filled with mysterious artifacts and blueprints of fantastical flying machines. Alex often sneaks in to explore and imagine what it would be like to fly these machines.
   - **Skyville's Secret Garden**: A hidden garden near the airfield, where flowers bloom in the shapes of airplanes and the air is filled with the scent of adventure. It's a place where Alex goes to daydream and find inspiration.

3. **Realistic Aviation Settings**:
   - **Mr. Thompson's Workshop**: A cozy, cluttered space filled with model airplanes, flight manuals, and aviation memorabilia. It's where Alex learns about the mechanics of flying and listens to Mr. Thompson's stories.
   - **The Skyville Library**: A treasure trove of aviation books and journals, where Alex spends hours researching and learning about famous pilots and aircraft.
   - **The Observation Hill**: A grassy knoll overlooking the airfield, perfect for watching planes take off and land. It's a favorite spot for Alex and other aviation enthusiasts.

By combining these elements, we create a setting that is both grounded in reality and infused with a sense of wonder and magic. This setting will not only captivate a child's imagination but also serve as a backdrop for Alex's journey towards becoming a pilot, providing opportunities for exploration, learning, and inspiration.
