{"article": "\n\n# MUSE: Latest Developments and Future Plans\n\n## 1. Upcoming Major Developments\n\nThe legendary rock band MUSE is gearing up for an exciting new chapter with their highly anticipated album \"Eclipse,\" scheduled for release on March 20, 2025 [reference:18]. This announcement has generated significant buzz among fans worldwide, as it marks their first studio release since the successful \"Will of the People\" in 2022.\n\nThe band's 2025 world tour plans are taking shape, with an impressive lineup of performances scheduled across multiple continents. The tour will strategically coincide with the release of \"Eclipse,\" allowing fans to experience the new material live alongside classic favorites [reference:18]. The production promises to maintain MUSE's reputation for groundbreaking live performances, featuring their signature combination of theatrical elements and cutting-edge technology.\n\nFestival appearances for 2025 showcase MUSE's continued dominance in the live music scene. A particularly noteworthy highlight is their headlining slot at the Pinkpop Festival in Landgraaf, Netherlands, on June 22, 2025 - marking their triumphant return to the festival after a decade-long absence [reference:20]. The band is also confirmed for several other major European festivals, including Rockfest in Finland, Hellfest in France, Tons of Rock in Oslo, Norway, and STHLM Fields in Stockholm, Sweden [reference:21,25].\n\nLooking further ahead, MUSE has already begun laying groundwork for their next album, targeted for release in 2026. Chris Wolstenholme recently revealed that the band plans to commence work on this project \"in the next couple of months\" [reference:24], suggesting an ambitious creative period ahead for the group.\n\n## 2. Recent Album Success - \"Will of the People\"\n\n\"Will of the People,\" released on August 26, 2022, represents a significant milestone in MUSE's career [reference:1]. The album made history as the first to qualify for charts as an NFT, available in limited copies for £20 [reference:1]. Self-produced by the band - their first such effort since \"The 2nd Law\" in 2012 - the album was recorded across multiple prestigious locations, including Red Room in Santa Monica, Black Lodge in London, and the iconic Abbey Road Studios [reference:1,5].\n\nCommercially, the album has been a resounding success. It became MUSE's seventh consecutive UK number-one album, with impressive first-week sales of 51,500 units [reference:1]. The album's global reach was equally impressive, achieving top positions in multiple countries including Australia, Austria, France, and Italy [reference:2]. By January 2023, global sales had exceeded 300,000 units, earning platinum certification in France and gold status in the UK [reference:1].\n\nCritical reception has been largely positive, with the album receiving a Metacritic score of 71 out of 100 based on 14 professional reviews [reference:1]. Notable praise came from various publications, with Kerrang! awarding it 4/5 stars and Riff Magazine giving it an impressive 9/10 rating. NME particularly lauded it as \"the best music in these years\" [reference:1,3].\n\n## 3. Recent Tours and Performances\n\nThe Will of the People World Tour 2023 has been a spectacular showcase of MUSE's live prowess. The US arena tour kicked off at Chicago's United Center on February 25, 2023, featuring supporting acts Evanescence and One Ok Rock [reference:13]. Memorable performances included shows at Madison Square Garden and the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles, where the band delivered extensive 22-song setlists [reference:11,14].\n\nThe European and Asian legs of the tour were equally impressive, with standout performances at iconic venues like Rome's Stadio Olimpico and London's O2 Arena [reference:9]. The shows have consistently featured elaborate production elements, including a square main stage with catwalk, transparent floor for lighting effects, and custom costumes including masks for specific songs [reference:13].\n\n## 4. Band Members' Activities\n\nChris Wolstenholme has embarked on an exciting new venture with his \"Chromes\" project, releasing two debut singles: \"Imaginary World\" and \"The Good Life\" [reference:25]. This marks his first major project as frontman and lyricist since his contributions to MUSE's \"The 2nd Law\" [reference:25].\n\nMatt Bellamy has been balancing personal and professional developments, recently welcoming his second child while also creating a musical score for Audible's adaptation of George Orwell's \"1984\" [reference:23]. He has also been engaging in public discourse, sharing his perspectives on \"Meta-Centrism\" and various social issues [reference:23].\n\n## 5. Future Outlook and Current Status\n\nMUSE currently stands at an interesting crossroads, operating as an unsigned band while exploring future label options [reference:23,24]. Despite this transition period, their creative output remains strong, with multiple projects in development. The band's current direction suggests a balance between maintaining their signature sound while continuing to push boundaries both musically and technologically. With two albums planned for the next two years and an extensive touring schedule, MUSE appears poised for another exciting chapter in their illustrious career.", "all_search_results": [{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_of_the_People_(album)", "title": "Will of the People (album) - Wikipedia", "position": 1, "publish_time": "Not Provided", "search_query": "Muse Will of the People Wikipedia", "pk_index": 1, "snippet": "Will of the People is the ninth studio album by English rock band Muse, released through Warner Records and Helium-3 on 26 August 2022.

The album was self-produced. It is a genre-hopping album that Matthew Bellamy described as \"a greatest hits album – of new songs.\"[2] \"Won't Stand Down\", \"Compliance\", \"Will of the People\", and \"Kill or Be Killed\" were released as singles before the album was released, and \"You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween\" was released as a single the same day the album came out.\nThe album received generally positive reviews and became Muse's seventh consecutive number-one album in the UK.[3] A world tour in support of the album, the Will of the People World Tour, began in April 2022 and concluded in November 2023.[4][5] It was ranked as the #17 best guitar album of 2022 by Guitar World readers.[6]\nBackground and recording\n[edit]About the origins of the album, Matthew Bellamy related that Warner Records requested a greatest hits album from Muse, but, instead, the band decided to make an album that was a \"montage\" of \"all of those types of genres that we’ve touched on in the past\" and would feel like \"a greatest hits album – of new songs.\"[2] Warner stated that the album spans multiple genres, describing \"Will of the People\" as a \"glam rocker\" and \"Kill or Be Killed\" as \"industrial\".[7]\nBellamy said the lyrics on the album were inspired by \"the increasing uncertainty and instability in the world [...] as the Western empire and the natural world, which have cradled us for so long, are genuinely threatened. This album is a personal navigation through those fears and preparation for what comes next.\"[8]\nThe album was recorded at Bellamy's Red Room studio in Santa Monica, California,[9] as well as at Black Lodge and Abbey Road Studios in London.[10]\nPromotion and release\n[edit]The first snippet from the album was heard on 25 December 2021, when Bellamy briefly livestreamed himself and his 10-year-old son, Bing, listening to the song \"Won't Stand Down\".[11][12] About two weeks later, Muse announced the song would be released on 13 January 2022, making it their first single since \"Pressure\" in September 2018.[12] The second single from the album, \"Compliance\", was released on 17 March, alongside the announcement of the album and its release date of 26 August.[13][14]\nThe third single from the album was the title track, which was released on 1 June 2022.[4][15] That same month, Muse began the European festival leg of their Will of the People World Tour, on which they played all three of the new singles live, as well as a then-unreleased track from the album, \"Kill or Be Killed\".[16] On 21 July, \"Kill or Be Killed\" was released as the album's fourth single.[17][18] On 23 August, Muse announced that a fifth single from the album, \"You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween\", would be released on 26 August, the same day as the release of the album.[19][20]\nAn Italian-language version of \"Ghosts (How Can I Move On)\" featuring Elisa was released on 25 November 2022,[21] and a French-language version featuring Mylène Farmer was released two weeks later, on 9 December.[22]\nOn 1 August 2022, it was announced that Will of the People could be purchased as a non-fungible token (NFT) on the \"eco-friendly\" Polygon-powered platform Serenade, and that it would be the first album for which NFT sales would qualify for the UK and Australian charts.[23][24] Per The Guardian: \"The Muse NFT album will retail for £20 and will be limited to 1,000 copies globally. As both an NFT and a limited-edition format, it is relatively sparse in its offering. Buyers will get a downloadable version of the album – complete with different sleeve – as high-res FLAC files; the members of Muse will digitally sign it and each of the 1,000 buyers will have their names permanently listed on the linked roster of purchasers.\"[24]\nComposition\n[edit]Musically, Will of the People has been described as glam rock,[25][26] alternative rock,[27] synth-pop,[25] arena rock,[25] hard rock,[28] progressive rock,[28] heavy metal,[29] progressive metal,[28] industrial metal,[26] and electropop.[26]\nCritical reception\n[edit]| Aggregate scores | |\n|---|---|\n| Source | Rating |\n| AnyDecentMusic? | 6.5/10[30] |\n| Metacritic | 71/100[31] |\n| Review scores | |\n| Source | Rating |\n| AllMusic | [32] |\n| Clash | 7/10[27] |\n| Classic Rock | [33] |\n| DIY | [34] |\n| Gigwise | [35] |\n| Kerrang! | 4/5[36] |\n| MusicOMH | [37] |\n| NME | [38] |\n| Pitchfork | 3.7/10[39] |\n| Sputnikmusic | 3.5/5[40] |\nWill of the People received generally positive reviews from critics. On Metacritic, it has a normalised score of 71 out of 100 based on 14 mainstream critics, indicating \"generally favourable reviews\".[31] Neil Z. Yeung of AllMusic stated that \"While Will of the People is not as essential as their 2000s classics, it's a quick, satisfying burst of Muse essentials that cleverly forgoes the hits-compilation graveyard in favor of fresh material that honors both their evolution and dedicated fan base.\"[32] Emily Swingle of Clash described the album as \"a sharp, punchy dose of Muse...[despite] lyrics [that] can feel uninspired.\"[27] Writing for Classic Rock, Mark Beaumont wrote, \"Muse master the wider range of future rock and pop sonics they’ve been toying with for the past decade and refine and define their current sound as neatly as Black Holes & Revelations did for their 2000s period.\"[33] Emma Wilkes of DIY called the album \"A smorgasbord of dystopian-flavoured cringe.\"[34] Andrew Belt of Gigwise writes, \"Will of the People is heavy on doom-laden lyrics...Yet it also finds Muse at the top of their game — and having a ball — across ten distinctive songs.\"[35]\nCommercial performance\n[edit]In the UK, the album sold 51,500 units in its first week of release, which was enough to make it Muse's seventh consecutive album to top the UK Albums Chart.[41] In the US, with 24,000 album equivalent units, it debuted at number 15 on the Billboard 200, and number 1 on Billboard's Top Alternative Albums and Top Rock Albums charts.[42] As of January 2023, Will of the People has sold over 300,000 units worldwide.[43]\nTrack listing\n[edit]All tracks are written by Matthew Bellamy.\n| No. | Title | Length |\n|---|---|---|\n| 1. | \"Will of the People\" | 3:18 |\n| 2. | \"Compliance\" | 4:10 |\n| 3. | \"Liberation\" | 3:06 |\n| 4. | \"Won't Stand Down\" | 3:29 |\n| 5. | \"Ghosts (How Can I Move On)\" | 3:36 |\n| 6. | \"You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween\" | 3:00 |\n| 7. | \"Kill or Be Killed\" | 5:00 |\n| 8. | \"Verona\" | 4:56 |\n| 9. | \"Euphoria\" | 3:23 |\n| 10. | \"We Are Fucking Fucked\" | 3:36 |\n| Total length: | 37:40 |\nPersonnel\n[edit]|\nMuse\nAdditional musicians\n|\nTechnical personnel\n|\nArtwork\n|\nCharts\n[edit]\nWeekly charts[edit]\n|\nYear-end charts[edit]\n|\nCertifications\n[edit]| Region | Certification | Certified units/sales |\n|---|---|---|\n| France (SNEP)[86] | Platinum | 100,000‡ |\n| United Kingdom (BPI)[87] | Gold | 100,000‡ |\n|\n‡ Sales+streaming figures based on certification alone. |\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ \"Instagram\".\n- ^ a b Moore, Sam (16 May 2022). \"Matt Bellamy says Muse's 'Will Of The People' is \"a greatest hits album – of new songs\"\".

Nella sua disamina, il critico si è soffermato sulla tendenza del gruppo verso il ricalcare i propri stilemi classici, a discapito della sperimentazione che aveva caratterizzato le pubblicazioni precedenti.[24]\nTracce\n[modifica | modifica wikitesto]Testi e musiche di Matthew Bellamy.\n- Will of the People – 3:18\n- Compliance – 4:10\n- Liberation – 3:06\n- Won't Stand Down – 3:29\n- Ghosts (How Can I Move On) – 3:37\n- You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween – 3:00\n- Kill or Be Killed – 4:59\n- Verona – 4:57\n- Euphoria – 3:23\n- We Are Fucking Fucked – 3:36\nFormazione\n[modifica | modifica wikitesto]Hanno partecipato alle registrazioni, secondo le note di copertina:[25]\n- Gruppo\n- Matthew Bellamy – voce, chitarra tastiera, pianoforte, cori (traccia 1), GuitarViol (traccia 4)[26]\n- Chris Wolstenholme – basso, cori (traccia 1)\n- Dominic Howard – batteria, cori (traccia 1)\n- Altri musicisti (traccia 1)\n- Elle Bellamy – cori\n- Bing Bellamy – cori\n- Caris Wolstenholme – cori\n- Ernie Wostenholme – cori\n- Buster Wolstenholme – cori\n- Teddi Wolstenholme – cori\n- Tabitha Wolstenholme Tolhurst – cori\n- Indiana Wolstenholme Tolhurst – cori\n- Produzione\n- Muse – produzione, ingegneria del suono, direzione artistica\n- Aleks von Korff – produzione aggiuntiva, ingegneria del suono, missaggio al Red Room (traccia 7)\n- Şerban Ghenea – missaggio ai MixStar Studios (eccetto tracce 4 e 7)\n- Bryce Bordone – assistenza al missaggio ai MixStar Studios (eccetto tracce 4 e 7)\n- Chris Gehringer – mastering al Sterling Sound\n- Joe Devenney – assistenza tecnica al Red Room, missaggio al Red Room (traccia 7)\n- Andy Maxwell – assistenza tecnica agli Abbey Road Studios\n- Chris Whitemyer – assistenza tecnica\n- Paul Warren – assistenza tecnica\n- Dan Lancaster – missaggio al The Steam Room Studio (traccia 4)\n- Rhys May – assistenza al missaggio al The Steam Room Studio (traccia 4)\n- Adrian Bushby – ingegneria del suono aggiuntiva (traccia 7)\n- Jesse Less Stout – direzione creativa, direzione artistica, copertina, grafica gatefold\n- Tiago Marinho – copertina, grafica gatefold\n- Tyrone Yarde – copertina, grafica gatefold\n- Gabriella Russo – copertina, grafica gatefold\n- Nick Fancher – fotografia\n- Andrea \"Waarp\" Marcias – grafica retro e CD\nClassifiche\n[modifica | modifica wikitesto]Classifiche settimanali\n[modifica | modifica wikitesto]| Classifica (2022) | Posizione massima |\n|---|---|\n| Australia[27] | 1 |\n| Austria[27] | 1 |\n| Belgio (Fiandre)[27] | 2 |\n| Belgio (Vallonia)[27] | 1 |\n| Canada[28] | 5 |\n| Croazia[29] | 1 |\n| Danimarca[27] | 18 |\n| Finlandia[27] | 2 |\n| Francia[27] | 1 |\n| Germania[27] | 2 |\n| Giappone[30] | 20 |\n| Grecia[31] | 36 |\n| Irlanda[32] | 2 |\n| Islanda[33] | 13 |\n| Italia[27] | 1 |\n| Norvegia[27] | 16 |\n| Nuova Zelanda[27] | 1 |\n| Paesi Bassi[27] | 2 |\n| Polonia[34] | 6 |\n| Portogallo[27] | 1 |\n| Regno Unito[35] | 1 |\n| Repubblica Ceca[36] | 37 |\n| Slovacchia[37] | 51 |\n| Spagna[27] | 2 |\n| Stati Uniti[28] | 15 |\n| Svezia[27] | 27 |\n| Svizzera[27] | 1 |\n| Ungheria[38] | 3 |\nNote\n[modifica | modifica wikitesto]- ^ (EN) Neil Z.

Since a lot has happened during these years, it, thematically, explores everything from Black Lives Matter protests, to the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdowns, to the 2021 Capitol riots, and much more.\nAccording to Muse, \"Will of the People was created in Los Angeles and London and is influenced by increasing uncertainty and instability in the world. A pandemic, new wars in Europe, massive protests & riots, an attempted insurrection, Western democracy wavering, rising authoritarianism, wildfires and natural disasters and the destabilisation of the global order all informed Will of the People. It has been a worrying and scary time for all of us as the Western empire and the natural world, which we have cradled us for so long are genuinely threatened. This album is a personal navigation through those fears and preparation for what comes next.\"[5]\nIn an interview with Zane Lowe, upon announcing the album, on March 17th, 2022, Bellamy said about it, that the label originally planned them to release a best-of compilation of existing songs (later elaborating on that, saying that a \"Best-Of Album\" possibility is in their contract[6]). They instead decided to make a new album, which, musically, encapsulates and recaps the Muse's best work from past albums. As Bellamy said in an interview with a French radio station \"RTL 2\" in June of 2022, with the release of Origin of Muse and Origin of Symmetry's 20th Anniversary Remix, the band listened to a lot of their old music during the writing and recording process, and were thinking about certain things and ideas that they tried to do in the past, but they didn't work out. As an example, he mentioned Kill or Be Killed; Saying that \"2 to 3 times in our career, we've tried to create something that kind of...resembled metal or something, but we couldn't quite go there\".[7] As such, as mentioned by Bellamy on the Zane Lowe interview, the album goes \"all the way, from metal, to pop, to my first version of an Adele piano-like song, to electronica\", featuring songs like Kill or Be Killed, which is \"the best prog metal song they've ever done that could've been on Drones\", becoming a fan-favourite after just a few live performances, and We Are Fucking Fucked, which he sees as \"the weirdest, darkest lost B-side of Muse's life\", while also including songs like Liberation, which is, according to NME, a Queen-like ballad song and Verona, bringing \"purity to the nostalgic electronic textures\", as described by Warner themselves .[8]\nIn the same interview, he mentioned that he let Dom Howard take the lead in terms of decisions on this album, jokingly saying that this is why the album, from start to finish, took so long, saying that Howard took time with the process. On top of that, he added that the album was self-produced by the band themselves,[9] however it was made with help and assistance from Aleks Von Korff.\nTaking in account previous mention of Bellamy's idea of 'era blending' and 'best-of' album, Will of The People presents songs that are reminiscent of their previous albums, Will Of The People harks back to songs like Psycho and Uprising; Compliance seemingly a new feature, presents influences from the 90s with a texture from Simulation Theory; Liberation is a song that could have been released on The Resistance; Won't Stand Down, presents patterns and verses that could have been present on Origin of Symmetry with its metal influence with the strings; Ghosts (How Can I Move On), a song that could be the one that Matt described as an 'Adele type of song'; You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween, a song that could be released Simulation Theory with its 80's inspired sound ala Rockwell's Somebody's Watching Me; Kill or Be Killed, is intriguing due the mix of influences, ranging from Absolution, and Black Holes and Revelations to Drones with its metal riffs; Verona presents sounds similar the ones from The 2nd Law, like Follow Me and Madness, with its synths and U2 esque patterns and riffs; Euphoria, similar to the songs from Simulation Theory, presents synths straight out of the 70s and 80s, similar to the works of Donna Summer and Giorgio Moroder; Finally, the closer, 'We Are Fucking Fucked', presents sounds harking back to Showbiz, Origin of Symmetry and The 2nd Law with a riff similar to Knights of Cydonia.\nBackground\nAfter the Simulation Theory World Tour ended in 2019, Bellamy came up with the idea for the album, which, according to his interview with NME, was that they'd \"make it a bit more about what’s actually happening in the world right now\", adding \"what I didn’t know was what was about to happen.\" [10] Later, in January of 2020, Matt first publicly hinted at working on new Muse material in an interview with ALT 98.7 FM, backstage at the ALTerEGO Festival. He said that the goal for 2020 was to work on new Muse material. The plans were brought to halt due to the coronavirus pandemic, as the three were unable to get together due to the lockdowns. Bellamy instead focused on releasing his solo material. Later that year, in May, Matt further hinted on working on Muse material in an interview with Zane Lowe on Beats 1 Radio, saying that he has a few pieces written that are suited for Muse.[11] In an interview with Rolling Stone, also in May, he said that that the idea would be to record the album in 2021 and go on a tour in 2022.[12]\nLater, in 2021, Bellamy further confirmed that work on the new Muse album has begun, in an interview with The Jaded Hearts Club Band for The Sun.[13] Bellamy said the following: \"I started writing when all the protests and all the chaos were kicking off. It’s a weird thing to say but it suits the music I write. It keeps you a little bit on edge.\" Additionally, Bellamy jokingly said, in an Instagram comment reply on Dom Howard's Instagram post, that the album would include \"emotional gasps and many usages of the word ‘soul’.\".\nBellamy also had once got imbued with the recent label's request to release the greatest hits album of Muse's iconic songs from each eighth album they recorded, but they turned down the request and instead, they decide to produce a new album that combined with all various sounds and influences from each of their previous album into a new and fresh package with an additional comment by him as \"a greatest hits album - of a new songs - essentially\" [14] during Matt's interview with NME and the band interview with French radio talk show.\nThe album, and its release date (August 26th, 2022) was finally announced on March 17th, 2022, together with the release of Compliance. The announcement, being six months apart from the release date, was met with mixed feelings from fans, however, since then, one more song has been released, another one performed live, and the fourth song still planned to be released before the album drops. Ordering the album from the official muse.mu website gives the buyer an exclusive chance to access the ticket pre-sale code for future gigs.\nRecording\nIn a 2019 interview with NME, Bellamy said that he'd like the idea of the band \"totally resetting\" and going back to their hometown of Teignmouth, Devon to rehearse and record the album. This was, however, not the case, as the first studio pictures that started to emerge were from Bellamy's own studio, named the Red Room, located in downtown Santa Monica, California, where, in March of 2021, the first proof of Muse being in the studio came from[15] The album was both written and part-recorded in the studio. With Chris in the UK and the rest of the band in the USA, and with all the lockdowns, this was mostly done remotely. Producer Aleks Von Korff, who previously worked with Muse as an engineer on Simulation Theory, and produced Bellamy's solo material - songs like Tomorrow's World - also posted a picture from Red Room during that time, with the wooden Kawai piano.\nBetween April and June 2021, the band took a break from recording, to work on a remix of Origin of Symmetry. In early June, Matt and Dom joined Chris in the UK, continuing work on the album.[16] With the entire band back together in person, recording continued at Abbey Road Studios in London, in the summer of 2021. The band were also joined by Muse's long-time engineer, Adrian Bushby, who posted a picture of him and Howard at Abbey Road Studios tracking drums.[17] This makes the upcoming album the second LP to be partially recorded at Abbey Road, after 20 years, when Origin of Symmetry was recorded at the facility. The album appears to have also been partially recorded at RAK Studios at the end of 2021, with Tre Cool from Green Day mentioned meeting up with Muse during their stay at the studio whilst recording their album, Saviors.[18]\nOn December 1st, 2021, Chris Gehringer, mastering engineer at Sterling Sound Studios posted a picture of Bellamy and Howard sitting on a couch, with the entire album at the mastering stage during that time. [19]\nRelease\nOn December 25th, 2021, Bellamy made up for the lack of a muse.mu Christmas present with a short livestream from his Tesla, on Muse's Instagram profile, showcasing part of Won't Stand Down. The 60 second stream was then screen-recorded by a few people, with copyright bots deleting the posts, hinting at the song being near its release. Matt's minute-long stream can be listened to here. The then-approaching release of the song was teased once again on Muse's New Years Eve Instagram post, when they wrote a caption saying \"Looking forward to WSD. We'll see you on the other side!\", before quickly replacing \"WSD\" with \"2022\". Won't Stand Down was subsequently announced a week later, on January 7th, 2022, on Muse's social media[21], with wontstanddown.muse.mu spotted being online a day earlier. Together with it also came the single artwork and a new promo image of the band. The song was released on January 13th, 2022, on digital platforms.\nAlmost two months later, on March 2nd, 2022, Bellamy posted an Instagram story in which he went over the guitar tuning for Won't Stand Down, while mentioning that a second heavy song will appear on the album.[22]\nOn March 9th, 2022, Muse posted a short, half-minute album teaser video on their YouTube, simply titled \"MUSE\", which depicts statues of the band's heads being torn down by a group of rioters in the middle of a desert, while wearing mirror masks from the Won't Stand Down music video, with a choir of Matts chanting the line \"The Will of the People\", name of the album and title track, with album artwork displayed at the very end of the video.[23]\nTwo days later, on March 11th, 2022, it was discovered by Muse fans that the index code from wontstanddown.muse.mu, contains basic album info, including the tracklist and anagrams for each song which will appear on the album. The same day, Muse announced a new song/single, Compliance. The song, and its music video, leaked on March 15th through Vimeo, before being deleted from the platform on the same day. A day later, anagrams from the wontstanddown index code were also resolved, leaking song titles and the tracklist. Compliance's music video was announced together with the album name on March 16th[24].\nThe album's release date has finally been announced, together with the release of Compliance, on March 17th, 2022. It is available for pre-ordering via willofthepeople.muse.mu and is set to be released on August 26th, 2022.\nMatt reportedly said, to one of the fans after one of the London Apollo charity gigs, in May of 2022, that they intend to release two more songs before the album drops. A day after the second gig, on May 11th, Apple Music began to show the track duration for the title song, while a few days later, on May 13th, a release date for the song was set up for it on Amazon.[25] This led fans to speculate, that Will of the People would be the next single from the album. The song was later leaked on May 26th, 2022, while the official release date of June 1st was announced a day later, on May 27th.\nAfter being played on every gig of the Will of the People Summer Festivals Tour in June & July of 2022, it was announced by Muse on July 13th, 2022, that Kill or Be Killed would be the next song to be released from the album. It was released on July 21st, 2022, at 3PM BST.[26] This is also the last single before the album drop.\nDue to the fact that some people were able to get hold of the album earlier, on August 22nd, short snippets (phone recordings) of the unreleased songs from the album were leaked on Twitter, exception being We Are Fucking Fucked.[27] A day later, on August 23rd, the fifth single was announced by Muse, being You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween. The single, and it's music video, are due to be released on August 26th, together with the album.\nOn August 1st, 2022, it was announced, that Will of the People would also be releasing as an NFT, available on the platform called \"Serenade\".[28] Limited to 1000 copies, it is the first new music format to be charted in the UK since 2015, when music streaming data started counting in the charts, alongside CD, LP and download sales. The NFT cover art is slightly different to the standard one, featuring a purple/blue colour scheme, instead of the orange/blue one, and also featuring Muse's signatures on the digital cover itself.\nOn November 24th, 2022, it was announced by Muse that a new single, Ghosts (How Can I Move On), featuring Italian singer, Elisa Toffoli would be released the next day.\nOn December 9th, 2022, Ghosts (How Can I Move On) was announced to have a second single, featuring French singer, Mylène Farmer and was released simultaneously.\nCritical Reception\nAfter the release, Metacritic scored the album in 71 out of 100, indicating the generally positive and favourable reviews. It was also commercially successful to become the Muse's seventh UK No.1 album. NME described the ninth album as their \"best music in these years\" and more respectable than their previous awkward trend-chasing album \"Simulation Theory\"[29]. Won't Stand Down and Kill or Be Killed have been appointed as the greatest sounds of all Muse's track by some mainstream critics, praising the styles and bringing the best composition into this album, implying those two tracks is going to be the new Stockholm Syndrome\nCritic also spotted the last track, We Are Fucking Fucked, as a perfect closer to highlighting the straightforward lyrics that deliver the powerful chorus, which is giving a throwback to Showbiz and Black Holes and Revelations era.\nThe album was well-received amongst critics, with Kerrang rating it 4/5[30], and Riff Magazine rating it 9/10[31]. Mark Beaumont of Classic Rock Magazine also rated the album 9/10,[32] while Record Collector rated Will of the People with four stars and Gigwise gave the album a score of 8/10.[33]\nArtwork & Design\nWith Jesse Lee Stout back as their creative director, all the design and creative elements from the live shows, the music videos, and the rest of the art, are again intertwined with each other, like during Simulaiton Theory. The first design element of the album was the monogram (shown in the picture), consisting of letters \"W\", \"O\", \"T\" and \"P\". It first appeared on the single artwork for Won't Stand Down.and was already speculated at that time, that the monogram might be linked to the album name. The monogram makes appearances throughout the entirety of the album era.\nThe artwork, made by Portuguese digital artist Tiago Marinho, is set somewhere in a post-apocalyptic city, located in the middle of some desert (the design is very similar to the post-apocalyptic London, shown on the Sing for Absolution single artwork), and shows large demolished statues of the band's heads, with a group of rioters, later revealed to be the \"masked hackers\", standing next to them. The character of this \"masked hacker\", also dubbed as \"Will\" (hailing from the album's name), wears a reflective mask, which, like the monogram, also appears throughout the entire album cycle.\nOn the cover, each of the three demolished heads has graffiti sprayed all over them. These include the WOTP monograms scattered on each of the heads, aswel as names of songs. Other words written as graffiti include \"Die\" and \"Fuck off\" on Matt's head, both lines from the songs. Dom's head also includes \"IX\" written on it in Roman numerals, standing for the album being their ninth one. This is the first artwork since Black Holes and Revelations to not feature the Muse logo, or the album name on the art itself. It is also the second album artwork in a row / second main album artwork alltogether, to feature the bands' faces.\nThe story behind the album artwork is represented in the music video for the single, Will of the People.\nTouring\nOn March 20th, 2022, several fans have spotted graffiti and stickers with the, then unknown monogram, in and around the Shepherd's Bush Empire area in the Shepherd's Bush district of London, UK. It was unknown what exactly this meant at the time. Some have suggested that it was just a marketing campaign, while others have suggested a surprise show was going to take place soon.[34][35][36] Two fundraising concerts, in support of the album, were announced a week after the graffiti started to appear, on March 28th, which took place on May 9th and May 10th, at London's Eventim Apollo. Muse supported War Child & Médecins Sans Frontières on night one, and The Big Issue on night two.[37] Prior to the two shows, a very small gig, kept in complete secrecy, was performed on April 7th, 2022, at Exeter's Cavern Club. The gig was recorded for \"Jim Beam's Welcome Sessions\".\nThe Will of the People Festivals Tour was the first largest tour of the album era. It took place between summer and winter of 2022. The band headlined festivals across Europe, with an additional few gigs on U.S. festivals. The show itself, at times, loosely resembled that of Simulation Theory World Tour's, having a large Murph-inspired inflatable figure on stage, overlooking the band and the crowd, and \"The Power Glove\" returning. During the festivals tour, a smaller tour, called the Will Of The People Theatre Tour, was announced in June of 2022. On it, Muse were performing in smaller venues across Europe and the USA. Some of them haven't seen Muse perform live in almost 20 years. The tour took place during the main legs of the festivals tour, in October 2022.\nA bigger headlining tour is currently taking place, including both indoor, outdoor and festival shows. The tour began in Mexico in January of 2023, headed to North America in the spring and Europe in the summer, before finishing off in Kuala Lumpur in August of 2023.\nTracklist\nCD/Digital\n- Will of the People – 3:18\n- Compliance – 4:10\n- Liberation – 3:06\n- Won't Stand Down – 3:29\n- Ghosts (How Can I Move On) – 3:37\n- You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween – 3:00\n- Kill or Be Killed – 4:59\n- Verona – 4:57\n- Euphoria – 3:23\n- We Are Fucking Fucked – 3:36\nVinyl\nSide A (One)\n- Will of the People – 3:18\n- Compliance – 4:10\n- Liberation – 3:06\n- Won't Stand Down – 3:29\n- Ghosts (How Can I Move On) – 3:37\nSide B (Two)\n- You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween – 3:00\n- Kill or Be Killed – 4:59\n- Verona – 4:57\n- Euphoria – 3:23\n- We Are Fucking Fucked – 3:36\nCassette\nSide A\n- Will of the People – 3:18\n- Compliance – 4:10\n- Liberation – 3:06\n- Won't Stand Down – 3:29\n- Ghosts (How Can I Move On) – 3:37\nSide B\n- You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween – 3:00\n- Kill or Be Killed – 4:59\n- Verona – 4:57\n- Euphoria – 3:23\n- We Are Fucking Fucked – 3:36\nWill of the People gallery\nPersonnel\nMuse\n- Matt Bellamy - Vocals, backing vocals, crowd vocals (tracks 1, 10), guitar, guitarviol (tracks 3 & 4), keyboards, piano, synth programming, production, art direction\n- Chris Wolstenholme - Bass, backing vocals, crowd vocals (track 1), production, art direction\n- Dominic Howard - Drums, percussion, drum programming, crowd vocals (track 1), production, art direction\nAdditional performers\n- Elle Bellamy - Crowd vocals (track 1)\n- Bing Bellamy - Crowd vocals (track 1)\n- Caris Wolstenholme - Crowd vocals (track 1)\n- Ernie Wolstenholme - Crowd vocals (track 1)\n- Buster Wolstenholme - Crowd vocals (track 1)\n- Teddi Wolstenholme - Crowd vocals (track 1)\n- Tabitha Wolstenholme Tolhurst - Crowd vocals (track 1)\n- Indiana Wolstenholme Tolhurst - Crowd vocals (track 1)\nProduction\n- Aleks Von Korff - Additional production, engineering, mixing (track 7)\n- Adrian Bushby - Additional engineering (track 7)\n- Joe Devenney - Engineering assistant\n- Serban Ghenea - Mixing (tracks 1-3, 5-6, 8-10)\n- Bryce Bordone - Mixing engineer (tracs 1-3, 5-6, 8-10)\n- Dan Lancaster - Mixing (track 4)\n- Rhys May - Mixing assistant (track 4)\n- Chris Whitemyer - Technical assistant\n- Paul Warren - Technical assistant\n- Andy Maxwell - Abbey Road assistance\n- Tommy Bosustow - Abbey Road assistance\n- Chris Gehringer - Mastering\nArt\n- Jesse Lee Stout - Creative direction, artwork (gatefold)\n- Tiago Marinho - Artwork (front cover, gatefold, NFT cover)\n- Andrea “Waarp” Marcias - Artwork (back cover, poster art, LP side A)\n- Miko del Rosario - Artwork (LP side B)\n- Gabriella Russo - Artwork (gatefold)\n- Tyrone Yarde - Artwork (gatefold)\n- Nick Fancher - Photography\nNinth album recording gallery\n\"Might as well!

Il est le successeur de Simulation Theory, paru en 2018. L'album a été écrit à Los Angeles et enregistré en 2021 au studio Abbey Road à Londres, tout juste 20 ans après Origin of Symmetry, dernier album du groupe ayant été enregistré dans ce studio[2].\nLe premier single issu de l'album, Won't Stand Down, est publié le [3]. Trois autres singles sortent par la suite : Compliance, Will of the People, Kill or Be Killed puis un cinquième le jour de la sortie de l’album : You Make Me Feel Like It’s Halloween. Ghosts (How Can I Move On) sortira en Novembre 2022 en single hors album avec deux collaborations.\nAvec 10 morceaux et 37 minutes 35 secondes, il s'agit de l’album le plus court de la discographie du groupe et le premier album de l’industrie musicale à sortir au format NFT.\nDéveloppement\n[modifier | modifier le code]Après s'être essayé dans deux projets musicaux en 2020, un album avec le supergroupe The Jaded Hearts Club et des compositions en solo, Matthew Bellamy annonce dans le numéro d'août 2020 de Total Guitar et sur la page Facebook officielle du groupe le 3 août 2020 un retour en studio du groupe, probablement dès 2021, pour l’enregistrement de l'album, successeur de Simulation Theory paru en 2018. Cette fois-ci, l'album ne sera pas dirigé par Matt, mais pas Dominic Howard[4].\nÀ l’origine, Warner Bros., le label du groupe, souhaitait un best of des plus gros succès du groupe. Ce dernier refuse et Matthew Bellamy propose à la place des compositions originales qui seraient chacune la « meilleure version de chaque style ». Il déclare au média MetalZone : « Nous étions arrivés à un point où il était question de faire un album de nos plus grands succès, et nous n’étions pas vraiment en faveur de cela. Donc on a presque fait un disque qui est une compilation de nos plus grands succès – mais avec de nouvelles chansons. Cela signifie que cet album contient un morceau de Metal – et c’est comme, le meilleur morceau de Metal que nous ayons jamais fait. Et il y a une sorte de ballade douce, une chanson d’amour, et c’est probablement la meilleure ballade d’amour qu’on ait jamais faite, et ainsi de suite. »[5].\nLe , Matthew Bellamy fait un direct Instagram avec le compte du groupe à bord de sa voiture dans les rues de Los Angeles, accompagné de son fils, où il dévoile un extrait d'un morceau inédit intitulé Won't Stand Down en fond sonore. Le morceau se présente comme le plus heavy metal de la discographie du groupe[6]. Le , le titre, la pochette et la date de sortie du single sont officiellement annoncés par le groupe sur les réseaux sociaux[7].\nLe , une courte vidéo postée par le groupe sur YouTube donne des indications sur la pochette de l'album et sur les titres qui composeront celui-ci. Deux jours plus tard, le deuxième single de l'album Compliance est annoncé sur les réseaux sociaux pour une sortie le jeudi [8]. Le single Compliance est alors publié sur les plateformes de streaming. Lors de cette sortie, le groupe dévoilet officiellement la date de sortie de l'album fixé au ainsi que la pochette, les pistes de l'album et les formats de sortie.\nLe troisième single éponyme de l’album, Will of the People, sort le 1er juin 2022. Quelques jours plus tard, le groupe dévoile Kill or Be Killed, un quatrième extrait inédit de l’album lors du festival Rock am Ring en Allemagne[9], festival d’ouverture de la tournée d’été. Le titre sort officiellement le . Le , jour de la sortie de l'album, paraît You Make Me Feel Like It’s Halloween, cinquième extrait de l'album ainsi que le clip vidéo, à l'effigie des films d'horreur mythiques des années 1970-2000 comme Halloween, Scream, Vendredi 13, L'Exorciste, Misery, Shining, etc.\nLe 25 novembre 2022, sort le sixième single, Ghosts (How Can I Move On). Il est accompagné d’une face-B, une version de la chanson en duo avec la chanteuse italienne Elisa Toffoli[10],[11]. Deux semaines plus tard, une version en français sort en duo avec la chanteuse Mylène Farmer[12],[13],[14].\nL'album\n[modifier | modifier le code]Artworks (album et singles)\n[modifier | modifier le code]La pochette de l'album est dévoilée le à l’occasion de la sortie du deuxième extrait Compliance. Elle représente les têtes géantes sculptées en pierre des trois membres du groupe à moitié ensevelies et endommagées. Les visages sont tagués du monogramme « WOTP ». L’atmosphère lumineuse orangée et apocalyptique évoque un côté dramatique comme lors des incendies géants. Il s'agit du premier album depuis Black Holes and Revelations (2006) à ne pas faire apparaitre le logo du groupe sur la pochette et du deuxième album après Simulation Theory (2018) à faire apparaitre le visage des membres du groupe.\nL'artwork de Won't Stand Down représente le personnage de Kueen, vêtu d'une toge noire à capuche et un masque métallique couvrant tout son visage survolant dix disciples casqués. Le nom du groupe est inscrit au centre, sous lequel se trouve le nom du morceau ainsi qu'un monogramme formé par la superposition des lettres W, O, T et P (initiales du titre de l'album Will of the People). Ce logo se retrouve également sur les costumes des disciples dans le clip de Won't Stand Down.\nDans une courte vidéo publiée sur leur page internet le 8 mars 2022, le titre Will of the People est répété en boucle, qui correspondrait ainsi au monogramme WOTP visible dans le clip de Won't Stand Down.\nLe photographe chargé de la communication du groupe pour cet album est Nick Fancher.\nThèmes\n[modifier | modifier le code]D'après le groupe sur le réseau social Instagram dans un texte en vidéo posté le 16 mars 2022, Will Of The People a été créé à Los Angeles et à Londres. Il est influencé par l'augmentation de l'instabilité dans le monde, la pandémie du COVID-19, la guerre en Ukraine, manifestations et émeutes massives à travers le globe, une tentative d'insurrection, des démocraties occidentales vacillantes, la montée de l'autoritarisme, les catastrophes naturelles liées aux changements climatiques comme les incendies de forêt[15],[16].\nD’après Matthew Bellamy dans le magazine Metalzone à propos du premier single, « “Won’t Stand Down est une chanson qui parle de se défendre contre les brutes, que ce soit dans la cour de récréation, au travail ou ailleurs. [Cette chanson parle de] se protéger de la coercition et de la manipulation sociopathique et d’affronter l’adversité avec force, confiance et agressivité.” »[17].\nDans une vidéo publiée les , le groupe donne une définition au mot « compliance », à propos du morceau du même nom : « La compliance est une promesse de sécurité et réconfort qui nous est vendue par les puissants en temps de vulnérabilité. Les gangs, les gouvernements, les démagogues, les médias sociaux, les algorithmes et les religions nous séduisent par des tromperies de contrevérités et des fables réconfortantes. Ils veulent nous faire adhérer à leur vision étroite du monde, nous faire obéir et fermer les yeux sur nos propres voix intérieure de la raison et de la compassion. Ils ont juste besoin de notre compliance. »[8]. Cette définition donnée par le groupe établie que les entités dites « supérieures » manipulent les foules en modifiant la vision des sociétés, les idées en la modelant à leur propre valeurs, une vision étriquée et non tolérante[18].\nSonorités\n[modifier | modifier le code]L'album est principalement composé de sonorités rock et acoustiques. Il s'agit de l'album le moins électronique des dernières décennies de la discographie du groupe. Un seul morceau, Verona, est principalement électronique. Le reste de l'album alterne des chansons rock, glam rock, nu metal ou encore acoustique au piano. En avril 2021, le batteur Dominic Howard déclare que l'album « sonne lourd »[19]. Won't Stand Down, le premier extrait de l'album a des sonorités rock et Heavy metal[20].\nListe des pistes\n[modifier | modifier le code]| No | Titre | Durée | |||||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1. | Will of the People | 3:18 | |||||||\n| 2. | Compliance | 4:10 | |||||||\n| 3. | Liberation | 3:06 | |||||||\n| 4. | Won't Stand Down | 3:29 | |||||||\n| 5. | Ghosts (How Can I Move On) | 3:37 | |||||||\n| 6. | You Make Me Feel Like It’s Halloween | 3:00 | |||||||\n| 7. | Kill or Be Killed | 4:59 | |||||||\n| 8. | Verona | 4:57 | |||||||\n| 9. | Euphoria | 3:23 | |||||||\n| 10. | We Are Fucking Fucked | 3:26 | |||||||\n| 37:35 |\nFormats de l'album\n[modifier | modifier le code]La liste des titres est dévoilée le 17 mars 2022 lors de l'annonce officielle de l'album et de la sortie du single \"Compliance\" le même jour.

Elle a été réalisée par le réalisateur anglais Jeremi Durand. Elle met en scène les membres du groupe grimés de masques interprétés par six comédiens, trois pour les personnages enfants de Muse et trois pour les personnages adultes.

The album was self-produced. It is a genre-hopping album that Matthew Bellamy described as \"a greatest hits album – of new songs.\"[2] \"Won't Stand Down\", \"Compliance\", \"Will of the People\", and \"Kill or Be Killed\" were released as singles before the album was released, and \"You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween\" was released as a single the same day the album came out.\nThe album received generally positive reviews and became Muse's seventh consecutive number-one album in the UK.[3] A world tour in support of the album, the Will of the People World Tour, began in April 2022 and concluded in November 2023.[4][5] It was ranked as the #17 best guitar album of 2022 by Guitar World readers.[6]\nRemove ads\nBackground and recording\nAbout the origins of the album, Matthew Bellamy related that Warner Records requested a greatest hits album from Muse, but, instead, the band decided to make an album that was a \"montage\" of \"all of those types of genres that we’ve touched on in the past\" and would feel like \"a greatest hits album – of new songs.\"[2] Warner stated that the album spans multiple genres, describing \"Will of the People\" as a \"glam rocker\" and \"Kill or Be Killed\" as \"industrial\".[7]\nBellamy said the lyrics on the album were inspired by \"the increasing uncertainty and instability in the world [...] as the Western empire and the natural world, which have cradled us for so long, are genuinely threatened. This album is a personal navigation through those fears and preparation for what comes next.\"[8]\nThe album was recorded at Bellamy's Red Room studio in Santa Monica, California,[9] as well as at Black Lodge and Abbey Road Studios in London.[10]\nRemove ads\nPromotion and release\nSummarize\nPerspective\nThe first snippet from the album was heard on 25 December 2021, when Bellamy briefly livestreamed himself and his 10-year-old son, Bing, listening to the song \"Won't Stand Down\".[11][12] About two weeks later, Muse announced the song would be released on 13 January 2022, making it their first single since \"Pressure\" in September 2018.[12] The second single from the album, \"Compliance\", was released on 17 March, alongside the announcement of the album and its release date of 26 August.[13][14]\nThe third single from the album was the title track, which was released on 1 June 2022.[4][15] That same month, Muse began the European festival leg of their Will of the People World Tour, on which they played all three of the new singles live, as well as a then-unreleased track from the album, \"Kill or Be Killed\".[16] On 21 July, \"Kill or Be Killed\" was released as the album's fourth single.[17][18] On 23 August, Muse announced that a fifth single from the album, \"You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween\", would be released on 26 August, the same day as the release of the album.[19][20]\nAn Italian-language version of \"Ghosts (How Can I Move On)\" featuring Elisa was released on 25 November 2022,[21] and a French-language version featuring Mylène Farmer was released two weeks later, on 9 December.[22]\nOn 1 August 2022, it was announced that Will of the People could be purchased as a non-fungible token (NFT) on the \"eco-friendly\" Polygon-powered platform Serenade, and that it would be the first album for which NFT sales would qualify for the UK and Australian charts.[23][24] Per The Guardian: \"The Muse NFT album will retail for £20 and will be limited to 1,000 copies globally. As both an NFT and a limited-edition format, it is relatively sparse in its offering. Buyers will get a downloadable version of the album – complete with different sleeve – as high-res FLAC files; the members of Muse will digitally sign it and each of the 1,000 buyers will have their names permanently listed on the linked roster of purchasers.\"[24]\nRemove ads\nComposition\nMusically, Will of the People has been described as glam rock,[25][26] alternative rock,[27] synth-pop,[25] arena rock,[25] hard rock,[28] progressive rock,[28] heavy metal,[29] progressive metal,[28] industrial metal,[26] and electropop.[26]\nCritical reception\nSummarize\nPerspective\nWill of the People received generally positive reviews from critics. On Metacritic, it has a normalised score of 71 out of 100 based on 14 mainstream critics, indicating \"generally favourable reviews\".[31] Neil Z. Yeung of AllMusic stated that \"While Will of the People is not as essential as their 2000s classics, it's a quick, satisfying burst of Muse essentials that cleverly forgoes the hits-compilation graveyard in favor of fresh material that honors both their evolution and dedicated fan base.\"[32] Emily Swingle of Clash described the album as \"a sharp, punchy dose of Muse...[despite] lyrics [that] can feel uninspired.\"[27] Writing for Classic Rock, Mark Beaumont wrote, \"Muse master the wider range of future rock and pop sonics they’ve been toying with for the past decade and refine and define their current sound as neatly as Black Holes & Revelations did for their 2000s period.\"[33] Emma Wilkes of DIY called the album \"A smorgasbord of dystopian-flavoured cringe.\"[34] Andrew Belt of Gigwise writes, \"Will of the People is heavy on doom-laden lyrics...Yet it also finds Muse at the top of their game — and having a ball — across ten distinctive songs.\"[35]\nRemove ads\nCommercial performance\nIn the UK, the album sold 51,500 units in its first week of release, which was enough to make it Muse's seventh consecutive album to top the UK Albums Chart.[41] In the US, with 24,000 album equivalent units, it debuted at number 15 on the Billboard 200, and number 1 on Billboard's Top Alternative Albums and Top Rock Albums charts.[42] As of January 2023, Will of the People has sold over 300,000 units worldwide.[43]\nRemove ads\nTrack listing\nAll tracks are written by Matthew Bellamy.\nPersonnel\nSummarize\nPerspective\n|\nMuse\nAdditional musicians\n|\nTechnical personnel\n|\nArtwork\n|\nRemove ads\nCharts\nSummarize\nPerspective\nRemove ads\nCertifications\nReferences\nWikiwand - on\nSeamless Wikipedia browsing.

Het album werd uitgebracht op 26 augustus 2022. De band was zelf verantwoordelijk voor de productie. Er werden vier singles uitgebracht voorafgaand aan het verschijnen van het album; 'Won't Stand Down', 'Compliance', 'Will of the People' en 'Kill or Be Killed'. De vijfde single van het album, 'You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween', werd uitgebracht op dezelfde dag dat het volledige album verscheen. Will of the People werd digitaal uitgebracht op verschillende streamingdiensten en op cd, vinyl en muziekcassette.\nAchtergrond\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]Het album werd opgenomen in Londen en Los Angeles. Volgens frontman Matthew Bellamy is het album beïnvloed door \"the increasing uncertainty and instability in the world.\" In een verklaring noemde hij onder andere de coronapandemie, oorlog in Europa (de Russische invasie van Oekraïne in 2022), grote onrust onder de bevolking en natuurrampen.[1] De band werd aangespoord om een greatest hits-album te maken, maar dat wezen de bandleden af. Will of the People bevat een mengelmoes van de verschillende genres die de band in het verleden heeft gespeeld en is in dat opzicht het antwoord geworden op het verzoek.[2]\nWill of the People World Tour\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]Op 7 april 2022 ving the Will of the People World Tour aan. Op die dag gaf de band het startschot van de tournee in de vorm van een besloten concert in Exeter.[3][4] Tot en met september werden er optredens verzorgd tijdens festivals in Europa. Vanaf oktober tot en met juni 2023 zijn er wereldwijd shows gepland. Muse wierf producer Dan Lancaster voor de liveband. Lancaster had eerder de single 'Won't Stand Down' gemixt.[5]\nOntvangst\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]Het album werd overwegend positief ontvangen. Op Metacritic kreeg Will of the People op basis van 11 recensies een gewogen gemiddelde score van 78/100, wat neerkomt op \"Generally favorable reviews\".[6] In de Benelux werd het album gematigd positief ontvangen. Zowel Alexander van Eenennaam van het Algemeen Dagblad als Gijsbert Kamer van de Volkskrant gaven twee van vijf sterren.[7][8] Floor Deckx van De Standaard gaf drie van vijf sterren.[9]\nNummers\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]| Nr. | Titel | Duur | |||||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1. | Will of the People | 3:18 | |||||||\n| 2. | Compliance | 4:10 | |||||||\n| 3. | Liberation | 3:06 | |||||||\n| 4. | Won't Stand Down | 3:30 | |||||||\n| 5. | Ghosts (How Can I Move On) | 3:36 | |||||||\n| 6. | You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween | 3:00 | |||||||\n| 7. | Kill or Be Killed | 5:00 | |||||||\n| 8. | Verona | 4:56 | |||||||\n| 9. | Euphoria | 3:23 | |||||||\n| 10. | We Are Fucking Fucked | 3:36 | |||||||\n| Totale duur: 37:35 |\nBezetting\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]- Matthew Bellamy – zang, gitaren, keyboard\n- Christopher Wolstenholme – basgitaar, zang\n- Dominic Howard – drums\nHitnoteringen\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]Nederlandse Album Top 100\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]| Hitnotering: (Week 1 t/m 7) 03-09-2022 t/m 15-10-2022 Hitnotering: (Week 8) 29-10-2022 Hitnotering: (Week 9 t/m 10) 10-06-2023 t/m 17-06-2023 | ||||||||||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Week: | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | ||\n| Positie: | 2 | 9 | 11 | 19 | 17 | 42 | 78 | uit | 94 | uit | 63 | 81 |\nVlaamse Ultratop 200 Albums\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]| Hitnotering: (Week 1 t/m 13) 03-09-2022 t/m 26-11-2022 Hitnotering: (Week 14 t/m 16) 10-12-2022 t/m 24-12-2022 Hitnotering: (Week 17) 08-07-2023 | |||||||||||||||||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Week: | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | ||\n| Positie: | 2 | 8 | 20 | 21 | 17 | 37 | 85 | 143 | 100 | 106 | 83 | 143 | 143 | uit | 150 | 125 | 129 | uit | 155 |\nExterne links\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]- (en) Will of the People op Discogs\n- (en) Will of the People op Muse.mu\n- (en) Will of the People op MuseWiki\n- ↑ (en) Moore, Sam, Muse announce new album ‘Will Of The People’ and share new single ‘Compliance’.

The song is intended to be a \"populist parody, almost the antithesis to 'Uprising',\" another Muse song with a similar anti-establishment theme that instead \"[takes] it seriously.\"[8]\nMusic video\neditThe music video for \"Will of the People\" was released on 1 June 2022 at 15:00 BST (UTC+1), the same day as the single was released. The music video for \"Will of the People\" follows on from the videos for previous singles \"Won't Stand Down\" and \"Compliance\", continuing the same themes and following the same characters.[4]\nThe video, directed and animated by Tom Teller,[4] is set in a dystopian city in which a revolution takes place. The video opens with a person receiving a delivery of a metallic mask, the same as the mask featured in the \"Won't Stand Down\" and \"Compliance\" music videos; he is later revealed to be Will the Hacker, the leader of the revolution. As the video progresses, a growing number of revolutionaries advance through the city,[7] destroying security cameras, spraying \"Will of the People\" logo graffiti onto walls, tearing down statues and attacking the building belonging to the Ministry of Truth,[9] in reference to George Orwell's dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four.\nAs the Ministry of Truth building explodes and continues to burn, the city's electricity supply and mobile phone signals are shut down in an attempt to smother the revolution. The leaders of the revolution depart the city in futuristic supercars,[7] resembling Tesla Cybertrucks, heading into the desert as the skyline of the city burns behind them.[7][9] In the desert the revolutionaries find three ancient statues of the faces of band members Matt Bellamy, Dominic Howard and Chris Wolstenholme carved in the style of Mount Rushmore; they are destroyed by being pulled to the ground with cables, before being covered in \"Will of the People\" logo graffiti. Three members take off their masks, revealing themselves as the members of Muse.[7][9]\nThe music video for \"Will of the People\" references multiple forms of popular culture; as well as Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, the video has been compared to \"V for Vendetta set in [the] Blade Runner 2049 universe\".[4]\nPersonnel\neditCredits adapted from Tidal.[10]\nMuse\n- Matt Bellamy – lead vocals, guitars, composition, production, engineering\n- Chris Wolstenholme – bass guitar, production, engineering\n- Dominic Howard – drums, production, engineering\nProduction\n- Aleks Von Korff – additional production, engineering\n- Chris Gehringer – mastering\n- Serban Ghenea – mixing\n- Bryce Bordone – mixing engineer\n- Andy Maxwell – studio assistant\n- Joe Devenney – studio assistant\n- Tommy Bosustow – studio assistant\n- Chris Whitemyer – technical assistant\n- Paul Warren – technical assistant\nCharts\nedit| Chart (2022) | Peak position |\n|---|---|\n| Canada Rock (Billboard)[11] | 44 |\n| Czech Republic Rock (IFPI)[12] | 12 |\n| Japan Hot Overseas (Billboard)[13] | 19 |\n| New Zealand Hot Singles (RMNZ)[14] | 25 |\n| UK Singles Sales (OCC)[15] | 96 |\n| UK Singles Downloads (OCC)[16] | 93 |\n| UK Rock & Metal (OCC)[17] | 11 |\n| US Mainstream Rock (Billboard)[18] | 23 |\nReferences\nedit- ^ \"WOTP August 26th.

The first of two gigs that took place in 2024.\nInformation\nAnnounced on April 23rd, 2024, Muse performed at Abu Dhabi's Du Arena/Etihad Park, as part of the Yasalam F1 Post-Race Concerts, on December 8th, 2024. This was Muse's second time performing at the venue and at the event itself, with their first Yasalam post-race concert taking place in 2013.\nThe Show\nStaging-wise, the setup remained more or less the same as the festival production from the previous year but with some alterations; the burning \"WOTP\" sign was not present during the opening song, the flamethrowers were notably smaller than before, and the b-stage truss was much shorter. Will the Hacker was present however and was revealed during Compliance, the same way as during the arena shows of the Will of the People World Tour. Also notably, Matt used his Manson Chrome FR guitar for the majority of the show.\nWhile the length of the setlist echoed the previous festivals one, there were lots of changes to the order of the songs:\n- Simulation Theory Theme / JFK opened the show. The final line of the speech was edited (persumably by AI) to say \"Women will be what she was born to be\" instead of the original line. It was followed by Won't Stand Down which hadn't been played as the first song of a show since May 2022\n- Resistance, Madness, and Plug in Baby were all played earlier in the show than usual, while Will of the People was played later than usual.\n- Matt returned to playing the end of Compliance on guitar, something he's not done since January 2023.\n- Pressure was played for the first time since March 2023.\n- Hanging in Victory Square (from the Nineteen Eighty-Four score co-composed by Matt) was played live for the first time before Time is Running Out\n- Behold, The Glove was not played as an intro to Uprising for the first time since October 2022\n- The main set closed with Knights of Cydonia. Afterwards an unexpected encore was played consisting of Isolated System, Undisclosed Desires and Starlight. Matt wore his LED jacket during the whole encore, and confetti and streamers were released during the last chorus of Starlight.\nMedia\nYou can watch individual songs which were fan-recorded with the links below.\nSetlist\n- Simulation Theory Theme (shortened)\n/JFK + Won't Stand Down [watch]\n(Manson Oryx, satin graphite finish Status Stealth headless 5-string) - Interlude + Hysteria + Back in Black outro\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Resistance [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Drill Sergeant (robot voice) + Psycho\n(Manson Matt Black FR, woven chrome finish tricolor-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Kill or Be Killed (Felsmann + Tiley Reinterpretation)\n- Compliance (w/ guitar ending)\n(Manson Chrome FR, satin black Fender Jazz Bass) - Madness\n(Manson TronCaster, Status Kitara Doubleneck Bass Mk2) - Thought Contagion\n(Manson Chrome FR, satin black Fender Jazz Bass) - Pressure\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Plug In Baby (extended)\n(Manson Mirror, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Hanging in Victory Square [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Time Is Running Out [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Will of the People (extended) [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Supermassive Black Hole [watch]\n(Manson M1D1 Stealth, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Toccata and Fugue in D Minor intro + You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR 2.0, satin graphite finish Status Stealth headless 5-string) - Uprising (extended)\n(Manson Fire Red, woven chrome finish tricolor-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Man With a Harmonica + Knights of Cydonia [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass)Encore\n- Isolated System (shortened)\n- Undisclosed Desires [watch]\n(graphite finish Status The KingBass Mk-II) - Prelude + Starlight [watch]\n(graphite finish blue-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass)", "select_response": "<think>\nThe webpage provides detailed information about an upcoming concert by Muse at Abu Dhabi's Du Arena on December 8, 2024.

To access the pre-sale code, members account must've been createad prior to September 19th, 2022.\nMuse were supported by Evanescence and One Ok Rock.\nThe Show\nThe Setlist\n- The setlist overall remained somewhat similar to both the Mexican leg and the festival tour the previous year - but with numerous changes and additions.\n- Verona and Kill or Be Killed's Felsmann + Tiley remix both made their live debuts. The latter song was played from tape as an intro to Compliance early into the setlist, replacing The Gallery which was played previously.\n- The Dark Side's Alternate Reality Instrumental version was also played live for the first time, featuring Matt on slide guitar while sitting on Will the Hacker's shoulder.\n- Isolated System and Resistance were both played for the first time since 2018. The former song featured all new audio and news excerpts made to match the themes of the Will of the People album.\n- The Simulation Theory Theme also made its return for the first time since the end of the Simulation Theory World Tour. This time the speech was combined with JFK (marking the latter's first live appearance since 2016), and was used as an interstitial at the start of the encore before Kill or Be Killed.\n- The Cherub Rock riff was played in a similar fashion to the 2018 and 2019 Chicago gigs, as a tribute to Smashing Pumpkins. Also during the outro of Supermassive Black Hole, Matt played a sped up version of Limp Bizkit's 'Just Like This' riff.\nProduction and Staging\n- The staging and production again remained similar to a certain extent to previous legs, but was livened up a bit in various ways.\n- The stage was similar (but albiet simpler) to the Simulation Theory World Tour. It featured the usual square stage shape with a catwalk to a b-stage, which featured a sinking floor. The stage uniquely featured a transparent floor which allowed light rigs to be placed below the band (it's effect is best seen during We Are Fucking Fucked)\n- The stage featured the burning \"WOTP\" sign at the start as before, though following the end of Will of the People the curtain that covered the back of the stage was instead lowered manually rather than being dropped. Said curtain was also plain black rather than patterned.\n- As before, the band members all wore masks during Will of the People - additionally Dom also wore his during Isolated System and Matt wore his during Behold, The Glove.\n- The \"Will the Hacker\" inflatable was once again prominently featured, albeit it was instead revealed during the Kill or Be Killed Felsmann + Tiley remix, rather than during Won't Stand Down like previous shows. Will remained onstage until The Dark Side (Alternate Reality Instrumental), when the back of the stage was covered once again and remained covered until the end of the main set.\n- At the start of the encore, the curtain was lifted once again to reveal the new, second inflatable; a massive demon-like figure called \"Baph\". Baph is much taller than Will and additionally featured arms on each side of the stage and an ability to light-up its skeleton and eyes.\n- Fire cannons were once again prominently used throughout the show, though they were now placed behind the band and on each side of the stage, as opposed to being located along the front of the stage.\n- The stage also included six overhead LED light structures covered with mirrors, that were able to move up and down and form different shapes above the band during the second half of the show.

The show was short but a very good one! The singer, Ricky Wilson, is very charismatic and an excellent dancer!\nAbout Muse - Tour Simulation Theory:\nthe sound was very good, the instruments were heard in good frequency and also the voices.\nThe band has a strong connection on stage and a great dynamic between them.\nThe setlist was very well chosen, mixing successful songs from previous albums, like Hysteria, Supermassive and Starlight; and new album hits like: Algorithm, Propaganda and Thought Contagion.\nThe songs were similar to other shows that they played on this tour in all Latin America, but they surprised Santiago with the song Bliss (not in other setlists).\nLead singer Matt sings very well live can make different tones of voice, is incredible, just like the albums!\nIn addition, the lighting games and dancers who were on the stage during the show further contributed to the whole presentation.\nThe show finished with Knights of Cydonia and made everyone very happy!\nA great night! Thank you Muse!\nThis was the 3rd concert I have seen Muse at. I have to say as far as concerts go, you won't find one with any more to it than a Muse concert. I have been to many concerts and I love them all. Music made in a studio is never going to capture the real live sound. Music is made to be played live!\nThe Simulation tour was simply amazing. Visually, audibly and just being there. Having trombones being played, actually played not recorded and being a part of the opening was simply astonishing. It as a great sound and visually it was amazing. The same with Pressure, having the trombones out there added to the song and made it unbelievable.\nThey also played Dig Down the acoustic gospel version live. With Dom, Matt and Chris playing center of the stadium. Chris on the acoustic guitar, Matt on the piano and Dom obviously on the drums. What a neat set to see them playing so close together and the gospel signers on stage lit up by their costumes. Very well done!\nOur son didn't(teenager) didn't understand the Close Encounters of the 3rd kind part. Where Matt was playing the guitar and the mother ship was responding. He is too young. :-) My wife and I got it.\nWatching Matt play his guitar by his tong! What? I had never seen anything like it. He is amazing. Chris is just amazing on bass and Dom on drums. These guys can do it all!\nWhat a fun show. I really appreciate what Muse has done to give back to their fan's. Too many bands don't care as long as they sell their tickets. Muse doesn't appear to be like that. Even purchasing tickets, they allow the true fans to purchase first getting the best seats.\nI look forward to seeing them again! Great show, great music, and a great time. Playing for almost 2 hours. Great job Muse!\nThere is a reason these guys play in big arenas. It’s not just a few guys on a stage playing their music, it’s a production. Even up in the nosebleeds it was a great show.\nSpoiler alert! Don’t read any further if you don’t want to know.\nHad it all! Glowing glasses, lit up suits, giant robots, a piano that shoots lasers, dancers with flashlights, smoke machines and glowing batons, and a special appearance by Eddie! People hanging from wires, surprises coming up from trap doors, lasers, lasers and more lasers! The set was a blistering 26 songs lasting a little over two hours!\nI will definitely see them again the next time they come to town. Though not from the balcony. They say “Don’t look down if you have a thing about heights.” That’s where the stage is!\nGreat show.", "select_response": "<think>\nThe purpose of this search round is to gather recent information about a music artist, including new singles, music videos, collaborations, interviews, future projects, and tours for the years 2024-2025.

Muse is known for a unique style of alt-rock, with electronic music leanings and a blend of classical music, which lends to an ethereal, melancholic sound.\nStarting in the early ’90s under the original name Gothic Plague, the band toured relentlessly with bands such as Skunk Anansie. The band released its first EPs to a loyal fan base and was met with relative success in the UK indie charts. This earned the group crucial backing from the likes of Steve Lamacq and NME, and its debut studio album Showbiz was released in 1999, scoring relative chart success. The album has since gone on to become a certified platinum album in the UK.\nMuse’s second album, released in 2001, revealed a growth in sound and ambition that is still evident in its records today. Origin of Symmetry saw the band shift into progressive rock territory, producing momentous singles like “New Born” and “Bliss.” The album acted as a catalyst that moved Muse into commercial and critical success for years to come. Its next four albums all topped the UK album charts, and the band has sold over 15 million albums worldwide.\nIn 2003, Muse released its third album, Absolution. This album debuted at number one in the UK, and with time, became certified gold in the US. This album is widely considered the band’s breakthrough album, with key hits such as “Time Is Running Out” and “Hysteria” topping the charts. In support of this album, Muse headed out on a year-long international tour.\nIn 2006, Muse released its fourth studio album, Black Holes and Revelations. This album debuted at number one on the charts in five countries. From this album, two singles, \"Supermassive Black Hole\" and \"Knights of Cydonia,\" became chart-toppers, reaching the top 10 hits in the UK.\nMuse’s live shows also followed the same ambitious, gargantuan elevation of music. Famed for its tours, the band has won two Brit Awards for Best Live Act, and it sells out arenas and stadiums around the globe with ease. Muse has become a legendary force on the festival circuit, and has headlined Reading and Leeds, T in the Park, and Glastonbury over the years. At Glastonbury Festival 2010, a gigantic crowd to its pyramid stage set up at the latter event in 2010.\nAround the same time, Muse’s latest album The Resistance was conquering all corners of the UK. The band then scooped three Grammy nominations and a win for Best Rock Album, which helped it officially break into the US. Its explosion in popularity led to its performance at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London – and to its single “Survival” becoming the official anthem of the event.\nSince its acclaimed Olympic performance, Muse has gone on to produce three more albums. Released in 2015, Drones was an album that aimed to return to the original rock sound for which Muse was originally known, but weaved in a powerful statement on the dehumanization of modern warfare. with the release of Drones, Muse began another tour focused on small venues throughout the UK and theAlong US. Drones an immediate hit, topping charts globally.\nAfter touring the globe, including headlining at major festivals, Muse continued its path forward with another album release in 2018 — Simulation Theory. This kicked off the Simulation Theory World Tour, which took the band all the way from Houston, Texas, to a final stop in Lima, Peru.\nAt the end of 2019, Muse released a special compilation box titled Origin of Muse. This included remastered versions of its albums and previously unreleased music. This special edition is a dream come true for Muse fans. The box contains a 48-page book, nine CDs, four vinyl records. One of the highlights of the set is a fully-remastered version of the band’s debut album Showbiz.\nMost recently, in 2022, Muse released the Will of the People. This album showcases the darker, heavier side of Muse’s music, with singles “Won’t Stand Down” and “Compliance” quickly becoming fan favorites.\nKnown for its flawless performances, Muse continues to capture the depth of its musical history in every show. Fans, who are often referred to as Musers, flock to see the band perform at large arenas around the world. Most shows sell out, and in order to find a position near the front of the stage, Musers arrive hours ahead of showtime.\nNot only does Muse deliver an incredibly dynamic and energetic live show, but its sound production is renowned for being top-quality. Bellamy’s vocals can be heard clearly, along with every accompanying instrument. Recently, touring member Morgan Nicholls was replaced by Dan Lancaster. Lancaster now plays additional keys, percussion, and guitar, as well as providing backup vocals.\nTo snag tickets to a Muse tour date, make sure to pay attention to recently released tour schedules. Muse’s 2022-2023 “The Will of the People World” Tour reaches far and wide.\nRead moreEnjoyed the band but not the show. The organizers failed in everything they could fail. Believe me, I've been to a lot of international shows here in Argentina and Chile, and this was the first time ever that I couldn't hear the music some times.\nThe \"Complejo al Río\" is in a great zone of Vicente López, really near to buses, subway, and two of the most important avenues (Av. Santa Fe/Cabildo/Maipú and Av. Libertador); so I got there without any troubles and even had some food because there were a lot of places to eat or drink near it.\nIt all went down when the showtime was getting near: I got in without getting checked, as most people, really dangerous; then, the entrance was full of construction debris (dangerous x2). Once I was in, I realized that the venue was pretty much a cement parking lot with a couple of bleachers, wouldn't be much of a problem if it weren't that: a) there were holes in the floor, so somebody could have get hurt while jumping and; b) it was on downhill, so that meant that in certain areas of the \"campo trasero\" you couldn't see anything.\nWhen it started, everyone was excited, jumping, but two songs in we realised that we couldn't hear sometimes: the sound came and then go away. You could literally heard people talking over the music! And this wasn't an acoustic show! The low-volume stayed the whole gig, and it ruined songs like Madness that I could literally not hear. Bonus track: Matt confused Argentina with Uruguay and used their flag here. Everyone shouting \"NOOO\" which meant hearing even less.\nGoing strictly to the show: the band pulled out a pretty good one, they didn't interacted with the public a lot but considering videos I've seen, that's just how they are. The setlist was the very same of two days ago in Chile, so there's nothing to complain about though we Argentinians are used to the fact that the bands always play more songs here, or change the setlist a bit. Muse was not the case.\nI still had a great time and would totally go to see this band again, specially because I feel like I didn't got the full experience. It's too much to know that they never come with the full stages and theatrics to add the fact that they came without speakers.\nThis was the 3rd concert I have seen Muse at. I have to say as far as concerts go, you won't find one with any more to it than a Muse concert. I have been to many concerts and I love them all. Music made in a studio is never going to capture the real live sound. Music is made to be played live!\nThe Simulation tour was simply amazing. Visually, audibly and just being there. Having trombones being played, actually played not recorded and being a part of the opening was simply astonishing. It as a great sound and visually it was amazing. The same with Pressure, having the trombones out there added to the song and made it unbelievable.\nThey also played Dig Down the acoustic gospel version live. With Dom, Matt and Chris playing center of the stadium. Chris on the acoustic guitar, Matt on the piano and Dom obviously on the drums. What a neat set to see them playing so close together and the gospel signers on stage lit up by their costumes. Very well done!\nOur son didn't(teenager) didn't understand the Close Encounters of the 3rd kind part. Where Matt was playing the guitar and the mother ship was responding. He is too young. :-) My wife and I got it.\nWatching Matt play his guitar by his tong! What? I had never seen anything like it. He is amazing. Chris is just amazing on bass and Dom on drums. These guys can do it all!\nWhat a fun show. I really appreciate what Muse has done to give back to their fan's. Too many bands don't care as long as they sell their tickets. Muse doesn't appear to be like that. Even purchasing tickets, they allow the true fans to purchase first getting the best seats.\nI look forward to seeing them again! Great show, great music, and a great time. Playing for almost 2 hours. Great job Muse!\nOver the course of two decades, Muse’s live show has evolved into one of the most sensational spectacles in the world - an experience worthy of four (!) live DVDs churned out since the release of Hullabaloo in 2001.\nFrom humble beginnings touring the UK dive bar circuit, the band’s intellectual prog-rock quickly earned them the heavy burden of ‘the next Radiohead’: a stigma brushed aside, and a prophecy fulfilled.\nThe band’s trajectory to international stardom was driven in the early noughties by huge success around ‘Origin Of Symmetry’ and ‘Absolution’; a pair of records that delivered sold out arena shows across the globe.\nFrom that point on, Muse poured everything into their live show. From huge satellite dishes beaming light into the sky to monumental, rotating pillars, each tour delivers something totally unexpected, and utterly jawdropping. And that’s prior to any mention of the crazy, crazy talent exhibited on stage. Matt Bellamy, one of the few true rockstars of the modern age, thrashes and strokes at his guitar in equal measure, and delivers stunning falsetto vocals. Though the band have recruited extra, ‘behind-the-scenes’ members over recent years, the amount of noise produced by the three piece remains astounding.\nWith Glastonbury and Coachella headline slots - and just about everything other accolade - under their belts, where now for Muse? Somehow, the only way, still, is up. And it’s guaranteed to be totally bombastic.\nSince their incarnation in 1994, the Devon trio has evolved from a garage rock band into a momentous live act that has conquered the largest stages and festivals all around the planet with their space-themed apoco-pop rock. The band has six albums in its discography, which was not seem like very much for an artist that has reached a reputation as saintly as Muse, yet it is what Matt Bellamy and co transform their music into onstage which continues to wow audiences.\nAs the bass rumbles and begins 'Supremacy', the band appear all at once surrounded by fire and pyrotechnics as they wage some solar war all within their own minds. As they run through their hits such as 'Supermassive Black Hole' and 'Starlight' at blistering speeds, the audience have no choice to watch on in blind amazement. Matt Bellamy is a frontman often likened to the late, great Freddie Mercury and after seeing him perform you realise there is serious weight behind these lofty claims.\nNo matter how big his crowd, Matt throws himself into every blistering guitar solo and whips crowds into frenzies like no other. When the finale of 'Knights Of Cydonia' kicks in, the audience has completely surrendered itself to the supernatural, surreal world of Muse and simply hope they will never return.\nSantiago de Chile - October 13th\nThe first good surprise was with the opening band, Kaiser Chiefs. The show was short but a very good one! The singer, Ricky Wilson, is very charismatic and an excellent dancer!\nAbout Muse - Tour Simulation Theory:\nthe sound was very good, the instruments were heard in good frequency and also the voices.\nThe band has a strong connection on stage and a great dynamic between them.\nThe setlist was very well chosen, mixing successful songs from previous albums, like Hysteria, Supermassive and Starlight; and new album hits like: Algorithm, Propaganda and Thought Contagion.\nThe songs were similar to other shows that they played on this tour in all Latin America, but they surprised Santiago with the song Bliss (not in other setlists).\nLead singer Matt sings very well live can make different tones of voice, is incredible, just like the albums!\nIn addition, the lighting games and dancers who were on the stage during the show further contributed to the whole presentation.\nThe show finished with Knights of Cydonia and made everyone very happy!\nA great night! Thank you Muse!\nI had seen Muse a few times at various festivals over the years (Reading twice, V Festival, Download) and wanted to see them in their own show and I thought what better place than to do that than at Londons O2 Arena.\nMuse played for 2 hours with a faultless performance. Belting out classics such as Plug In Baby, Stockholm Syndrome and completing the evening with the infectious Knights Of Cydonia as well as promoting songs from the current Drones album.\nMy only regret of the evening was having to be upstairs on Level 4 for this concert. People standing in the Floor areas and Level 1 seem to be able to let loose and enjoy themselves but upstairs really didn't know how to behave at a rock concert with he majority remaining seated and I was even asked to sit down by the person behind me. Unfortunately the big arenas can bring out the punters who aren't used to what a rock concert can be about but i'll balance this comment by saying that I should have been downstairs if I really wanted to rock out.\nGreat performance by band, disappointed with the crowd as a whole.\nWe came in from Houston to see Muse in Austin. I've had to miss their TX shows in the past because I didnt have the money or time, but this year I said fuck it, I'm going to this show and I wont miss them again. It was so worth it. They sounded amazing, the whole band are great performers. They posted the whole concert on facebook so I thought that was cool. I can watch it again if I want. So, so worth it. The stage was really cool with these stacks of video monitors in the back and they were staggered. It's hard to describe, but it looked really good. The only complaint I had was that I bought an actual seat but everyone stood the whole time, so it was kind of pointless, but I'm glad I had something to lean on if I got too tired. It was kind of hard to see the band on stage because people were in the way, but I'm sort of short so...oh well. It was a very minor complaint and nothing against Muse. If (I should say WHEN) I see them again, I'll try to get a seat on the rail with no one in front of me, but you know how it goes.\nAn impressive start with \"Psycho\" brought all the energy to the Olympia-halle without any warming up. The setlist was loaded with the tracks of their latest Best-Rock-Album-Grammy winner, \"Drones\", but also included some classics as \"Plug In Baby\", \"Stockholm Syndrome\", and an amazing performance of \"Citizen Erased\", a song from \"Origin of Symmetry\" rarely played in the latest years shows.\nThe stage in itself deserves recognition as it was meant to rotate, while holding a structure from where around ten drones came into the show flashing and wandering around some meters over the crowd. In addition, a series of interactive projections were prepared in accordance to every song lyrics.\nBellamy asked people to help on singing the already classic \"Time Is Running Out\", as well as \"Starlight\" and the whole chorus for \"Uprising\".\nA great show that clarifies why they are one of the best live bands at the moment.\nThere is a reason these guys play in big arenas. It’s not just a few guys on a stage playing their music, it’s a production. Even up in the nosebleeds it was a great show.\nSpoiler alert! Don’t read any further if you don’t want to know.\nHad it all! Glowing glasses, lit up suits, giant robots, a piano that shoots lasers, dancers with flashlights, smoke machines and glowing batons, and a special appearance by Eddie! People hanging from wires, surprises coming up from trap doors, lasers, lasers and more lasers! The set was a blistering 26 songs lasting a little over two hours!\nI will definitely see them again the next time they come to town. Though not from the balcony. They say “Don’t look down if you have a thing about heights.” That’s where the stage is!\nGreat show.\nSaw them in Milan 20/5. I've been attending concerts for more than 10 years now and this gig goes into my top 5!! The show, the energy, the sound (!!) was amazing! I was blown away by Matt's voice, so clear and beautiful, Chris's dexterity with the bass (for me the second best bass player ever) and Dominic's drum solos. I loved the round stage in the center of the arena, you can really see them well from wherever you are standing/seating. I really wish more bands could afford this kind of technology, oh well... And the video projections, especially the puppeteering part during The Handler... genious and scary! The setlist included almost all the songs I wanted to hear live (I only missed Stockholm Syndrome and Bliss). All in all, kudos to the guys, really, I hope too see them again very soon.\nWant to see Muse in concert?

That’s the last thing we want.\n“And also we don’t want a total communist situation on the hard left either. I think what we want is something completely new. I don’t think it exists out there at the moment, but I think there’s a new type of politics that could emerge,” he added. “I would call it Meta-Centrism.
