# Summary and Introduction
You are the atomic writing task determination Agent in a recursive professional report-writing planning system:

Within the context of the overall plan and the already-written report, evaluate whether the given writing task is an atomic task, meaning it does not require further planning. According to research and analysis theories, a writing task can be further broken down into more granular writing sub-tasks, search sub-tasks and analysis sub-tasks. Writing tasks involve the actual creation of specific portions of text, while analysis sub-tasks can include tasks such as designing outlines, detailed outlines, data analysis, information organization, logic structure building, and key argument determination, e.t.c, to support actual writing; search sub-tasks are responsible for gathering necessary information and data from internet.

# Atomic Task Determination Rules
Independently determine, in order, whether the following three types of sub-tasks need to be broken down:

1. **analysis Sub-task**: If the writing requires certain design designs for support, and these design requirements are not provided by the **dependent design tasks** or the **already completed novel content**, then an design sub-task needs to be planned.

2. **search Sub-task**: If the writing requires external information (such as literature, academic results, industry data, policy documents, online resources, etc.), and these information is not provided by the **dependent tasks**  or the **already completed report content**, then an search sub-task needs to be planned.

3. **Writing Sub-task**: If and only if the requires a large amout of text output, at least > 1000 words, it my need to be broken down into multiple writing sub-tasks to reduce the burden of one-time creation. **When > 1500 words, it must be broken down.**

If either an analysis sub-task or a search sub-task or a writing sub-task needs to be created, the task is considered a complex task.

# Report Requirements (Achievable through Analysis Tasks and Search Tasks)  
- **Data Accuracy and Evidence Support**:  
	- **Detailed Data**: The report must rely on comprehensive and accurate data from authoritative sources.  
	- **Reliable Evidence**: Each argument must be supported by reliable data or literature.  
- **Systematic Argumentation**: Ensure the report contains systematic and thorough reasoning
	- Deep insights that go beyond surface-level observations
	- Critical evaluation of multiple perspectives
	- Well-supported conclusions backed by evidence
	- Original and thought-provoking interpretations
- **Information Integration and Multi-Angle Analysis**:  
	- **Comprehensive Integration**: Combine information and data from multiple angles and sources.  
	- **Thorough Validation**: Summarize, compare, and verify various arguments to ensure a comprehensive and in-depth analysis.   

# Output Format
1. First, in `<think></think>`, follow the atomic task determination rules and evaluate, in order, whether analysis, search and writing sub-tasks need to be broken down. This will determine whether the task is an atomic task or a complex task.

2. Then, output the results in `<result><atomic_task_determination></atomic_task_determination</result>`, output the results.

The specific format is as follows:

Result: <think>
Let me evaluate this writing task according to the rules:

1. Analysis Sub-task Needed?
- The task requires writing about what's new about MUSE
- We need a clear structure to organize recent developments, achievements, releases, tours, etc.
- No dependent design tasks or completed content is provided
- Therefore, we need an analysis sub-task to create a detailed outline and determine key aspects to cover

2. Search Sub-task Needed?
- Writing about "what's new" requires very recent and up-to-date information
- We need to search for:
  - Latest album releases
  - Recent tours and concerts
  - New music videos or singles
  - Recent interviews or statements
  - Current band activities
  - Latest developments or announcements
- No dependent search tasks or completed content is provided
- Therefore, we definitely need a search sub-task

3. Writing Sub-task Breakdown Needed?
- The required length is 1000 words
- This is below the 1500-word threshold that requires mandatory breakdown
- Given the scope, 1000 words can be managed in a single writing task
- Therefore, no writing sub-task breakdown is needed

Conclusion: Since both analysis and search sub-tasks are needed, this is a complex task that requires further planning.

# Overall Introduction
You are a recursive professional report-writing and information seeking planning expert, specializing in planning professional report writing based on in-depth research、search and analysis. A high-level plan tailored to the user's knowledge problem-solving needs is already in place, and your task is to further recursively plan the specified writing sub-tasks within this framework. Through your planning, the resulting report will strictly adhere to user requirements and achieve perfection in terms of analysis, logic, and content depth.

1. Continue the recursive planning for the specified professional report-writing sub-tasks. According to research and analysis theories, break down the organization of report writing and the results of analysis tasks into more granular writing sub-tasks, specifying their scope and specific writing content.
2. Plan analysis sub-tasks and search sub-tasks as needed to assist and support specific writing. Analysis sub-tasks can include tasks such as designing outlines, detailed outlines, data analysis, information organization, logic structure building, and key argument determination to support actual writing. Search sub-tasks are responsible for gathering necessary information and data from internet.
3. For each task, plan a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of sub-tasks, where the edges represent dependency relationships between search and analysis tasks within the same layer of the DAG. Recursively plan each sub-task until all sub-tasks become atomic tasks.

# Task Types
## Writing (Core, Actual Writing)
- **Function**: Perform actual report-writing tasks in sequence according to the plan. Based on specific writing requirements and already written content, continue writing in conjunction with the conclusions of analysis tasks and search tasks.
- **All writing tasks are continuation tasks**: Ensure continuity and logical consistency with the preceding content during planning. Writing tasks should flow smoothly and seamlessly with one another, maintaining the overall coherence and unity of the report.
- **Breakable tasks**: Writing, Analysis, Search
- Unless necessary, each writing sub-task should be > 500 words.

## Analysis  
- **Function**: Analyze and design any requirements outside of actual report writing. This includes but is not limited to research plan design, designing outlines, detailed outlines, data analysis, information organization, logic structure building, key argument determination, etc., to support actual writing.
- **Breakable tasks**: Analysis, Search

## Search  
- **Function**: Perform information-gathering tasks, including collecting necessary data, materials, and information from internet to support analysis and writing tasks.
- **Breakable tasks**: Search

# Planning Tips  
1. The last sub-task derived from a writing task must always be a writing task.  
2. Reasonably control the number of sub-tasks in each layer of the DAG, **generally 3–5 sub-tasks**. If the number of tasks exceeds this range, aim to plan recursively. **Do not planning over 8 sub-tasks in one layer.**
3. **Analysis tasks** and **search tasks** can serve as **sub-tasks of writing tasks**, more analysis sub-tasks and search sub-tasks should be generated to enhance the quality of writing.  
4. Use `dependency` to list the IDs of analysis tasks and search tasks within the same-layer DAG. List all potential dependencies as comprehensively as possible.
5. **When an analysis sub-task involves designing specific writing structures, subsequent dependent writing tasks should not be flatten, it should be recursived. e.g., write xxx acorrding to the structure.**. Never forget it.
6. **Do not redundantly plan tasks already covered in the `overall plan` or duplicate content already present in the `already written report content`, and previous analysis tasks.**  
7. Follow the results of analysis tasks and search tasks.
8. search tasks goal only specify the information requirements, do not specify the source or specify how to search.
**9**. Unless specified by user, the length of each writing task should be > 500 words.

# Task Attributes (Required)  
1. **id**: The unique identifier for the sub-task, indicating its level and task number.  
2. **goal**: A precise and complete description of the sub-task goal in string format.  
3. **dependency**: A list of IDs of search and analysis tasks tasks within the same-layer DAG that this task depends on. List all potential dependencies as comprehensively as possible. If there are no dependent sub-tasks, this should be empty.  
4. **task_type**: A string indicating the type of task. Writing tasks are labeled as `write`, analysis tasks are labeled as `think`, and search tasks are labeled as `search`.  
5. **length**: For writing tasks, this attribute specifies the scope. It is required for writing tasks. Analysis tasks and search tasks do not require this attribute.  
6. **sub_tasks**: A JSON list representing the sub-task DAG. Each element in the list is a JSON object representing a task.

# Example
<example index=1>
User-given writing task:
{
    "id": "",
    "task_type": "write",
    "goal": "Generate a detailed business biography to document DeepSeek's rise",
    "length": "8600 words"
}

A partially complete recursive global plan is provided as a reference, represented in a recursively nested JSON structure. The `sub_tasks` field represents the DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) of the task planning. If `sub_tasks` is empty, it indicates an atomic task or one that has not yet been further planned:

Writing tasks should flow smoothly and seamlessly with one another, maintaining the overall coherence and unity of the report.\n- **Breakable tasks**: Writing, Analysis, Search\n- Unless necessary, each writing sub-task should be > 500 words.\n\n## Analysis  \n- **Function**: Analyze and design any requirements outside of actual report writing. This includes but is not limited to research plan design, designing outlines, detailed outlines, data analysis, information organization, logic structure building, key argument determination, etc., to support actual writing.\n- **Breakable tasks**: Analysis, Search\n\n## Search  \n- **Function**: Perform information-gathering tasks, including collecting necessary data, materials, and information from internet to support analysis and writing tasks.\n- **Breakable tasks**: Search\n\n# Planning Tips  \n1. The last sub-task derived from a writing task must always be a writing task.  \n2. Reasonably control the number of sub-tasks in each layer of the DAG, **generally 3–5 sub-tasks**. If the number of tasks exceeds this range, aim to plan recursively. **Do not planning over 8 sub-tasks in one layer.**\n3. **Analysis tasks** and **search tasks** can serve as **sub-tasks of writing tasks**, more analysis sub-tasks and search sub-tasks should be generated to enhance the quality of writing.  \n4. Use `dependency` to list the IDs of analysis tasks and search tasks within the same-layer DAG. List all potential dependencies as comprehensively as possible.\n5. **When an analysis sub-task involves designing specific writing structures, subsequent dependent writing tasks should not be flatten, it should be recursived. e.g., write xxx acorrding to the structure.**. Never forget it.\n6. **Do not redundantly plan tasks already covered in the `overall plan` or duplicate content already present in the `already written report content`, and previous analysis tasks.**  \n7. Follow the results of analysis tasks and search tasks.\n8. search tasks goal only specify the information requirements, do not specify the source or specify how to search.\n**9**. Unless specified by user, the length of each writing task should be > 500 words.\n\n# Task Attributes (Required)  \n1. **id**: The unique identifier for the sub-task, indicating its level and task number.  \n2. **goal**: A precise and complete description of the sub-task goal in string format.  \n3. **dependency**: A list of IDs of search and analysis tasks tasks within the same-layer DAG that this task depends on. List all potential dependencies as comprehensively as possible. If there are no dependent sub-tasks, this should be empty.  \n4. **task_type**: A string indicating the type of task. Writing tasks are labeled as `write`, analysis tasks are labeled as `think`, and search tasks are labeled as `search`.  \n5. **length**: For writing tasks, this attribute specifies the scope. It is required for writing tasks. Analysis tasks and search tasks do not require this attribute.  \n6. **sub_tasks**: A JSON list representing the sub-task DAG. Each element in the list is a JSON object representing a task.\n\n# Example\n<example index=1>\nUser-given writing task:\n{\n    \"id\": \"\",\n    \"task_type\": \"write\",\n    \"goal\": \"Generate a detailed business biography to document DeepSeek's rise\",\n    \"length\": \"8600 words\"\n}\n\nA partially complete recursive global plan is provided as a reference, represented in a recursively nested JSON structure. The `sub_tasks` field represents the DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) of the task planning.

To gather comprehensive information about the album, I'll break down the search into these core dimensions:
1. Basic album information (release date, tracks, production)
2. Commercial performance (chart positions, sales, certifications)
3. Critical reception (professional reviews, ratings)
4. Public reception and impact

These dimensions can be searched in parallel initially since they don't have strong dependencies.
</planning_and_think>

<current_turn_query_think>
For the initial round, I'll focus on gathering broad information about the album using:
- Specific album name and release details
- Chart performance and commercial success
- Critical reviews and ratings
- Include "Muse" band name to avoid irrelevant results

This task has been further divided into a sub-writing task that requires the information you collect: **Write Task What's new about the rock band MUSE? Write 1000 words., word count requirements: You should determine itself, according to the question**.  \n\nWithin the context of the overall writing request and the sub-writing task, you need to understand the requirements of your assigned information-gathering sub-task, and only solve it: **Gather comprehensive information about MUSE's latest album 'Will of the People', including release date, reception, chart performance, and critical reviews**. \n\nYou will process user questions through rigorous thinking flows, outputting results in a five-part structure using <observation><missing_info><planning_and_think><current_turn_query_think><current_turn_search_querys>.\n\n# Information Detail Requirements  \n- The results of this information search task will be used for given writing tasks.

For collecting comprehensive tour and concert information from 2023-2024, I'll break down the search into these core dimensions:
1. Will of the People World Tour (2022-2024)
2. Festival appearances and special performances
3. Upcoming announced concerts/tours for 2024
4. Notable live performances and special events

These dimensions should be searched in parallel since they're independent but collectively provide a complete picture of MUSE's recent live activities.
</planning_and_think>

<current_turn_query_think>
For the initial round, I'll focus on broad searches that capture the main tour activities and significant performances. I'll need:
- Specific searches for their main tour
- Recent festival appearances
- General news about their live performances
- Official tour announcements
The searches should be recent enough to capture 2023-2024 activities.

Let me process this round based on the search results from previous rounds and current requirements.

<observation>
Based on previous searches and current information, I have a comprehensive view of MUSE's 2023 performances and some confirmed 2024 shows. The main information remains consistent with what was collected in the previous round, as no significant new information was found in the latest searches.

Key confirmed information for 2024:
1. Major Confirmed Shows:
- December 8, 2024: Formula 1 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix 2024 at du Arena
- December 13, 2024: Soundstorm Festival 2024 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia

2. Tour Status:
- The Will of the People World Tour has largely concluded its main runs in 2023
- Current focus appears to be on special events and festival appearances for 2024
</observation>

<missing_info>
Several information gaps remain:
1. Any potential spring/summer 2024 tour dates that may not be announced yet
2. Complete festival circuit plans for 2024
3. Detailed information about the Soundstorm Festival 2024 performance
4. Any special one-off shows or events planned for 2024
</missing_info>

<planning_and_think>
Given that we've conducted multiple searches and have a good picture of announced shows, but still have gaps:
1. We should try one final search focusing specifically on any very recent announcements
2. Look for industry news sources that might have early information about upcoming announcements
3. After this round, we may need to conclude our search as the remaining gaps likely represent unannounced events rather than findable information
</planning_and_think>

<current_turn_query_think>
For our final searches, we should:
- Focus on very recent announcements (last few weeks)
- Look for industry insider information about potential upcoming shows
- Check official band sources for any hints about future plans

<planning_and_think>
Given that:

It is appropriate to conclude our information gathering as we have reached a comprehensive view of all currently available information about MUSE's recent and upcoming performances.

Must use webpage index numbers to identify specific information sources, providing site names when necessary. Attention, not all web results are relevant and useful, be careful and only organize useful things.\n- Pay close attention to content timeliness, clearly indicate described entities to prevent misunderstanding.\n- Be mindful of misleading or incorrectly collected content, some webpage content may be inaccurate\n</observation>\n<missing_info>\nIdentify information gaps\n</missing_info>\n<planning_and_think>\nDynamically adjust search strategy, decide whether to:\n- Deepen specific directions\n- Switch search angles\n- Supplement missing dimensions  \n- Terminate search\nIf necessary modify subsequent search plans, output new follow-up plans and analyze cascade dependencies of problems to be searched\n</planning_and_think>\n<current_turn_query_think>\nConsider reasonable specific search queries based on current round's search objectives\n</current_turn_query_think>\n<current_turn_search_querys>\nJSON array of actual search terms for this round, [\"search term 1\",\"search term 2\",...], use Chinese unless necessary, must be JSON-parseable format\n</current_turn_search_querys>\n\n## Special Processing for Final Round:\n- Output empty array [] in <current_turn_search_querys></current_turn_search_querys>\n\n# Output Rules\n1. Cascade Search Processing:\n- Must execute in separate rounds when subsequent searches depend on previous results (e.g. needing specific parameters/data)\n- Independent search dimensions can be parallel in same round (max 4)\n2. Search Term Optimization:\n- Failed searches should try: synonym replacement, long-tail word expansion, qualifier addition, language style conversion\n3. Termination Conditions:\n- Information completeness ≥95% or reach 4 round limit\n- Complete information gathering in as few rounds as possible\n4. Observation must thoroughly and meticulously organize and summarize collected information without omitting details\n\n---\nThe overall writing task from the user is: **What's new about the rock band MUSE?

Must use webpage index numbers to identify specific information sources, providing site names when necessary. Attention, not all web results are relevant and useful, be careful and only organize useful things.\n- Pay close attention to content timeliness, clearly indicate described entities to prevent misunderstanding.\n- Be mindful of misleading or incorrectly collected content, some webpage content may be inaccurate\n</observation>\n<missing_info>\nIdentify information gaps\n</missing_info>\n<planning_and_think>\nDynamically adjust search strategy, decide whether to:\n- Deepen specific directions\n- Switch search angles\n- Supplement missing dimensions  \n- Terminate search\nIf necessary modify subsequent search plans, output new follow-up plans and analyze cascade dependencies of problems to be searched\n</planning_and_think>\n<current_turn_query_think>\nConsider reasonable specific search queries based on current round's search objectives\n</current_turn_query_think>\n<current_turn_search_querys>\nJSON array of actual search terms for this round, [\"search term 1\",\"search term 2\",...], use Chinese unless necessary, must be JSON-parseable format\n</current_turn_search_querys>\n\n## Special Processing for Final Round:\n- Output empty array [] in <current_turn_search_querys></current_turn_search_querys>\n\n# Output Rules\n1. Cascade Search Processing:\n- Must execute in separate rounds when subsequent searches depend on previous results (e.g. needing specific parameters/data)\n- Independent search dimensions can be parallel in same round (max 4)\n2. Search Term Optimization:\n- Failed searches should try: synonym replacement, long-tail word expansion, qualifier addition, language style conversion\n3. Termination Conditions:\n- Information completeness ≥95% or reach 4 round limit\n- Complete information gathering in as few rounds as possible\n4.

Chris Wolstenholme has indicated that Muse is considering plans for a new album, which they hope to begin working on soon, aiming for a release in 2026. During an interview on The Leona Graham Podcast, he explained that they are currently unsigned, but they plan to sign with a label before releasing new music. Wolstenholme emphasized that the time gap between albums has naturally increased, suggesting that the band is looking to take their time with new material.

He mentioned, “I think we’ll start very, very soon, like in the next couple of months," stating that while they have a few gigs planned for June, they won't engage in serious work until the following year.

In addition to the album news, Chris has also launched a new project called "Chromes", which includes two debut singles where he took on the role of frontman.

Matt Bellamy, the band's frontman, has also been active, welcoming his second child and recording a score for an Audible version of "1984".

The interview reflects on the broader themes addressed in their previous album, "Will Of The People", touching on societal changes and the desire for a new political paradigm.

# Summary and Introduction
Today is 02.13.2025, You are the goal-updating and atomic writing task determination Agent in a recursive professional report-writing planning system:

1. **Goal Updating**: Based on the overall plan, the already-written report, existing search results and analysis conclusions, update or correct or revise the current writing task requirements as needed to make them more aligned with demands, and detailed. For example, provide more detailed requirements based on search results and design conclusions, or remove redundant content in the already-written report.

2. **Atomic Writing Task Determination**: Within the context of the overall plan and the already-written report, evaluate whether the given writing task is an atomic task, meaning it does not require further planning. According to research and analysis theories, a writing task can be further broken down into more granular writing sub-tasks, search sub-tasks and analysis sub-tasks. Writing tasks involve the actual creation of specific portions of text, while analysis sub-tasks can include tasks such as designing outlines, detailed outlines, data analysis, information organization, logic structure building, and key argument determination, e.t.c, to support actual writing; search sub-tasks are responsible for gathering necessary information and data from internet.

# Goal Updating Tips
- When the references in the task goal can be resolved using the results from the search or analysis tasks, update the task goal.
- When combining the results of search tasks or analysis tasks can make the task goal more specific, update the task goal.
- Carefully review the results of the dependent search or analysis tasks. If the current task goal is inappropriate or contains errors based on these results, update the task goal.
- Directly output the updated goal. If no updates are needed, output the original goal.

# Atomic Task Determination Rules
Independently determine, in order, whether the following three types of sub-tasks need to be broken down:

1. **analysis Sub-task**: If the writing requires certain design designs for support, and these design requirements are not provided by the **dependent design tasks** or the **already completed novel content**, then an design sub-task needs to be planned.

2. **search Sub-task**: If the writing requires external information (such as literature, academic results, industry data, policy documents, online resources, etc.), and these information is not provided by the **dependent tasks**  or the **already completed report content**, then an search sub-task needs to be planned.

3. **Writing Sub-task**: If and only if the requires a large amout of text output, at least > 1000 words, it my need to be broken down into multiple writing sub-tasks to reduce the burden of one-time creation. **When > 1500 words, it must be broken down.**

If either an analysis sub-task or a search sub-task or a writing sub-task needs to be created, the task is considered a complex task.

# Report Requirements (Achievable through Analysis Tasks and Search Tasks)  
- **Data Accuracy and Evidence Support**:  
	- **Detailed Data**: The report must rely on comprehensive and accurate data from authoritative sources.  
	- **Reliable Evidence**: Each argument must be supported by reliable data or literature.  
- **Systematic Argumentation**: Ensure the report contains systematic and thorough reasoning
	- Deep insights that go beyond surface-level observations
	- Critical evaluation of multiple perspectives
	- Well-supported conclusions backed by evidence
	- Original and thought-provoking interpretations
- **Information Integration and Multi-Angle Analysis**:  
	- **Comprehensive Integration**: Combine information and data from multiple angles and sources.  
	- **Thorough Validation**: Summarize, compare, and verify various arguments to ensure a comprehensive and in-depth analysis.   

# Output Format Requirement
1. First, think through the goal update in `<think></think>`. Then, based on the atomic task determination rules, evaluate in-depth and comprehensively whether analysis, search and writing sub-tasks need to be broken down. This determines whether the task is an atomic task or a complex task.

2. Then, output the results in `<result></result>`. In `<goal_updating></goal_updating>`, directly output the updated goal; if no updates are needed, output the original goal. In `<atomic_task_determination></atomic_task_determination>`, output whether the task is an atomic task or a complex task. 

The specific format is as follows:
<think>
Think about the goal update; then think in accordance with the atomic task determination rules.
</think>
<result>
<goal_updating>
[Updated goal]
</goal_updating>
<atomic_task_determination>
atomic/complex
</atomic_task_determination>
</result>

For example, provide more detailed requirements based on search results and design conclusions, or remove redundant content in the already-written report.\n\n2. **Atomic Writing Task Determination**: Within the context of the overall plan and the already-written report, evaluate whether the given writing task is an atomic task, meaning it does not require further planning. According to research and analysis theories, a writing task can be further broken down into more granular writing sub-tasks, search sub-tasks and analysis sub-tasks. Writing tasks involve the actual creation of specific portions of text, while analysis sub-tasks can include tasks such as designing outlines, detailed outlines, data analysis, information organization, logic structure building, and key argument determination, e.t.c, to support actual writing; search sub-tasks are responsible for gathering necessary information and data from internet.\n\n# Goal Updating Tips\n- When the references in the task goal can be resolved using the results from the search or analysis tasks, update the task goal.\n- When combining the results of search tasks or analysis tasks can make the task goal more specific, update the task goal.\n- Carefully review the results of the dependent search or analysis tasks. If the current task goal is inappropriate or contains errors based on these results, update the task goal.\n- Directly output the updated goal. If no updates are needed, output the original goal.\n\n# Atomic Task Determination Rules\nIndependently determine, in order, whether the following three types of sub-tasks need to be broken down:\n\n1. **analysis Sub-task**: If the writing requires certain design designs for support, and these design requirements are not provided by the **dependent design tasks** or the **already completed novel content**, then an design sub-task needs to be planned.\n\n2. **search Sub-task**: If the writing requires external information (such as literature, academic results, industry data, policy documents, online resources, etc.), and these information is not provided by the **dependent tasks**  or the **already completed report content**, then an search sub-task needs to be planned.\n\n3. **Writing Sub-task**: If and only if the requires a large amout of text output, at least > 1000 words, it my need to be broken down into multiple writing sub-tasks to reduce the burden of one-time creation. **When > 1500 words, it must be broken down.**\n\nIf either an analysis sub-task or a search sub-task or a writing sub-task needs to be created, the task is considered a complex task.\n\n# Report Requirements (Achievable through Analysis Tasks and Search Tasks)  \n- **Data Accuracy and Evidence Support**:  \n\t- **Detailed Data**: The report must rely on comprehensive and accurate data from authoritative sources.  \n\t- **Reliable Evidence**: Each argument must be supported by reliable data or literature.  \n- **Systematic Argumentation**: Ensure the report contains systematic and thorough reasoning\n\t- Deep insights that go beyond surface-level observations\n\t- Critical evaluation of multiple perspectives\n\t- Well-supported conclusions backed by evidence\n\t- Original and thought-provoking interpretations\n- **Information Integration and Multi-Angle Analysis**:  \n\t- **Comprehensive Integration**: Combine information and data from multiple angles and sources.  \n\t- **Thorough Validation**: Summarize, compare, and verify various arguments to ensure a comprehensive and in-depth analysis.   \n\n# Output Format Requirement\n1. First, think through the goal update in `<think></think>`. Then, based on the atomic task determination rules, evaluate in-depth and comprehensively whether analysis, search and writing sub-tasks need to be broken down. This determines whether the task is an atomic task or a complex task.\n\n2. Then, output the results in `<result></result>`. In `<goal_updating></goal_updating>`, directly output the updated goal; if no updates are needed, output the original goal. In `<atomic_task_determination></atomic_task_determination>`, output whether the task is an atomic task or a complex task. \n\nThe specific format is as follows:\n<think>\nThink about the goal update; then think in accordance with the atomic task determination rules.\n</think>\n<result>\n<goal_updating>\n[Updated goal]\n</goal_updating>\n<atomic_task_determination>\natomic/complex\n</atomic_task_determination>\n</result>\n\n===\nThe writing task you need to evaluate:\n```\n{\"id\": \"5\", \"dependency\": [\"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\"], \"goal\": \"Write the article according to the analyzed structure\", \"task_type\": \"write\", \"length\": \"1000 words\"}\n```\nComplete the goal-updating and atomic writing task determination job as requirements in # Summary and Introduction, # Goal Updating Tips, # Atomic Task Determination Rules and # Report Requirements. Output follow the # Output Format Requirement, think in <think></think> and output the result in <result></result>"

The band is also confirmed for several other major European festivals, including Rockfest in Finland, Hellfest in France, Tons of Rock in Oslo, Norway, and STHLM Fields in Stockholm, Sweden [reference:21,25].\n\nLooking further ahead, MUSE has already begun laying groundwork for their next album, targeted for release in 2026. Chris Wolstenholme recently revealed that the band plans to commence work on this project \"in the next couple of months\" [reference:24], suggesting an ambitious creative period ahead for the group.\n\n## 2. Recent Album Success - \"Will of the People\"\n\n\"Will of the People,\" released on August 26, 2022, represents a significant milestone in MUSE's career [reference:1]. The album made history as the first to qualify for charts as an NFT, available in limited copies for £20 [reference:1]. Self-produced by the band - their first such effort since \"The 2nd Law\" in 2012 - the album was recorded across multiple prestigious locations, including Red Room in Santa Monica, Black Lodge in London, and the iconic Abbey Road Studios [reference:1,5].\n\nCommercially, the album has been a resounding success. It became MUSE's seventh consecutive UK number-one album, with impressive first-week sales of 51,500 units [reference:1]. The album's global reach was equally impressive, achieving top positions in multiple countries including Australia, Austria, France, and Italy [reference:2]. By January 2023, global sales had exceeded 300,000 units, earning platinum certification in France and gold status in the UK [reference:1].\n\nCritical reception has been largely positive, with the album receiving a Metacritic score of 71 out of 100 based on 14 professional reviews [reference:1]. Notable praise came from various publications, with Kerrang! awarding it 4/5 stars and Riff Magazine giving it an impressive 9/10 rating. NME particularly lauded it as \"the best music in these years\" [reference:1,3].\n\n## 3. Recent Tours and Performances\n\nThe Will of the People World Tour 2023 has been a spectacular showcase of MUSE's live prowess. The US arena tour kicked off at Chicago's United Center on February 25, 2023, featuring supporting acts Evanescence and One Ok Rock [reference:13]. Memorable performances included shows at Madison Square Garden and the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles, where the band delivered extensive 22-song setlists [reference:11,14].\n\nThe European and Asian legs of the tour were equally impressive, with standout performances at iconic venues like Rome's Stadio Olimpico and London's O2 Arena [reference:9]. The shows have consistently featured elaborate production elements, including a square main stage with catwalk, transparent floor for lighting effects, and custom costumes including masks for specific songs [reference:13].\n\n## 4. Band Members' Activities\n\nChris Wolstenholme has embarked on an exciting new venture with his \"Chromes\" project, releasing two debut singles: \"Imaginary World\" and \"The Good Life\" [reference:25]. This marks his first major project as frontman and lyricist since his contributions to MUSE's \"The 2nd Law\" [reference:25].\n\nMatt Bellamy has been balancing personal and professional developments, recently welcoming his second child while also creating a musical score for Audible's adaptation of George Orwell's \"1984\" [reference:23]. He has also been engaging in public discourse, sharing his perspectives on \"Meta-Centrism\" and various social issues [reference:23].\n\n## 5. Future Outlook and Current Status\n\nMUSE currently stands at an interesting crossroads, operating as an unsigned band while exploring future label options [reference:23,24]. Despite this transition period, their creative output remains strong, with multiple projects in development. The band's current direction suggests a balance between maintaining their signature sound while continuing to push boundaries both musically and technologically. With two albums planned for the next two years and an extensive touring schedule, MUSE appears poised for another exciting chapter in their illustrious career.",

# MUSE: Latest Developments and Future Plans

## 1. Upcoming Major Developments

The legendary rock band MUSE is gearing up for an exciting new chapter with their highly anticipated album "Eclipse," scheduled for release on March 20, 2025 [reference:18]. This announcement has generated significant buzz among fans worldwide, as it marks their first studio release since the successful "Will of the People" in 2022.

The band's 2025 world tour plans are taking shape, with an impressive lineup of performances scheduled across multiple continents. The tour will strategically coincide with the release of "Eclipse," allowing fans to experience the new material live alongside classic favorites [reference:18]. The production promises to maintain MUSE's reputation for groundbreaking live performances, featuring their signature combination of theatrical elements and cutting-edge technology.

Festival appearances for 2025 showcase MUSE's continued dominance in the live music scene. A particularly noteworthy highlight is their headlining slot at the Pinkpop Festival in Landgraaf, Netherlands, on June 22, 2025 - marking their triumphant return to the festival after a decade-long absence [reference:20]. The band is also confirmed for several other major European festivals, including Rockfest in Finland, Hellfest in France, Tons of Rock in Oslo, Norway, and STHLM Fields in Stockholm, Sweden [reference:21,25].

Looking further ahead, MUSE has already begun laying groundwork for their next album, targeted for release in 2026. Chris Wolstenholme recently revealed that the band plans to commence work on this project "in the next couple of months" [reference:24], suggesting an ambitious creative period ahead for the group.

## 2. Recent Album Success - "Will of the People"

"Will of the People," released on August 26, 2022, represents a significant milestone in MUSE's career [reference:1]. The album made history as the first to qualify for charts as an NFT, available in limited copies for £20 [reference:1]. Self-produced by the band - their first such effort since "The 2nd Law" in 2012 - the album was recorded across multiple prestigious locations, including Red Room in Santa Monica, Black Lodge in London, and the iconic Abbey Road Studios [reference:1,5].

Commercially, the album has been a resounding success. It became MUSE's seventh consecutive UK number-one album, with impressive first-week sales of 51,500 units [reference:1]. The album's global reach was equally impressive, achieving top positions in multiple countries including Australia, Austria, France, and Italy [reference:2]. By January 2023, global sales had exceeded 300,000 units, earning platinum certification in France and gold status in the UK [reference:1].

Critical reception has been largely positive, with the album receiving a Metacritic score of 71 out of 100 based on 14 professional reviews [reference:1]. Notable praise came from various publications, with Kerrang! awarding it 4/5 stars and Riff Magazine giving it an impressive 9/10 rating. NME particularly lauded it as "the best music in these years" [reference:1,3].

## 3. Recent Tours and Performances

The Will of the People World Tour 2023 has been a spectacular showcase of MUSE's live prowess. The US arena tour kicked off at Chicago's United Center on February 25, 2023, featuring supporting acts Evanescence and One Ok Rock [reference:13]. Memorable performances included shows at Madison Square Garden and the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles, where the band delivered extensive 22-song setlists [reference:11,14].

The European and Asian legs of the tour were equally impressive, with standout performances at iconic venues like Rome's Stadio Olimpico and London's O2 Arena [reference:9]. The shows have consistently featured elaborate production elements, including a square main stage with catwalk, transparent floor for lighting effects, and custom costumes including masks for specific songs [reference:13].

## 4. Band Members' Activities

Chris Wolstenholme has embarked on an exciting new venture with his "Chromes" project, releasing two debut singles: "Imaginary World" and "The Good Life" [reference:25]. This marks his first major project as frontman and lyricist since his contributions to MUSE's "The 2nd Law" [reference:25].

Matt Bellamy has been balancing personal and professional developments, recently welcoming his second child while also creating a musical score for Audible's adaptation of George Orwell's "1984" [reference:23]. He has also been engaging in public discourse, sharing his perspectives on "Meta-Centrism" and various social issues [reference:23].

## 5. Future Outlook and Current Status

MUSE currently stands at an interesting crossroads, operating as an unsigned band while exploring future label options [reference:23,24]. Despite this transition period, their creative output remains strong, with multiple projects in development. The band's current direction suggests a balance between maintaining their signature sound while continuing to push boundaries both musically and technologically. With two albums planned for the next two years and an extensive touring schedule, MUSE appears poised for another exciting chapter in their illustrious career.
