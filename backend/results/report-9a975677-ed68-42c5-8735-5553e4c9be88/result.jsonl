Upcoming Major Developments\n\nThe legendary rock band MUSE is gearing up for an exciting new chapter with their highly anticipated album \"Eclipse,\" scheduled for release on March 20, 2025 [reference:18]. This announcement has generated significant buzz among fans worldwide, as it marks their first studio release since the successful \"Will of the People\" in 2022.\n\nThe band's 2025 world tour plans are taking shape, with an impressive lineup of performances scheduled across multiple continents. The tour will strategically coincide with the release of \"Eclipse,\" allowing fans to experience the new material live alongside classic favorites [reference:18]. The production promises to maintain MUSE's reputation for groundbreaking live performances, featuring their signature combination of theatrical elements and cutting-edge technology.\n\nFestival appearances for 2025 showcase MUSE's continued dominance in the live music scene. A particularly noteworthy highlight is their headlining slot at the Pinkpop Festival in Landgraaf, Netherlands, on June 22, 2025 - marking their triumphant return to the festival after a decade-long absence [reference:20]. The band is also confirmed for several other major European festivals, including Rockfest in Finland, Hellfest in France, Tons of Rock in Oslo, Norway, and STHLM Fields in Stockholm, Sweden [reference:21,25].\n\nLooking further ahead, MUSE has already begun laying groundwork for their next album, targeted for release in 2026. Chris Wolstenholme recently revealed that the band plans to commence work on this project \"in the next couple of months\" [reference:24], suggesting an ambitious creative period ahead for the group.\n\n## 2. Recent Album Success - \"Will of the People\"\n\n\"Will of the People,\" released on August 26, 2022, represents a significant milestone in MUSE's career [reference:1]. The album made history as the first to qualify for charts as an NFT, available in limited copies for Â£20 [reference:1]. Self-produced by the band - their first such effort since \"The 2nd Law\" in 2012 - the album was recorded across multiple prestigious locations, including Red Room in Santa Monica, Black Lodge in London, and the iconic Abbey Road Studios [reference:1,5].\n\nCommercially, the album has been a resounding success. It became MUSE's seventh consecutive UK number-one album, with impressive first-week sales of 51,500 units [reference:1]. The album's global reach was equally impressive, achieving top positions in multiple countries including Australia, Austria, France, and Italy [reference:2]. By January 2023, global sales had exceeded 300,000 units, earning platinum certification in France and gold status in the UK [reference:1].\n\nCritical reception has been largely positive, with the album receiving a Metacritic score of 71 out of 100 based on 14 professional reviews [reference:1]. Notable praise came from various publications, with Kerrang! awarding it 4/5 stars and Riff Magazine giving it an impressive 9/10 rating. NME particularly lauded it as \"the best music in these years\" [reference:1,3].\n\n## 3. Recent Tours and Performances\n\nThe Will of the People World Tour 2023 has been a spectacular showcase of MUSE's live prowess. The US arena tour kicked off at Chicago's United Center on February 25, 2023, featuring supporting acts Evanescence and One Ok Rock [reference:13]. Memorable performances included shows at Madison Square Garden and the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles, where the band delivered extensive 22-song setlists [reference:11,14].\n\nThe European and Asian legs of the tour were equally impressive, with standout performances at iconic venues like Rome's Stadio Olimpico and London's O2 Arena [reference:9]. The shows have consistently featured elaborate production elements, including a square main stage with catwalk, transparent floor for lighting effects, and custom costumes including masks for specific songs [reference:13].\n\n## 4. Band Members' Activities\n\nChris Wolstenholme has embarked on an exciting new venture with his \"Chromes\" project, releasing two debut singles: \"Imaginary World\" and \"The Good Life\" [reference:25]. This marks his first major project as frontman and lyricist since his contributions to MUSE's \"The 2nd Law\" [reference:25].\n\nMatt Bellamy has been balancing personal and professional developments, recently welcoming his second child while also creating a musical score for Audible's adaptation of George Orwell's \"1984\" [reference:23]. He has also been engaging in public discourse, sharing his perspectives on \"Meta-Centrism\" and various social issues [reference:23].\n\n## 5. Future Outlook and Current Status\n\nMUSE currently stands at an interesting crossroads, operating as an unsigned band while exploring future label options [reference:23,24]. Despite this transition period, their creative output remains strong, with multiple projects in development. The band's current direction suggests a balance between maintaining their signature sound while continuing to push boundaries both musically and technologically. With two albums planned for the next two years and an extensive touring schedule, MUSE appears poised for another exciting chapter in their illustrious career."}
