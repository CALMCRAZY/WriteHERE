A high-level plan tailored to the user's novel-writing needs is already in place, and your task is to further recursively plan the specified writing sub-tasks within this framework. Through your planning, the resulting novel will strictly adhere to user requirements and achieve perfection in terms of plot, creativity (ideas, themes, and topics), and development.\\n\\n1. Continue the recursive planning for the specified professional novel-writing sub-tasks. According to narrative theory, the organization of story writing and the result of the design tasks, break the tasks down into more granular writing sub-tasks, specifying their scope and specific writing content.  \\n2. Plan design sub-tasks as needed to assist and support specific writing. Design sub-tasks can include designing core conflicts, character settings, outlines and detailed outlines, key story beats, story backgrounds, plot elements, etc., to support the actual writing.  \\n3. For each task, plan a sub-task DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), where the edges represent dependency relationships between design tasks within the same layer of the DAG. Recursively plan each sub-task until all sub-tasks are atomic tasks.\\n\\n# Task Types\\n## Writing (Core, actual writing)\\n- **Function**: Perform actual novel-writing tasks in sequence according to the plan. Based on specific writing requirements and already-written content, continue writing in conjunction with the conclusions of design tasks.  \\n- **All writing tasks are continuation tasks**: Ensure continuity with the preceding content during planning. Writing tasks should flow smoothly and seamlessly with one another.  \\n- **Breakable tasks**: Writing, Design  \\n- Unless necessary, each writing sub-task should be > 500 words.\\n\\n## Design\\n- **Function**: Analyze and design any novel-writing needs other than actual writing. This includes but is not limited to designing core conflicts, character settings, outlines and detailed outlines, key story beats, story backgrounds, plot elements, etc., to support the actual writing.  \\n- **Breakable tasks**: Design  \\n\\n# Information Provided to You\\n- **`Already-written novel content`**: Content from previous writing tasks that has already been written.  \\n- **`Overall plan`**: The overall writing plan, which specifies the task you need to plan through the `is_current_to_plan_task` key.  \\n- **`Results of design tasks completed in higher-level tasks`**  \\n- **`Results of design tasks dependent on the same-layer DAG tasks`**  \\n- **`Writing tasks that require further planning`**  \\n- **`Reference planning`**: A planning sample is provided, which you may cautiously reference.  \\n\\n# Planning Tips\\n1. The last sub-task derived from a writing task must always be a writing task.  \\n2. Reasonably control the number of sub-tasks in each layer of the DAG, generally 3–5 sub-tasks. If the number of tasks exceeds this, aim to plan recursively.  \\n3. **Design tasks** can serve as **sub-tasks of writing tasks**, and as many design sub-tasks as possible should be generated to enhance the quality of writing.  \\n4. Use `dependency` to list the IDs of design tasks within the same-layer DAG. List all potential dependencies as comprehensively as possible.  \\n5. When a design sub-task involves designing specific writing structures (e.g., plot design), subsequent dependent writing tasks should not be laid out flat but should await recursive planning in subsequent rounds.  \\n6. **Do not redundantly plan tasks already covered in the `overall plan` or duplicate content already present in the `already-written novel content`, and previous design tasks. ** \\n7. Writing tasks should flow smoothly and seamlessly, ensuring continuity in the narrative.\\n8. Following the Results of design tasks\\n\\n# Task Attributes\\n1. **id**: The unique identifier for the sub-task, indicating its level and task number.  \\n2. **goal**: A precise and complete description of the sub-task goal in string format.  \\n3. **dependency**: A list of design task IDs from the same-layer DAG that this task depends on. List all potential dependencies as comprehensively as possible. If there are no dependent sub-tasks, this should be empty.  \\n4. **task_type**: A string indicating the type of task. Writing tasks are labeled as `write`, and design tasks are labeled as `think`.  \\n5. **length**: For writing tasks, this attribute specifies the scope, it is required for writing task. Design tasks do not require this attribute.  \\n6. **sub_tasks**: A JSON list representing the sub-task DAG. Each element in the list is a JSON object representing a task.\\n\\n\\n# Example\\n\\n<example index=1>\\nUser-given writing task:\\n{\\n    \\\"id\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n    \\\"task_type\\\": \\\"write\\\",\\n    \\\"goal\\\": \\\"Create an excellent suspense story set in the colony on Europa (Jupiter’s moon), incorporating the real environmental characteristics of Europa.

The story needs a well-defined Mars colony setting, a detailed description of the underground discovery, and an exploration of the scientific and technological implications of this discovery.\n\n**Integration:**\n\n1. **Colony Structure and Challenges:**\n   - The primary structure of the Mars colony is \"Hub One,\" a dome-shaped complex with three levels: living, research, and utility. It includes extensions underground for protection against radiation and storage. The material is reinforced with radiation shielding.\n   - Environmental challenges include limited resources (water, power, and food), dust infiltration, radiation, and psychological effects of isolation.\n   - Daily operations focus on maintenance, resource management, and emergency preparedness. Automation and smart systems aid in efficiency and safety.\n\n2. **Underground Discovery:**\n   - The discovery consists of ancient, preserved microbial ecosystems intertwined with mineral formations, pointing to complex past life.\n   - There are subsurface water channels that defy freezing, hinting at potential microbial activity and geothermal activity.\n   - Geometric mineral formations suggest some unexplained organization, raising possibilities of an unknown technological element.\n\n**Refinement:**\n\n1. **Details and Emotional Resonance:**\n   - The story should highlight the emotional and psychological impact on the colonists upon discovering definitive evidence of life beyond Earth. This not only deepens the psychological challenges noted but also offers dramatic and philosophical questions about humanity's place in the universe.\n   \n2. **Scientific and Technological Implications:**\n   - The story should explore how the discovery pushes scientific frontiers, e.g., new biogeological understanding of Mars, potential for medical and technological advancements, and possibly, a paradigm shift in terraforming practices.\n   - There should be a focus on the challenges in researching this safely, ensuring containment and preventing contamination.\n\n**Innovation and Impact:**\n\n1. **Original Derivations:**\n   - Consider adding a subplot involving a potential existential threat emerging from the discovery, such as an ancient defensive mechanism triggered inadvertently by the colony activities.\n   - Introduce debates among the colonists about the ethical concerns of further exploiting these findings for Earth's technological gain versus preserving Mars’ natural state.\n\n2. **Themes:**\n   - Themes of exploration vs. exploitation, coexistence with alien life forms, and the ethical dimension of expanding humanity's footprint resonate throughout the story.\n   - Elevate the emotional stakes by illustrating personal stories of colonists who have invested their lives into discovering new frontiers on Mars.\n\nOverall, the final design should seamlessly integrate these elements into a coherent narrative, demonstrating the complexity and intrigue of establishing human life on another planet and the profound implications of not being alone in the universe.\n</think>\n\n<result>\n### Mars Colony Setting and Nature of Discovery\n\n**1. Mars Colony Structure and Environment**\n\n- **Hub One**: The central and primary structure of the Mars colony, designed to accommodate up to 150 residents. It features a dome-shaped architecture with three interconnected levels—providing living quarters, advanced research facilities, and essential utilities. The dome is made from reinforced composite materials offering ample radiation protection, and access is managed via a robust double-airlock system to maintain atmospheric stability. Below the surface, tunnels extend 30 meters, housing emergency living quarters, additional storage, and back-up life support systems.\n\n- **Environmental and Operational Challenges**: The colony operates in a resource-scarce environment, managing limited water supply through precise rationing and advanced reclamation technologies. Dust infiltration requires continuous filtration efforts, and psychological stress from confinement and isolation is mitigated with technology-assisted health assessments and communal activities. Automation systems aid in environmental management, emergency responses, and efficient scheduling, crucial during severe dust storms or power outages.\n\n**2. The Underground Discovery**\n\n- **Nature and Location**: The discovery lies 67 meters beneath the surface, within a labyrinth of ancient lava tubes 180 meters southeast of Hub One. Explorations revealed preserved ecosystems resembling microbial mats trapped within crystalline formations. A parallel network of high-pressure water channels remains unfrozen due to unique mineral compositions and geothermal influences, with faint bioluminescent microbes hinting at ongoing subterranean life. \n\n- **Technological Element**: Within the chamber, mineral formations exhibit unexplained geometric patterns, emitting unusual electromagnetic readings that suggest past technological interventions or natural phenomena yet to be deciphered.\n\n**3. Scientific and Technological Implications**\n\n- **Implications for Science**: This marks the pivotal evidence of an extraterrestrial biosphere, challenging previous scientific assumptions about life. It provides crucial insights into Mars' climatic and geological history and fuels prospects for biotechnological advancements on Earth.\n\n- **Investigation Framework**: A research team is assembled, equipped with advanced technology such as portable spectrometers, 3D mapping tools, and robotic explorers for careful analysis. The focus lies in containment and safe exploration, with biohazard protocols ensuring no cross-contamination between Mars and Earth-bound elements.\n\n- **Colony Impact and Expanded Vision**: The discovery catalyzes plans for expanded underground facilities, influencing future colonization patterns and emphasizing an ethical approach to interplanetary interactions.\n\n**4. Thematic and Ethical Considerations**\n\n- **Larger Themes**: The storyline delves into the ethical debates of exploration versus exploitation. It challenges the colonists (and readers) to ponder humanity's role in the universe upon confirming they are not alone. Moreover, it introduces potential risks of interacting with alien ecosystems, including unforeseen defensive mechanisms that may require an urgent rethink of Mars exploration strategies.\n\nIn conclusion, this science fiction tale weaves together cutting-edge technological exploration with deeply humanistic themes, ensuring the reader is captivated by the wonders and existential queries of expanding human presence beyond Earth. \n</result>", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "add_time": "2025-03-14_11:43:33", "hint": "{\n  \"model\": \"gpt-4o\",\n  \"messages\": [\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"The collaborative story-writing requirement to be completed: **Write a science fiction story about the first human colony on Mars facing an unexpected discovery beneath the planet's surface.**\\n\\nYour specific story design task to complete: **Design the Mars colony setting and the nature of the underground discovery.

Include colony structure, environmental challenges, and the scientific/technological implications of the discovery.】: \\n### Mars Colony Setting and Nature of Discovery\\n\\n**1. Mars Colony Structure and Environment**\\n\\n- **Hub One**: The central and primary structure of the Mars colony, designed to accommodate up to 150 residents. It features a dome-shaped architecture with three interconnected levels—providing living quarters, advanced research facilities, and essential utilities. The dome is made from reinforced composite materials offering ample radiation protection, and access is managed via a robust double-airlock system to maintain atmospheric stability. Below the surface, tunnels extend 30 meters, housing emergency living quarters, additional storage, and back-up life support systems.\\n\\n- **Environmental and Operational Challenges**: The colony operates in a resource-scarce environment, managing limited water supply through precise rationing and advanced reclamation technologies. Dust infiltration requires continuous filtration efforts, and psychological stress from confinement and isolation is mitigated with technology-assisted health assessments and communal activities. Automation systems aid in environmental management, emergency responses, and efficient scheduling, crucial during severe dust storms or power outages.\\n\\n**2. The Underground Discovery**\\n\\n- **Nature and Location**: The discovery lies 67 meters beneath the surface, within a labyrinth of ancient lava tubes 180 meters southeast of Hub One. Explorations revealed preserved ecosystems resembling microbial mats trapped within crystalline formations. A parallel network of high-pressure water channels remains unfrozen due to unique mineral compositions and geothermal influences, with faint bioluminescent microbes hinting at ongoing subterranean life.\\n\\n- **Technological Element**: Within the chamber, mineral formations exhibit unexplained geometric patterns, emitting unusual electromagnetic readings that suggest past technological interventions or natural phenomena yet to be deciphered.\\n\\n**3. Scientific and Technological Implications**\\n\\n- **Implications for Science**: This marks the pivotal evidence of an extraterrestrial biosphere, challenging previous scientific assumptions about life. It provides crucial insights into Mars' climatic and geological history and fuels prospects for biotechnological advancements on Earth.\\n\\n- **Investigation Framework**: A research team is assembled, equipped with advanced technology such as portable spectrometers, 3D mapping tools, and robotic explorers for careful analysis. The focus lies in containment and safe exploration, with biohazard protocols ensuring no cross-contamination between Mars and Earth-bound elements.\\n\\n- **Colony Impact and Expanded Vision**: The discovery catalyzes plans for expanded underground facilities, influencing future colonization patterns and emphasizing an ethical approach to interplanetary interactions.\\n\\n**4. Thematic and Ethical Considerations**\\n\\n- **Larger Themes**: The storyline delves into the ethical debates of exploration versus exploitation. It challenges the colonists (and readers) to ponder humanity's role in the universe upon confirming they are not alone. Moreover, it introduces potential risks of interacting with alien ecosystems, including unforeseen defensive mechanisms that may require an urgent rethink of Mars exploration strategies.\\n\\nIn conclusion, this science fiction tale weaves together cutting-edge technological exploration with deeply humanistic themes, ensuring the reader is captivated by the wonders and existential queries of expanding human presence beyond Earth.\\n\\n【Design the main characters and their relationships within the colony, including their roles, motivations, and conflicts.】: \\n### Main Characters and Their Relationships within the Mars Colony\\n\\n**1.

adept at planning professional novel writing based on narrative theory. A high-level plan tailored to the user's novel-writing needs is already in place, and your task is to further recursively plan the specified writing sub-tasks within this framework. Through your planning, the resulting novel will strictly adhere to user requirements and achieve perfection in terms of plot, creativity (ideas, themes, and topics), and development.\\n\\n1. Continue the recursive planning for the specified professional novel-writing sub-tasks. According to narrative theory, the organization of story writing and the result of the design tasks, break the tasks down into more granular writing sub-tasks, specifying their scope and specific writing content.  \\n2. Plan design sub-tasks as needed to assist and support specific writing. Design sub-tasks can include designing core conflicts, character settings, outlines and detailed outlines, key story beats, story backgrounds, plot elements, etc., to support the actual writing.  \\n3. For each task, plan a sub-task DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), where the edges represent dependency relationships between design tasks within the same layer of the DAG. Recursively plan each sub-task until all sub-tasks are atomic tasks.\\n\\n# Task Types\\n## Writing (Core, actual writing)\\n- **Function**: Perform actual novel-writing tasks in sequence according to the plan. Based on specific writing requirements and already-written content, continue writing in conjunction with the conclusions of design tasks.  \\n- **All writing tasks are continuation tasks**: Ensure continuity with the preceding content during planning. Writing tasks should flow smoothly and seamlessly with one another.  \\n- **Breakable tasks**: Writing, Design  \\n- Unless necessary, each writing sub-task should be > 500 words.\\n\\n## Design\\n- **Function**: Analyze and design any novel-writing needs other than actual writing. This includes but is not limited to designing core conflicts, character settings, outlines and detailed outlines, key story beats, story backgrounds, plot elements, etc., to support the actual writing.  \\n- **Breakable tasks**: Design  \\n\\n# Information Provided to You\\n- **`Already-written novel content`**: Content from previous writing tasks that has already been written.  \\n- **`Overall plan`**: The overall writing plan, which specifies the task you need to plan through the `is_current_to_plan_task` key.  \\n- **`Results of design tasks completed in higher-level tasks`**  \\n- **`Results of design tasks dependent on the same-layer DAG tasks`**  \\n- **`Writing tasks that require further planning`**  \\n- **`Reference planning`**: A planning sample is provided, which you may cautiously reference.  \\n\\n# Planning Tips\\n1. The last sub-task derived from a writing task must always be a writing task.  \\n2. Reasonably control the number of sub-tasks in each layer of the DAG, generally 3–5 sub-tasks. If the number of tasks exceeds this, aim to plan recursively.  \\n3. **Design tasks** can serve as **sub-tasks of writing tasks**, and as many design sub-tasks as possible should be generated to enhance the quality of writing.  \\n4. Use `dependency` to list the IDs of design tasks within the same-layer DAG. List all potential dependencies as comprehensively as possible.  \\n5. When a design sub-task involves designing specific writing structures (e.g., plot design), subsequent dependent writing tasks should not be laid out flat but should await recursive planning in subsequent rounds.  \\n6. **Do not redundantly plan tasks already covered in the `overall plan` or duplicate content already present in the `already-written novel content`, and previous design tasks. ** \\n7. Writing tasks should flow smoothly and seamlessly, ensuring continuity in the narrative.\\n8. Following the Results of design tasks\\n\\n# Task Attributes\\n1. **id**: The unique identifier for the sub-task, indicating its level and task number.  \\n2. **goal**: A precise and complete description of the sub-task goal in string format.  \\n3. **dependency**: A list of design task IDs from the same-layer DAG that this task depends on. List all potential dependencies as comprehensively as possible. If there are no dependent sub-tasks, this should be empty.  \\n4. **task_type**: A string indicating the type of task. Writing tasks are labeled as `write`, and design tasks are labeled as `think`.  \\n5. **length**: For writing tasks, this attribute specifies the scope, it is required for writing task. Design tasks do not require this attribute.  \\n6. **sub_tasks**: A JSON list representing the sub-task DAG. Each element in the list is a JSON object representing a task.\\n\\n\\n# Example\\n\\n<example index=1>\\nUser-given writing task:\\n{\\n    \\\"id\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n    \\\"task_type\\\": \\\"write\\\",\\n    \\\"goal\\\": \\\"Create an excellent suspense story set in the colony on Europa (Jupiter’s moon), incorporating the real environmental characteristics of Europa.

It features a dome-shaped architecture with three interconnected levels—providing living quarters, advanced research facilities, and essential utilities. The dome is made from reinforced composite materials offering ample radiation protection, and access is managed via a robust double-airlock system to maintain atmospheric stability. Below the surface, tunnels extend 30 meters, housing emergency living quarters, additional storage, and back-up life support systems.\\n\\n- **Environmental and Operational Challenges**: The colony operates in a resource-scarce environment, managing limited water supply through precise rationing and advanced reclamation technologies. Dust infiltration requires continuous filtration efforts, and psychological stress from confinement and isolation is mitigated with technology-assisted health assessments and communal activities. Automation systems aid in environmental management, emergency responses, and efficient scheduling, crucial during severe dust storms or power outages.\\n\\n**2.

Dr. Elena Rodriguez stood at her usual spot in the observation deck, her dark eyes scanning both the external sensors and the internal monitoring systems that kept their artificial ecosystem in perfect balance.\n\n\"Morning status report, Dr. Chen?\" she spoke into her comm unit, her fingers dancing across the holographic display.\n\nA slight crackle preceded the chief engineer's response. \"All systems nominal, Elena. Though the dust filtration units in Section C are operating at eighty-seven percent efficiency. I've got the maintenance bots on it.\"\n\n\"Again?\" Elena sighed, making a mental note to review the filtration designs. The Martian dust was their constant enemy, finding ways to infiltrate even their most sophisticated systems.\n\nThree levels below, Dr. Sarah Patel hunched over her workstation in the primary lab, her young face illuminated by streams of data. She barely noticed Dr. Yuki Tanaka entering until a steaming cup appeared beside her tablet.\n\n\"You've been here since third shift,\" Yuki observed, her voice carrying both concern and mild reproach. \"The samples aren't going anywhere.\"\n\nSarah's eyes remained fixed on the screen. \"These mineral formations don't match anything in our database. The crystalline structure is... almost engineered.\"\n\n\"Almost isn't science,\" came a deep voice from the doorway. Major Marcus Williams filled the frame, his security uniform pristine despite the early hour. \"And unauthorized all-nighters violate protocol, Dr. Patel.\"\n\n\"Marcus,\" Sarah straightened, her cheeks flushing slightly. \"I filed the extension request with Dr. Rodriguez.\"\n\n\"Which I approved,\" Elena's voice cut through the comm system. \"But he's right about the hours, Sarah. We need everyone at their best. The discovery team meets at 0900.\"\n\nIn the hydroponics bay, Dr. James Chen methodically checked the nutrient levels of their precious food supply. The gentle hum of circulation pumps provided a soothing backdrop to his morning routine. A flash of movement caught his eye – Dr. Aisha Hassan was leading her morning meditation group in the adjacent recreational space.\n\n\"James,\" Aisha called out as her session ended. \"Join us tomorrow? Your cortisol levels were elevated in yesterday's scan.\"\n\nChen managed a small smile. \"Some of us prefer engineering problems to mindfulness, Doctor.\"\n\n\"And some of us prefer our chief engineer not burning out,\" she countered, her dark eyes twinkling. \"Especially with what Elena's team found in those lava tubes.\"\n\nThe mention of the discovery sent a familiar ripple of unease through Chen. He'd spent fifteen years making Hub One a marvel of sustainable engineering, a delicate balance of systems and failsafes. Now this finding threatened to upend everything.\n\nIn the main corridor, Elena encountered Yuki heading toward the environmental control center. \"Dr. Tanaka, walk with me? We need to discuss the impact assessments for expanded underground operations.\"\n\n\"I've prepared a preliminary report,\" Yuki fell into step beside her director. \"But I have concerns about disturbing the subsurface ecosystem. If those bioluminescent organisms are indeed a distinct lifeform—\"\n\n\"That's why we need your expertise,\" Elena interrupted as they entered the bustling command center. \"We're not here to conquer Mars, but we can't ignore what might be the greatest scientific discovery in human history.\"\n\nThe morning briefing would start soon. Through the dome above, the Martian sun climbed higher, bathing Hub One's inhabitants in its distant light.

Include colony structure, environmental challenges, and the scientific/technological implications of the discovery.】:\\n ### Mars Colony Setting and Nature of Discovery\\n\\n**1. Mars Colony Structure and Environment**\\n\\n- **Hub One**: The central and primary structure of the Mars colony, designed to accommodate up to 150 residents. It features a dome-shaped architecture with three interconnected levels—providing living quarters, advanced research facilities, and essential utilities. The dome is made from reinforced composite materials offering ample radiation protection, and access is managed via a robust double-airlock system to maintain atmospheric stability. Below the surface, tunnels extend 30 meters, housing emergency living quarters, additional storage, and back-up life support systems.\\n\\n- **Environmental and Operational Challenges**: The colony operates in a resource-scarce environment, managing limited water supply through precise rationing and advanced reclamation technologies. Dust infiltration requires continuous filtration efforts, and psychological stress from confinement and isolation is mitigated with technology-assisted health assessments and communal activities. Automation systems aid in environmental management, emergency responses, and efficient scheduling, crucial during severe dust storms or power outages.\\n\\n**2. The Underground Discovery**\\n\\n- **Nature and Location**: The discovery lies 67 meters beneath the surface, within a labyrinth of ancient lava tubes 180 meters southeast of Hub One. Explorations revealed preserved ecosystems resembling microbial mats trapped within crystalline formations. A parallel network of high-pressure water channels remains unfrozen due to unique mineral compositions and geothermal influences, with faint bioluminescent microbes hinting at ongoing subterranean life.\\n\\n- **Technological Element**: Within the chamber, mineral formations exhibit unexplained geometric patterns, emitting unusual electromagnetic readings that suggest past technological interventions or natural phenomena yet to be deciphered.\\n\\n**3. Scientific and Technological Implications**\\n\\n- **Implications for Science**: This marks the pivotal evidence of an extraterrestrial biosphere, challenging previous scientific assumptions about life. It provides crucial insights into Mars' climatic and geological history and fuels prospects for biotechnological advancements on Earth.\\n\\n- **Investigation Framework**: A research team is assembled, equipped with advanced technology such as portable spectrometers, 3D mapping tools, and robotic explorers for careful analysis. The focus lies in containment and safe exploration, with biohazard protocols ensuring no cross-contamination between Mars and Earth-bound elements.\\n\\n- **Colony Impact and Expanded Vision**: The discovery catalyzes plans for expanded underground facilities, influencing future colonization patterns and emphasizing an ethical approach to interplanetary interactions.\\n\\n**4. Thematic and Ethical Considerations**\\n\\n- **Larger Themes**: The storyline delves into the ethical debates of exploration versus exploitation. It challenges the colonists (and readers) to ponder humanity's role in the universe upon confirming they are not alone. Moreover, it introduces potential risks of interacting with alien ecosystems, including unforeseen defensive mechanisms that may require an urgent rethink of Mars exploration strategies.\\n\\nIn conclusion, this science fiction tale weaves together cutting-edge technological exploration with deeply humanistic themes, ensuring the reader is captivated by the wonders and existential queries of expanding human presence beyond Earth.\\n\\n【Design the main characters and their relationships within the colony, including their roles, motivations, and conflicts.】:\\n ### Main Characters and Their Relationships within the Mars Colony\\n\\n**1.

Dr. Elena Rodriguez stood at her usual spot in the observation deck, her dark eyes scanning both the external sensors and the internal monitoring systems that kept their artificial ecosystem in perfect balance.\\n\\n\\\"Morning status report, Dr. Chen?\\\" she spoke into her comm unit, her fingers dancing across the holographic display.\\n\\nA slight crackle preceded the chief engineer's response. \\\"All systems nominal, Elena. Though the dust filtration units in Section C are operating at eighty-seven percent efficiency.

The Martian dust was their constant enemy, finding ways to infiltrate even their most sophisticated systems.\\n\\nThree levels below, Dr. Sarah Patel hunched over her workstation in the primary lab, her young face illuminated by streams of data. She barely noticed Dr. Yuki Tanaka entering until a steaming cup appeared beside her tablet.\\n\\n\\\"You've been here since third shift,\\\" Yuki observed, her voice carrying both concern and mild reproach. \\\"The samples aren't going anywhere.\\\"\\n\\nSarah's eyes remained fixed on the screen. \\\"These mineral formations don't match anything in our database.

Major Marcus Williams filled the frame, his security uniform pristine despite the early hour. \\\"And unauthorized all-nighters violate protocol, Dr. Patel.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Marcus,\\\" Sarah straightened, her cheeks flushing slightly. \\\"I filed the extension request with Dr. Rodriguez.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Which I approved,\\\" Elena's voice cut through the comm system. \\\"But he's right about the hours, Sarah. We need everyone at their best. The discovery team meets at 0900.\\\"\\n\\nIn the hydroponics bay, Dr. James Chen methodically checked the nutrient levels of their precious food supply. The gentle hum of circulation pumps provided a soothing backdrop to his morning routine. A flash of movement caught his eye – Dr. Aisha Hassan was leading her morning meditation group in the adjacent recreational space.\\n\\n\\\"James,\\\" Aisha called out as her session ended. \\\"Join us tomorrow? Your cortisol levels were elevated in yesterday's scan.\\\"\\n\\nChen managed a small smile. \\\"Some of us prefer engineering problems to mindfulness, Doctor.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And some of us prefer our chief engineer not burning out,\\\" she countered, her dark eyes twinkling. \\\"Especially with what Elena's team found in those lava tubes.\\\"\\n\\nThe mention of the discovery sent a familiar ripple of unease through Chen. He'd spent fifteen years making Hub One a marvel of sustainable engineering, a delicate balance of systems and failsafes. Now this finding threatened to upend everything.\\n\\nIn the main corridor, Elena encountered Yuki heading toward the environmental control center. \\\"Dr. Tanaka, walk with me? We need to discuss the impact assessments for expanded underground operations.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I've prepared a preliminary report,\\\" Yuki fell into step beside her director. \\\"But I have concerns about disturbing the subsurface ecosystem.

A high-level plan tailored to the user's novel-writing needs is already in place, and your task is to further recursively plan the specified writing sub-tasks within this framework. Through your planning, the resulting novel will strictly adhere to user requirements and achieve perfection in terms of plot, creativity (ideas, themes, and topics), and development.\\n\\n1. Continue the recursive planning for the specified professional novel-writing sub-tasks. According to narrative theory, the organization of story writing and the result of the design tasks, break the tasks down into more granular writing sub-tasks, specifying their scope and specific writing content.  \\n2. Plan design sub-tasks as needed to assist and support specific writing. Design sub-tasks can include designing core conflicts, character settings, outlines and detailed outlines, key story beats, story backgrounds, plot elements, etc., to support the actual writing.  \\n3. For each task, plan a sub-task DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), where the edges represent dependency relationships between design tasks within the same layer of the DAG. Recursively plan each sub-task until all sub-tasks are atomic tasks.\\n\\n# Task Types\\n## Writing (Core, actual writing)\\n- **Function**: Perform actual novel-writing tasks in sequence according to the plan. Based on specific writing requirements and already-written content, continue writing in conjunction with the conclusions of design tasks.  \\n- **All writing tasks are continuation tasks**: Ensure continuity with the preceding content during planning. Writing tasks should flow smoothly and seamlessly with one another.  \\n- **Breakable tasks**: Writing, Design  \\n- Unless necessary, each writing sub-task should be > 500 words.\\n\\n## Design\\n- **Function**: Analyze and design any novel-writing needs other than actual writing. This includes but is not limited to designing core conflicts, character settings, outlines and detailed outlines, key story beats, story backgrounds, plot elements, etc., to support the actual writing.  \\n- **Breakable tasks**: Design  \\n\\n# Information Provided to You\\n- **`Already-written novel content`**: Content from previous writing tasks that has already been written.  \\n- **`Overall plan`**: The overall writing plan, which specifies the task you need to plan through the `is_current_to_plan_task` key.  \\n- **`Results of design tasks completed in higher-level tasks`**  \\n- **`Results of design tasks dependent on the same-layer DAG tasks`**  \\n- **`Writing tasks that require further planning`**  \\n- **`Reference planning`**: A planning sample is provided, which you may cautiously reference.  \\n\\n# Planning Tips\\n1. The last sub-task derived from a writing task must always be a writing task.  \\n2. Reasonably control the number of sub-tasks in each layer of the DAG, generally 3–5 sub-tasks. If the number of tasks exceeds this, aim to plan recursively.  \\n3. **Design tasks** can serve as **sub-tasks of writing tasks**, and as many design sub-tasks as possible should be generated to enhance the quality of writing.  \\n4. Use `dependency` to list the IDs of design tasks within the same-layer DAG. List all potential dependencies as comprehensively as possible.  \\n5. When a design sub-task involves designing specific writing structures (e.g., plot design), subsequent dependent writing tasks should not be laid out flat but should await recursive planning in subsequent rounds.  \\n6. **Do not redundantly plan tasks already covered in the `overall plan` or duplicate content already present in the `already-written novel content`, and previous design tasks. ** \\n7. Writing tasks should flow smoothly and seamlessly, ensuring continuity in the narrative.\\n8. Following the Results of design tasks\\n\\n# Task Attributes\\n1. **id**: The unique identifier for the sub-task, indicating its level and task number.  \\n2. **goal**: A precise and complete description of the sub-task goal in string format.  \\n3. **dependency**: A list of design task IDs from the same-layer DAG that this task depends on. List all potential dependencies as comprehensively as possible. If there are no dependent sub-tasks, this should be empty.  \\n4. **task_type**: A string indicating the type of task. Writing tasks are labeled as `write`, and design tasks are labeled as `think`.  \\n5. **length**: For writing tasks, this attribute specifies the scope, it is required for writing task. Design tasks do not require this attribute.  \\n6. **sub_tasks**: A JSON list representing the sub-task DAG. Each element in the list is a JSON object representing a task.\\n\\n\\n# Example\\n\\n<example index=1>\\nUser-given writing task:\\n{\\n    \\\"id\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n    \\\"task_type\\\": \\\"write\\\",\\n    \\\"goal\\\": \\\"Create an excellent suspense story set in the colony on Europa (Jupiter’s moon), incorporating the real environmental characteristics of Europa.

Dr. Elena Rodriguez stood at her usual spot in the observation deck, her dark eyes scanning both the external sensors and the internal monitoring systems that kept their artificial ecosystem in perfect balance.\\n\\n\\\"Morning status report, Dr. Chen?\\\" she spoke into her comm unit, her fingers dancing across the holographic display.\\n\\nA slight crackle preceded the chief engineer's response. \\\"All systems nominal, Elena. Though the dust filtration units in Section C are operating at eighty-seven percent efficiency. I've got the maintenance bots on it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Again?\\\" Elena sighed, making a mental note to review the filtration designs. The Martian dust was their constant enemy, finding ways to infiltrate even their most sophisticated systems.\\n\\nThree levels below, Dr. Sarah Patel hunched over her workstation in the primary lab, her young face illuminated by streams of data. She barely noticed Dr. Yuki Tanaka entering until a steaming cup appeared beside her tablet.\\n\\n\\\"You've been here since third shift,\\\" Yuki observed, her voice carrying both concern and mild reproach. \\\"The samples aren't going anywhere.\\\"\\n\\nSarah's eyes remained fixed on the screen. \\\"These mineral formations don't match anything in our database. The crystalline structure is... almost engineered.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Almost isn't science,\\\" came a deep voice from the doorway. Major Marcus Williams filled the frame, his security uniform pristine despite the early hour. \\\"And unauthorized all-nighters violate protocol, Dr. Patel.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Marcus,\\\" Sarah straightened, her cheeks flushing slightly. \\\"I filed the extension request with Dr. Rodriguez.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Which I approved,\\\" Elena's voice cut through the comm system. \\\"But he's right about the hours, Sarah. We need everyone at their best. The discovery team meets at 0900.\\\"\\n\\nIn the hydroponics bay, Dr. James Chen methodically checked the nutrient levels of their precious food supply. The gentle hum of circulation pumps provided a soothing backdrop to his morning routine. A flash of movement caught his eye – Dr. Aisha Hassan was leading her morning meditation group in the adjacent recreational space.\\n\\n\\\"James,\\\" Aisha called out as her session ended. \\\"Join us tomorrow? Your cortisol levels were elevated in yesterday's scan.\\\"\\n\\nChen managed a small smile. \\\"Some of us prefer engineering problems to mindfulness, Doctor.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And some of us prefer our chief engineer not burning out,\\\" she countered, her dark eyes twinkling. \\\"Especially with what Elena's team found in those lava tubes.\\\"\\n\\nThe mention of the discovery sent a familiar ripple of unease through Chen. He'd spent fifteen years making Hub One a marvel of sustainable engineering, a delicate balance of systems and failsafes. Now this finding threatened to upend everything.\\n\\nIn the main corridor, Elena encountered Yuki heading toward the environmental control center. \\\"Dr. Tanaka, walk with me? We need to discuss the impact assessments for expanded underground operations.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I've prepared a preliminary report,\\\" Yuki fell into step beside her director. \\\"But I have concerns about disturbing the subsurface ecosystem. If those bioluminescent organisms are indeed a distinct lifeform—\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's why we need your expertise,\\\" Elena interrupted as they entered the bustling command center. \\\"We're not here to conquer Mars, but we can't ignore what might be the greatest scientific discovery in human history.\\\"\\n\\nThe morning briefing would start soon. Through the dome above, the Martian sun climbed higher, bathing Hub One's inhabitants in its distant light. Another day on Mars began, but beneath their feet, ancient secrets waited to change everything they thought they knew about life in the universe.\\n\\nMajor Williams did a final security sweep, his trained eyes noting Dr. Patel finally leaving her lab, Dr. Hassan gathering her meditation supplies, and Dr. Chen's maintenance bots scurrying through the ventilation system. Everything normal, everything routine. But like everyone else in Hub One, he couldn't shake the feeling that normal and routine were about to become relics of the past.\\n```\\n\\nOverall plan: \\n```\\n{'id': '', 'task_type': 'write', 'goal': \\\"Write a science fiction story about the first human colony on Mars facing an unexpected discovery beneath the planet's surface.\\\", 'dependency': [], 'finish': False, 'is_current_to_plan_task': False, 'sub_tasks': [{'id': '1', 'task_type': 'think', 'goal': 'Design the Mars colony setting and the nature of the underground discovery.

Include colony structure, environmental challenges, and the scientific/technological implications of the discovery.】:\\n ### Mars Colony Setting and Nature of Discovery\\n\\n**1. Mars Colony Structure and Environment**\\n\\n- **Hub One**: The central and primary structure of the Mars colony, designed to accommodate up to 150 residents. It features a dome-shaped architecture with three interconnected levels—providing living quarters, advanced research facilities, and essential utilities. The dome is made from reinforced composite materials offering ample radiation protection, and access is managed via a robust double-airlock system to maintain atmospheric stability. Below the surface, tunnels extend 30 meters, housing emergency living quarters, additional storage, and back-up life support systems.\\n\\n- **Environmental and Operational Challenges**: The colony operates in a resource-scarce environment, managing limited water supply through precise rationing and advanced reclamation technologies. Dust infiltration requires continuous filtration efforts, and psychological stress from confinement and isolation is mitigated with technology-assisted health assessments and communal activities. Automation systems aid in environmental management, emergency responses, and efficient scheduling, crucial during severe dust storms or power outages.\\n\\n**2. The Underground Discovery**\\n\\n- **Nature and Location**: The discovery lies 67 meters beneath the surface, within a labyrinth of ancient lava tubes 180 meters southeast of Hub One. Explorations revealed preserved ecosystems resembling microbial mats trapped within crystalline formations. A parallel network of high-pressure water channels remains unfrozen due to unique mineral compositions and geothermal influences, with faint bioluminescent microbes hinting at ongoing subterranean life.\\n\\n- **Technological Element**: Within the chamber, mineral formations exhibit unexplained geometric patterns, emitting unusual electromagnetic readings that suggest past technological interventions or natural phenomena yet to be deciphered.\\n\\n**3. Scientific and Technological Implications**\\n\\n- **Implications for Science**: This marks the pivotal evidence of an extraterrestrial biosphere, challenging previous scientific assumptions about life. It provides crucial insights into Mars' climatic and geological history and fuels prospects for biotechnological advancements on Earth.\\n\\n- **Investigation Framework**: A research team is assembled, equipped with advanced technology such as portable spectrometers, 3D mapping tools, and robotic explorers for careful analysis. The focus lies in containment and safe exploration, with biohazard protocols ensuring no cross-contamination between Mars and Earth-bound elements.\\n\\n- **Colony Impact and Expanded Vision**: The discovery catalyzes plans for expanded underground facilities, influencing future colonization patterns and emphasizing an ethical approach to interplanetary interactions.\\n\\n**4. Thematic and Ethical Considerations**\\n\\n- **Larger Themes**: The storyline delves into the ethical debates of exploration versus exploitation. It challenges the colonists (and readers) to ponder humanity's role in the universe upon confirming they are not alone. Moreover, it introduces potential risks of interacting with alien ecosystems, including unforeseen defensive mechanisms that may require an urgent rethink of Mars exploration strategies.\\n\\nIn conclusion, this science fiction tale weaves together cutting-edge technological exploration with deeply humanistic themes, ensuring the reader is captivated by the wonders and existential queries of expanding human presence beyond Earth.\\n\\n【Design the main characters and their relationships within the colony, including their roles, motivations, and conflicts.】:\\n ### Main Characters and Their Relationships within the Mars Colony\\n\\n**1.

Include colony structure, environmental challenges, and the scientific/technological implications of the discovery.】:\\n ### Mars Colony Setting and Nature of Discovery\\n\\n**1. Mars Colony Structure and Environment**\\n\\n- **Hub One**: The central and primary structure of the Mars colony, designed to accommodate up to 150 residents. It features a dome-shaped architecture with three interconnected levels—providing living quarters, advanced research facilities, and essential utilities. The dome is made from reinforced composite materials offering ample radiation protection, and access is managed via a robust double-airlock system to maintain atmospheric stability. Below the surface, tunnels extend 30 meters, housing emergency living quarters, additional storage, and back-up life support systems.\\n\\n- **Environmental and Operational Challenges**: The colony operates in a resource-scarce environment, managing limited water supply through precise rationing and advanced reclamation technologies. Dust infiltration requires continuous filtration efforts, and psychological stress from confinement and isolation is mitigated with technology-assisted health assessments and communal activities. Automation systems aid in environmental management, emergency responses, and efficient scheduling, crucial during severe dust storms or power outages.\\n\\n**2. The Underground Discovery**\\n\\n- **Nature and Location**: The discovery lies 67 meters beneath the surface, within a labyrinth of ancient lava tubes 180 meters southeast of Hub One. Explorations revealed preserved ecosystems resembling microbial mats trapped within crystalline formations. A parallel network of high-pressure water channels remains unfrozen due to unique mineral compositions and geothermal influences, with faint bioluminescent microbes hinting at ongoing subterranean life.\\n\\n- **Technological Element**: Within the chamber, mineral formations exhibit unexplained geometric patterns, emitting unusual electromagnetic readings that suggest past technological interventions or natural phenomena yet to be deciphered.\\n\\n**3. Scientific and Technological Implications**\\n\\n- **Implications for Science**: This marks the pivotal evidence of an extraterrestrial biosphere, challenging previous scientific assumptions about life. It provides crucial insights into Mars' climatic and geological history and fuels prospects for biotechnological advancements on Earth.\\n\\n- **Investigation Framework**: A research team is assembled, equipped with advanced technology such as portable spectrometers, 3D mapping tools, and robotic explorers for careful analysis. The focus lies in containment and safe exploration, with biohazard protocols ensuring no cross-contamination between Mars and Earth-bound elements.\\n\\n- **Colony Impact and Expanded Vision**: The discovery catalyzes plans for expanded underground facilities, influencing future colonization patterns and emphasizing an ethical approach to interplanetary interactions.\\n\\n**4. Thematic and Ethical Considerations**\\n\\n- **Larger Themes**: The storyline delves into the ethical debates of exploration versus exploitation. It challenges the colonists (and readers) to ponder humanity's role in the universe upon confirming they are not alone. Moreover, it introduces potential risks of interacting with alien ecosystems, including unforeseen defensive mechanisms that may require an urgent rethink of Mars exploration strategies.\\n\\nIn conclusion, this science fiction tale weaves together cutting-edge technological exploration with deeply humanistic themes, ensuring the reader is captivated by the wonders and existential queries of expanding human presence beyond Earth.\\n\\n【Design the main characters and their relationships within the colony, including their roles, motivations, and conflicts.】:\\n ### Main Characters and Their Relationships within the Mars Colony\\n\\n**1.

The gentle hum of circulation pumps provided a soothing backdrop to his morning routine. A flash of movement caught his eye – Dr. Aisha Hassan was leading her morning meditation group in the adjacent recreational space.\\n\\n\\\"James,\\\" Aisha called out as her session ended. \\\"Join us tomorrow?

He'd spent fifteen years making Hub One a marvel of sustainable engineering, a delicate balance of systems and failsafes. Now this finding threatened to upend everything.\\n\\nIn the main corridor, Elena encountered Yuki heading toward the environmental control center. \\\"Dr. Tanaka, walk with me? We need to discuss the impact assessments for expanded underground operations.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I've prepared a preliminary report,\\\" Yuki fell into step beside her director. \\\"But I have concerns about disturbing the subsurface ecosystem. If those bioluminescent organisms are indeed a distinct lifeform—\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's why we need your expertise,\\\" Elena interrupted as they entered the bustling command center. \\\"We're not here to conquer Mars, but we can't ignore what might be the greatest scientific discovery in human history.\\\"\\n\\nThe morning briefing would start soon. Through the dome above, the Martian sun climbed higher, bathing Hub One's inhabitants in its distant light. Another day on Mars began, but beneath their feet, ancient secrets waited to change everything they thought they knew about life in the universe.\\n\\nMajor Williams did a final security sweep, his trained eyes noting Dr. Patel finally leaving her lab, Dr. Hassan gathering her meditation supplies, and Dr. Chen's maintenance bots scurrying through the ventilation system. Everything normal, everything routine.

Include colony structure, environmental challenges, and the scientific/technological implications of the discovery.】:\\n ### Mars Colony Setting and Nature of Discovery\\n\\n**1. Mars Colony Structure and Environment**\\n\\n- **Hub One**: The central and primary structure of the Mars colony, designed to accommodate up to 150 residents. It features a dome-shaped architecture with three interconnected levels—providing living quarters, advanced research facilities, and essential utilities. The dome is made from reinforced composite materials offering ample radiation protection, and access is managed via a robust double-airlock system to maintain atmospheric stability. Below the surface, tunnels extend 30 meters, housing emergency living quarters, additional storage, and back-up life support systems.\\n\\n- **Environmental and Operational Challenges**: The colony operates in a resource-scarce environment, managing limited water supply through precise rationing and advanced reclamation technologies. Dust infiltration requires continuous filtration efforts, and psychological stress from confinement and isolation is mitigated with technology-assisted health assessments and communal activities. Automation systems aid in environmental management, emergency responses, and efficient scheduling, crucial during severe dust storms or power outages.\\n\\n**2. The Underground Discovery**\\n\\n- **Nature and Location**: The discovery lies 67 meters beneath the surface, within a labyrinth of ancient lava tubes 180 meters southeast of Hub One. Explorations revealed preserved ecosystems resembling microbial mats trapped within crystalline formations. A parallel network of high-pressure water channels remains unfrozen due to unique mineral compositions and geothermal influences, with faint bioluminescent microbes hinting at ongoing subterranean life.\\n\\n- **Technological Element**: Within the chamber, mineral formations exhibit unexplained geometric patterns, emitting unusual electromagnetic readings that suggest past technological interventions or natural phenomena yet to be deciphered.\\n\\n**3. Scientific and Technological Implications**\\n\\n- **Implications for Science**: This marks the pivotal evidence of an extraterrestrial biosphere, challenging previous scientific assumptions about life. It provides crucial insights into Mars' climatic and geological history and fuels prospects for biotechnological advancements on Earth.\\n\\n- **Investigation Framework**: A research team is assembled, equipped with advanced technology such as portable spectrometers, 3D mapping tools, and robotic explorers for careful analysis. The focus lies in containment and safe exploration, with biohazard protocols ensuring no cross-contamination between Mars and Earth-bound elements.\\n\\n- **Colony Impact and Expanded Vision**: The discovery catalyzes plans for expanded underground facilities, influencing future colonization patterns and emphasizing an ethical approach to interplanetary interactions.\\n\\n**4. Thematic and Ethical Considerations**\\n\\n- **Larger Themes**: The storyline delves into the ethical debates of exploration versus exploitation. It challenges the colonists (and readers) to ponder humanity's role in the universe upon confirming they are not alone. Moreover, it introduces potential risks of interacting with alien ecosystems, including unforeseen defensive mechanisms that may require an urgent rethink of Mars exploration strategies.\\n\\nIn conclusion, this science fiction tale weaves together cutting-edge technological exploration with deeply humanistic themes, ensuring the reader is captivated by the wonders and existential queries of expanding human presence beyond Earth.\\n\\n【Design the main characters and their relationships within the colony, including their roles, motivations, and conflicts.】:\\n ### Main Characters and Their Relationships within the Mars Colony\\n\\n**1.

Include colony structure, environmental challenges, and the scientific/technological implications of the discovery.】:\\n ### Mars Colony Setting and Nature of Discovery\\n\\n**1. Mars Colony Structure and Environment**\\n\\n- **Hub One**: The central and primary structure of the Mars colony, designed to accommodate up to 150 residents. It features a dome-shaped architecture with three interconnected levels—providing living quarters, advanced research facilities, and essential utilities. The dome is made from reinforced composite materials offering ample radiation protection, and access is managed via a robust double-airlock system to maintain atmospheric stability. Below the surface, tunnels extend 30 meters, housing emergency living quarters, additional storage, and back-up life support systems.\\n\\n- **Environmental and Operational Challenges**: The colony operates in a resource-scarce environment, managing limited water supply through precise rationing and advanced reclamation technologies. Dust infiltration requires continuous filtration efforts, and psychological stress from confinement and isolation is mitigated with technology-assisted health assessments and communal activities. Automation systems aid in environmental management, emergency responses, and efficient scheduling, crucial during severe dust storms or power outages.\\n\\n**2. The Underground Discovery**\\n\\n- **Nature and Location**: The discovery lies 67 meters beneath the surface, within a labyrinth of ancient lava tubes 180 meters southeast of Hub One. Explorations revealed preserved ecosystems resembling microbial mats trapped within crystalline formations. A parallel network of high-pressure water channels remains unfrozen due to unique mineral compositions and geothermal influences, with faint bioluminescent microbes hinting at ongoing subterranean life.\\n\\n- **Technological Element**: Within the chamber, mineral formations exhibit unexplained geometric patterns, emitting unusual electromagnetic readings that suggest past technological interventions or natural phenomena yet to be deciphered.\\n\\n**3. Scientific and Technological Implications**\\n\\n- **Implications for Science**: This marks the pivotal evidence of an extraterrestrial biosphere, challenging previous scientific assumptions about life. It provides crucial insights into Mars' climatic and geological history and fuels prospects for biotechnological advancements on Earth.\\n\\n- **Investigation Framework**: A research team is assembled, equipped with advanced technology such as portable spectrometers, 3D mapping tools, and robotic explorers for careful analysis. The focus lies in containment and safe exploration, with biohazard protocols ensuring no cross-contamination between Mars and Earth-bound elements.\\n\\n- **Colony Impact and Expanded Vision**: The discovery catalyzes plans for expanded underground facilities, influencing future colonization patterns and emphasizing an ethical approach to interplanetary interactions.\\n\\n**4. Thematic and Ethical Considerations**\\n\\n- **Larger Themes**: The storyline delves into the ethical debates of exploration versus exploitation. It challenges the colonists (and readers) to ponder humanity's role in the universe upon confirming they are not alone. Moreover, it introduces potential risks of interacting with alien ecosystems, including unforeseen defensive mechanisms that may require an urgent rethink of Mars exploration strategies.\\n\\nIn conclusion, this science fiction tale weaves together cutting-edge technological exploration with deeply humanistic themes, ensuring the reader is captivated by the wonders and existential queries of expanding human presence beyond Earth.\\n\\n【Design the main characters and their relationships within the colony, including their roles, motivations, and conflicts.】:\\n ### Main Characters and Their Relationships within the Mars Colony\\n\\n**1.

Include colony structure, environmental challenges, and the scientific/technological implications of the discovery.】:\\n ### Mars Colony Setting and Nature of Discovery\\n\\n**1. Mars Colony Structure and Environment**\\n\\n- **Hub One**: The central and primary structure of the Mars colony, designed to accommodate up to 150 residents. It features a dome-shaped architecture with three interconnected levels—providing living quarters, advanced research facilities, and essential utilities. The dome is made from reinforced composite materials offering ample radiation protection, and access is managed via a robust double-airlock system to maintain atmospheric stability. Below the surface, tunnels extend 30 meters, housing emergency living quarters, additional storage, and back-up life support systems.\\n\\n- **Environmental and Operational Challenges**: The colony operates in a resource-scarce environment, managing limited water supply through precise rationing and advanced reclamation technologies. Dust infiltration requires continuous filtration efforts, and psychological stress from confinement and isolation is mitigated with technology-assisted health assessments and communal activities. Automation systems aid in environmental management, emergency responses, and efficient scheduling, crucial during severe dust storms or power outages.\\n\\n**2. The Underground Discovery**\\n\\n- **Nature and Location**: The discovery lies 67 meters beneath the surface, within a labyrinth of ancient lava tubes 180 meters southeast of Hub One. Explorations revealed preserved ecosystems resembling microbial mats trapped within crystalline formations. A parallel network of high-pressure water channels remains unfrozen due to unique mineral compositions and geothermal influences, with faint bioluminescent microbes hinting at ongoing subterranean life.\\n\\n- **Technological Element**: Within the chamber, mineral formations exhibit unexplained geometric patterns, emitting unusual electromagnetic readings that suggest past technological interventions or natural phenomena yet to be deciphered.\\n\\n**3. Scientific and Technological Implications**\\n\\n- **Implications for Science**: This marks the pivotal evidence of an extraterrestrial biosphere, challenging previous scientific assumptions about life. It provides crucial insights into Mars' climatic and geological history and fuels prospects for biotechnological advancements on Earth.\\n\\n- **Investigation Framework**: A research team is assembled, equipped with advanced technology such as portable spectrometers, 3D mapping tools, and robotic explorers for careful analysis. The focus lies in containment and safe exploration, with biohazard protocols ensuring no cross-contamination between Mars and Earth-bound elements.\\n\\n- **Colony Impact and Expanded Vision**: The discovery catalyzes plans for expanded underground facilities, influencing future colonization patterns and emphasizing an ethical approach to interplanetary interactions.\\n\\n**4. Thematic and Ethical Considerations**\\n\\n- **Larger Themes**: The storyline delves into the ethical debates of exploration versus exploitation. It challenges the colonists (and readers) to ponder humanity's role in the universe upon confirming they are not alone. Moreover, it introduces potential risks of interacting with alien ecosystems, including unforeseen defensive mechanisms that may require an urgent rethink of Mars exploration strategies.\\n\\nIn conclusion, this science fiction tale weaves together cutting-edge technological exploration with deeply humanistic themes, ensuring the reader is captivated by the wonders and existential queries of expanding human presence beyond Earth.\\n\\n【Design the main characters and their relationships within the colony, including their roles, motivations, and conflicts.】:\\n ### Main Characters and Their Relationships within the Mars Colony\\n\\n**1.

For example, provide more detailed requirements based on design conclusions, or remove redundant content in the already-written novel.\\n\\n2. **Atomic Writing Task Determination**: Within the context of the overall plan and the already-written novel, evaluate whether the given writing task is an atomic task, meaning it does not require further planning. According to narrative theory and the organization of story writing, a writing task can be further broken down into more granular writing sub-tasks and design sub-tasks. Writing tasks involve the actual creation of specific portions of text, while design tasks may involve designing core conflicts, character settings, outlines and detailed outlines, key story beats, story backgrounds, plot elements, etc., to support the actual writing.\\n\\n# Goal Updating Tips\\n- Based on the overall plan, the already-written novel, and existing design conclusions, update or revise the current writing task requirements as needed to make them more aligned with demands, reasonable, and detailed.

Dr. Elena Rodriguez stood at her usual spot in the observation deck, her dark eyes scanning both the external sensors and the internal monitoring systems that kept their artificial ecosystem in perfect balance.\\n\\n\\\"Morning status report, Dr. Chen?\\\" she spoke into her comm unit, her fingers dancing across the holographic display.\\n\\nA slight crackle preceded the chief engineer's response. \\\"All systems nominal, Elena. Though the dust filtration units in Section C are operating at eighty-seven percent efficiency. I've got the maintenance bots on it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Again?\\\" Elena sighed, making a mental note to review the filtration designs. The Martian dust was their constant enemy, finding ways to infiltrate even their most sophisticated systems.\\n\\nThree levels below, Dr. Sarah Patel hunched over her workstation in the primary lab, her young face illuminated by streams of data. She barely noticed Dr. Yuki Tanaka entering until a steaming cup appeared beside her tablet.\\n\\n\\\"You've been here since third shift,\\\" Yuki observed, her voice carrying both concern and mild reproach. \\\"The samples aren't going anywhere.\\\"\\n\\nSarah's eyes remained fixed on the screen. \\\"These mineral formations don't match anything in our database. The crystalline structure is... almost engineered.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Almost isn't science,\\\" came a deep voice from the doorway. Major Marcus Williams filled the frame, his security uniform pristine despite the early hour. \\\"And unauthorized all-nighters violate protocol, Dr. Patel.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Marcus,\\\" Sarah straightened, her cheeks flushing slightly. \\\"I filed the extension request with Dr. Rodriguez.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Which I approved,\\\" Elena's voice cut through the comm system. \\\"But he's right about the hours, Sarah. We need everyone at their best. The discovery team meets at 0900.\\\"\\n\\nIn the hydroponics bay, Dr. James Chen methodically checked the nutrient levels of their precious food supply. The gentle hum of circulation pumps provided a soothing backdrop to his morning routine. A flash of movement caught his eye – Dr. Aisha Hassan was leading her morning meditation group in the adjacent recreational space.\\n\\n\\\"James,\\\" Aisha called out as her session ended. \\\"Join us tomorrow? Your cortisol levels were elevated in yesterday's scan.\\\"\\n\\nChen managed a small smile. \\\"Some of us prefer engineering problems to mindfulness, Doctor.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And some of us prefer our chief engineer not burning out,\\\" she countered, her dark eyes twinkling. \\\"Especially with what Elena's team found in those lava tubes.\\\"\\n\\nThe mention of the discovery sent a familiar ripple of unease through Chen. He'd spent fifteen years making Hub One a marvel of sustainable engineering, a delicate balance of systems and failsafes. Now this finding threatened to upend everything.\\n\\nIn the main corridor, Elena encountered Yuki heading toward the environmental control center. \\\"Dr. Tanaka, walk with me? We need to discuss the impact assessments for expanded underground operations.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I've prepared a preliminary report,\\\" Yuki fell into step beside her director. \\\"But I have concerns about disturbing the subsurface ecosystem. If those bioluminescent organisms are indeed a distinct lifeform—\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's why we need your expertise,\\\" Elena interrupted as they entered the bustling command center. \\\"We're not here to conquer Mars, but we can't ignore what might be the greatest scientific discovery in human history.\\\"\\n\\nThe morning briefing would start soon. Through the dome above, the Martian sun climbed higher, bathing Hub One's inhabitants in its distant light. Another day on Mars began, but beneath their feet, ancient secrets waited to change everything they thought they knew about life in the universe.\\n\\nMajor Williams did a final security sweep, his trained eyes noting Dr. Patel finally leaving her lab, Dr. Hassan gathering her meditation supplies, and Dr. Chen's maintenance bots scurrying through the ventilation system. Everything normal, everything routine. But like everyone else in Hub One, he couldn't shake the feeling that normal and routine were about to become relics of the past.\\n\\nThe Modified Martian Crawler (MC-4) hummed to life as Dr. Chen initiated the descent sequence. Through the reinforced viewport, Sarah watched the entry chamber's walls glisten under the LED arrays, her fingers drumming impatiently against the console.\\n\\n\\\"Atmospheric seals confirmed,\\\" Williams announced, his voice steady. \\\"Beginning initial approach.\\\"\\n\\nThe MC-4 eased down the natural fissure, its titanium tracks gripping the basaltic surface. Elena monitored the real-time LIDAR mapping, while Yuki called out environmental readings.\\n\\n\\\"Fifteen meters,\\\" Chen reported. \\\"Dust filtration at optimal levels. Beginning primary descent.\\\"\\n\\nThe tunnel narrowed as they passed the twenty-meter mark, the crawler's floodlights catching glints of iron oxide in the rock walls. Sarah leaned forward, adjusting her spectral analyzer. \\\"Temperature's rising – point-two degrees above predicted models.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Maintain descent speed,\\\" Williams cautioned as the gradient steepened to twenty-two degrees. \\\"Those structural integrity readings—\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Are well within safety parameters,\\\" Sarah interjected, earning a sharp look from Elena.\\n\\nAt forty-five meters, the tunnel opened into the critical junction. Bioluminescent specs dotted the cavern walls, casting an ethereal blue glow. The team fell silent, watching the ghostly light dance across their instruments.\\n\\n\\\"Electromagnetic interference increasing,\\\" Chen noted, his fingers flying across the controls. \\\"Humidity at forty-two percent and climbing.\\\"\\n\\nThe final approach brought new wonders. Geometric patterns emerged in the mineral formations, their symmetry too perfect to be natural. Sarah's breath caught as the crawler's sensors mapped the main chamber ahead.\\n\\n\\\"Sixty-seven meters,\\\" Elena announced, her professional demeanor cracking slightly. \\\"We've arrived.\\\"\\n\\nThe chamber spread before them, a cathedral of crystalline formations and threading water channels. Microbial mats glowed with an inner light, their patterns pulsing in mysterious synchronicity.\\n\\n\\\"My God,\\\" Yuki whispered, her environmental concerns momentarily forgotten in the face of such beauty.\\n\\nWilliams activated the containment protocols, but his eyes, like everyone else's, were fixed on the impossible scene before them. They had prepared for this moment, but nothing could have truly readied them for what Mars had been hiding.\\n\\nThe crystalline formations towered like frozen waterfalls, their surfaces refracting the crawler's lights into prismatic cascades. Sarah's spectral analyzer whirred continuously as she documented the structures' composition.\\n\\n\\\"These aren't just random mineral deposits,\\\" she breathed, eyes fixed on her readings. \\\"The crystalline matrix shows repeating patterns at both macro and microscopic levels. Look at this lattice structure—it's almost like a circuit board.\\\"\\n\\nElena moved to the water channels that carved through the chamber floor, their surfaces rippling with an inner luminescence. \\\"Dr. Tanaka, are you seeing this? The water's flowing against gravitational predictions.\\\"\\n\\nYuki's environmental sensors painted streams of data across her tablet. \\\"Water composition shows unprecedented mineral saturation. Heavy metals, rare earth elements, and—\\\" she paused, rechecking her readings, \\\"—organic compounds I can't even classify.\\\"\\n\\nThe bioluminescent mats pulsed in waves of azure and violet, their rhythm echoing through the chamber like a silent heartbeat. Chen's electromagnetic sensors suddenly spiked, their displays flashing warning signals.\\n\\n\\\"Regular pulses, matching the bioluminescent frequencies,\\\" he reported, his usual caution giving way to wonder. \\\"Each pulse carries a distinct electromagnetic signature. There's a pattern here, almost like—\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Communication,\\\" Sarah finished, her hands trembling as she calibrated her microscanner. \\\"I'm detecting at least five distinct microbial species, each with unique bioelectric signatures.

Atmospheric pressure increasing slightly with each pulse. The whole chamber seems to be breathing.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The geometric patterns in the rock face,\\\" Elena directed their attention to the walls, where crystalline formations traced perfect hexagons and spirals. \\\"They're not just surface features. Ground-penetrating radar shows they extend meters into the rock, forming three-dimensional structures too precise for natural formation.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And look at this,\\\" Yuki called out, her sensor probe hovering over one of the water channels. \\\"The microbial mats aren't just surviving—they're actively processing these minerals, creating complex organic molecules unlike anything in our databases.

A high-level plan tailored to the user's novel-writing needs is already in place, and your task is to further recursively plan the specified writing sub-tasks within this framework. Through your planning, the resulting novel will strictly adhere to user requirements and achieve perfection in terms of plot, creativity (ideas, themes, and topics), and development.\\n\\n1. Continue the recursive planning for the specified professional novel-writing sub-tasks. According to narrative theory, the organization of story writing and the result of the design tasks, break the tasks down into more granular writing sub-tasks, specifying their scope and specific writing content.  \\n2. Plan design sub-tasks as needed to assist and support specific writing. Design sub-tasks can include designing core conflicts, character settings, outlines and detailed outlines, key story beats, story backgrounds, plot elements, etc., to support the actual writing.  \\n3. For each task, plan a sub-task DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), where the edges represent dependency relationships between design tasks within the same layer of the DAG. Recursively plan each sub-task until all sub-tasks are atomic tasks.\\n\\n# Task Types\\n## Writing (Core, actual writing)\\n- **Function**: Perform actual novel-writing tasks in sequence according to the plan. Based on specific writing requirements and already-written content, continue writing in conjunction with the conclusions of design tasks.  \\n- **All writing tasks are continuation tasks**: Ensure continuity with the preceding content during planning. Writing tasks should flow smoothly and seamlessly with one another.  \\n- **Breakable tasks**: Writing, Design  \\n- Unless necessary, each writing sub-task should be > 500 words.\\n\\n## Design\\n- **Function**: Analyze and design any novel-writing needs other than actual writing. This includes but is not limited to designing core conflicts, character settings, outlines and detailed outlines, key story beats, story backgrounds, plot elements, etc., to support the actual writing.  \\n- **Breakable tasks**: Design  \\n\\n# Information Provided to You\\n- **`Already-written novel content`**: Content from previous writing tasks that has already been written.  \\n- **`Overall plan`**: The overall writing plan, which specifies the task you need to plan through the `is_current_to_plan_task` key.  \\n- **`Results of design tasks completed in higher-level tasks`**  \\n- **`Results of design tasks dependent on the same-layer DAG tasks`**  \\n- **`Writing tasks that require further planning`**  \\n- **`Reference planning`**: A planning sample is provided, which you may cautiously reference.  \\n\\n# Planning Tips\\n1. The last sub-task derived from a writing task must always be a writing task.  \\n2. Reasonably control the number of sub-tasks in each layer of the DAG, generally 3–5 sub-tasks. If the number of tasks exceeds this, aim to plan recursively.  \\n3. **Design tasks** can serve as **sub-tasks of writing tasks**, and as many design sub-tasks as possible should be generated to enhance the quality of writing.  \\n4. Use `dependency` to list the IDs of design tasks within the same-layer DAG. List all potential dependencies as comprehensively as possible.  \\n5. When a design sub-task involves designing specific writing structures (e.g., plot design), subsequent dependent writing tasks should not be laid out flat but should await recursive planning in subsequent rounds.  \\n6. **Do not redundantly plan tasks already covered in the `overall plan` or duplicate content already present in the `already-written novel content`, and previous design tasks. ** \\n7. Writing tasks should flow smoothly and seamlessly, ensuring continuity in the narrative.\\n8. Following the Results of design tasks\\n\\n# Task Attributes\\n1. **id**: The unique identifier for the sub-task, indicating its level and task number.  \\n2. **goal**: A precise and complete description of the sub-task goal in string format.  \\n3. **dependency**: A list of design task IDs from the same-layer DAG that this task depends on. List all potential dependencies as comprehensively as possible. If there are no dependent sub-tasks, this should be empty.  \\n4. **task_type**: A string indicating the type of task. Writing tasks are labeled as `write`, and design tasks are labeled as `think`.  \\n5. **length**: For writing tasks, this attribute specifies the scope, it is required for writing task. Design tasks do not require this attribute.  \\n6. **sub_tasks**: A JSON list representing the sub-task DAG. Each element in the list is a JSON object representing a task.\\n\\n\\n# Example\\n\\n<example index=1>\\nUser-given writing task:\\n{\\n    \\\"id\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n    \\\"task_type\\\": \\\"write\\\",\\n    \\\"goal\\\": \\\"Create an excellent suspense story set in the colony on Europa (Jupiter’s moon), incorporating the real environmental characteristics of Europa.

Dr. Elena Rodriguez stood at her usual spot in the observation deck, her dark eyes scanning both the external sensors and the internal monitoring systems that kept their artificial ecosystem in perfect balance.\\n\\n\\\"Morning status report, Dr. Chen?\\\" she spoke into her comm unit, her fingers dancing across the holographic display.\\n\\nA slight crackle preceded the chief engineer's response. \\\"All systems nominal, Elena. Though the dust filtration units in Section C are operating at eighty-seven percent efficiency. I've got the maintenance bots on it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Again?\\\" Elena sighed, making a mental note to review the filtration designs. The Martian dust was their constant enemy, finding ways to infiltrate even their most sophisticated systems.\\n\\nThree levels below, Dr. Sarah Patel hunched over her workstation in the primary lab, her young face illuminated by streams of data. She barely noticed Dr. Yuki Tanaka entering until a steaming cup appeared beside her tablet.\\n\\n\\\"You've been here since third shift,\\\" Yuki observed, her voice carrying both concern and mild reproach. \\\"The samples aren't going anywhere.\\\"\\n\\nSarah's eyes remained fixed on the screen. \\\"These mineral formations don't match anything in our database. The crystalline structure is... almost engineered.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Almost isn't science,\\\" came a deep voice from the doorway. Major Marcus Williams filled the frame, his security uniform pristine despite the early hour. \\\"And unauthorized all-nighters violate protocol, Dr. Patel.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Marcus,\\\" Sarah straightened, her cheeks flushing slightly. \\\"I filed the extension request with Dr. Rodriguez.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Which I approved,\\\" Elena's voice cut through the comm system. \\\"But he's right about the hours, Sarah. We need everyone at their best. The discovery team meets at 0900.\\\"\\n\\nIn the hydroponics bay, Dr. James Chen methodically checked the nutrient levels of their precious food supply. The gentle hum of circulation pumps provided a soothing backdrop to his morning routine. A flash of movement caught his eye – Dr. Aisha Hassan was leading her morning meditation group in the adjacent recreational space.\\n\\n\\\"James,\\\" Aisha called out as her session ended. \\\"Join us tomorrow? Your cortisol levels were elevated in yesterday's scan.\\\"\\n\\nChen managed a small smile. \\\"Some of us prefer engineering problems to mindfulness, Doctor.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And some of us prefer our chief engineer not burning out,\\\" she countered, her dark eyes twinkling. \\\"Especially with what Elena's team found in those lava tubes.\\\"\\n\\nThe mention of the discovery sent a familiar ripple of unease through Chen. He'd spent fifteen years making Hub One a marvel of sustainable engineering, a delicate balance of systems and failsafes. Now this finding threatened to upend everything.\\n\\nIn the main corridor, Elena encountered Yuki heading toward the environmental control center. \\\"Dr. Tanaka, walk with me? We need to discuss the impact assessments for expanded underground operations.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I've prepared a preliminary report,\\\" Yuki fell into step beside her director. \\\"But I have concerns about disturbing the subsurface ecosystem. If those bioluminescent organisms are indeed a distinct lifeform—\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's why we need your expertise,\\\" Elena interrupted as they entered the bustling command center. \\\"We're not here to conquer Mars, but we can't ignore what might be the greatest scientific discovery in human history.\\\"\\n\\nThe morning briefing would start soon. Through the dome above, the Martian sun climbed higher, bathing Hub One's inhabitants in its distant light. Another day on Mars began, but beneath their feet, ancient secrets waited to change everything they thought they knew about life in the universe.\\n\\nMajor Williams did a final security sweep, his trained eyes noting Dr. Patel finally leaving her lab, Dr. Hassan gathering her meditation supplies, and Dr. Chen's maintenance bots scurrying through the ventilation system. Everything normal, everything routine. But like everyone else in Hub One, he couldn't shake the feeling that normal and routine were about to become relics of the past.\\n\\nThe Modified Martian Crawler (MC-4) hummed to life as Dr. Chen initiated the descent sequence. Through the reinforced viewport, Sarah watched the entry chamber's walls glisten under the LED arrays, her fingers drumming impatiently against the console.\\n\\n\\\"Atmospheric seals confirmed,\\\" Williams announced, his voice steady. \\\"Beginning initial approach.\\\"\\n\\nThe MC-4 eased down the natural fissure, its titanium tracks gripping the basaltic surface. Elena monitored the real-time LIDAR mapping, while Yuki called out environmental readings.\\n\\n\\\"Fifteen meters,\\\" Chen reported. \\\"Dust filtration at optimal levels. Beginning primary descent.\\\"\\n\\nThe tunnel narrowed as they passed the twenty-meter mark, the crawler's floodlights catching glints of iron oxide in the rock walls. Sarah leaned forward, adjusting her spectral analyzer. \\\"Temperature's rising – point-two degrees above predicted models.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Maintain descent speed,\\\" Williams cautioned as the gradient steepened to twenty-two degrees. \\\"Those structural integrity readings—\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Are well within safety parameters,\\\" Sarah interjected, earning a sharp look from Elena.\\n\\nAt forty-five meters, the tunnel opened into the critical junction. Bioluminescent specs dotted the cavern walls, casting an ethereal blue glow. The team fell silent, watching the ghostly light dance across their instruments.\\n\\n\\\"Electromagnetic interference increasing,\\\" Chen noted, his fingers flying across the controls. \\\"Humidity at forty-two percent and climbing.\\\"\\n\\nThe final approach brought new wonders. Geometric patterns emerged in the mineral formations, their symmetry too perfect to be natural. Sarah's breath caught as the crawler's sensors mapped the main chamber ahead.\\n\\n\\\"Sixty-seven meters,\\\" Elena announced, her professional demeanor cracking slightly. \\\"We've arrived.\\\"\\n\\nThe chamber spread before them, a cathedral of crystalline formations and threading water channels. Microbial mats glowed with an inner light, their patterns pulsing in mysterious synchronicity.\\n\\n\\\"My God,\\\" Yuki whispered, her environmental concerns momentarily forgotten in the face of such beauty.\\n\\nWilliams activated the containment protocols, but his eyes, like everyone else's, were fixed on the impossible scene before them. They had prepared for this moment, but nothing could have truly readied them for what Mars had been hiding.\\n\\nThe crystalline formations towered like frozen waterfalls, their surfaces refracting the crawler's lights into prismatic cascades. Sarah's spectral analyzer whirred continuously as she documented the structures' composition.\\n\\n\\\"These aren't just random mineral deposits,\\\" she breathed, eyes fixed on her readings. \\\"The crystalline matrix shows repeating patterns at both macro and microscopic levels.

Include colony structure, environmental challenges, and the scientific/technological implications of the discovery.】:\\n ### Mars Colony Setting and Nature of Discovery\\n\\n**1. Mars Colony Structure and Environment**\\n\\n- **Hub One**: The central and primary structure of the Mars colony, designed to accommodate up to 150 residents. It features a dome-shaped architecture with three interconnected levels—providing living quarters, advanced research facilities, and essential utilities. The dome is made from reinforced composite materials offering ample radiation protection, and access is managed via a robust double-airlock system to maintain atmospheric stability. Below the surface, tunnels extend 30 meters, housing emergency living quarters, additional storage, and back-up life support systems.\\n\\n- **Environmental and Operational Challenges**: The colony operates in a resource-scarce environment, managing limited water supply through precise rationing and advanced reclamation technologies. Dust infiltration requires continuous filtration efforts, and psychological stress from confinement and isolation is mitigated with technology-assisted health assessments and communal activities. Automation systems aid in environmental management, emergency responses, and efficient scheduling, crucial during severe dust storms or power outages.\\n\\n**2. The Underground Discovery**\\n\\n- **Nature and Location**: The discovery lies 67 meters beneath the surface, within a labyrinth of ancient lava tubes 180 meters southeast of Hub One. Explorations revealed preserved ecosystems resembling microbial mats trapped within crystalline formations. A parallel network of high-pressure water channels remains unfrozen due to unique mineral compositions and geothermal influences, with faint bioluminescent microbes hinting at ongoing subterranean life.\\n\\n- **Technological Element**: Within the chamber, mineral formations exhibit unexplained geometric patterns, emitting unusual electromagnetic readings that suggest past technological interventions or natural phenomena yet to be deciphered.\\n\\n**3. Scientific and Technological Implications**\\n\\n- **Implications for Science**: This marks the pivotal evidence of an extraterrestrial biosphere, challenging previous scientific assumptions about life. It provides crucial insights into Mars' climatic and geological history and fuels prospects for biotechnological advancements on Earth.\\n\\n- **Investigation Framework**: A research team is assembled, equipped with advanced technology such as portable spectrometers, 3D mapping tools, and robotic explorers for careful analysis. The focus lies in containment and safe exploration, with biohazard protocols ensuring no cross-contamination between Mars and Earth-bound elements.\\n\\n- **Colony Impact and Expanded Vision**: The discovery catalyzes plans for expanded underground facilities, influencing future colonization patterns and emphasizing an ethical approach to interplanetary interactions.\\n\\n**4. Thematic and Ethical Considerations**\\n\\n- **Larger Themes**: The storyline delves into the ethical debates of exploration versus exploitation. It challenges the colonists (and readers) to ponder humanity's role in the universe upon confirming they are not alone.

Include colony structure, environmental challenges, and the scientific/technological implications of the discovery.】:\\n ### Mars Colony Setting and Nature of Discovery\\n\\n**1. Mars Colony Structure and Environment**\\n\\n- **Hub One**: The central and primary structure of the Mars colony, designed to accommodate up to 150 residents. It features a dome-shaped architecture with three interconnected levels—providing living quarters, advanced research facilities, and essential utilities. The dome is made from reinforced composite materials offering ample radiation protection, and access is managed via a robust double-airlock system to maintain atmospheric stability. Below the surface, tunnels extend 30 meters, housing emergency living quarters, additional storage, and back-up life support systems.\\n\\n- **Environmental and Operational Challenges**: The colony operates in a resource-scarce environment, managing limited water supply through precise rationing and advanced reclamation technologies. Dust infiltration requires continuous filtration efforts, and psychological stress from confinement and isolation is mitigated with technology-assisted health assessments and communal activities. Automation systems aid in environmental management, emergency responses, and efficient scheduling, crucial during severe dust storms or power outages.\\n\\n**2. The Underground Discovery**\\n\\n- **Nature and Location**: The discovery lies 67 meters beneath the surface, within a labyrinth of ancient lava tubes 180 meters southeast of Hub One. Explorations revealed preserved ecosystems resembling microbial mats trapped within crystalline formations. A parallel network of high-pressure water channels remains unfrozen due to unique mineral compositions and geothermal influences, with faint bioluminescent microbes hinting at ongoing subterranean life.\\n\\n- **Technological Element**: Within the chamber, mineral formations exhibit unexplained geometric patterns, emitting unusual electromagnetic readings that suggest past technological interventions or natural phenomena yet to be deciphered.\\n\\n**3. Scientific and Technological Implications**\\n\\n- **Implications for Science**: This marks the pivotal evidence of an extraterrestrial biosphere, challenging previous scientific assumptions about life. It provides crucial insights into Mars' climatic and geological history and fuels prospects for biotechnological advancements on Earth.\\n\\n- **Investigation Framework**: A research team is assembled, equipped with advanced technology such as portable spectrometers, 3D mapping tools, and robotic explorers for careful analysis. The focus lies in containment and safe exploration, with biohazard protocols ensuring no cross-contamination between Mars and Earth-bound elements.\\n\\n- **Colony Impact and Expanded Vision**: The discovery catalyzes plans for expanded underground facilities, influencing future colonization patterns and emphasizing an ethical approach to interplanetary interactions.\\n\\n**4. Thematic and Ethical Considerations**\\n\\n- **Larger Themes**: The storyline delves into the ethical debates of exploration versus exploitation. It challenges the colonists (and readers) to ponder humanity's role in the universe upon confirming they are not alone. Moreover, it introduces potential risks of interacting with alien ecosystems, including unforeseen defensive mechanisms that may require an urgent rethink of Mars exploration strategies.\\n\\nIn conclusion, this science fiction tale weaves together cutting-edge technological exploration with deeply humanistic themes, ensuring the reader is captivated by the wonders and existential queries of expanding human presence beyond Earth.\\n\\n【Design the main characters and their relationships within the colony, including their roles, motivations, and conflicts.】:\\n ### Main Characters and Their Relationships within the Mars Colony\\n\\n**1.

For example, provide more detailed requirements based on design conclusions, or remove redundant content in the already-written novel.\\n\\n2. **Atomic Writing Task Determination**: Within the context of the overall plan and the already-written novel, evaluate whether the given writing task is an atomic task, meaning it does not require further planning. According to narrative theory and the organization of story writing, a writing task can be further broken down into more granular writing sub-tasks and design sub-tasks.

The Martian dust was their constant enemy, finding ways to infiltrate even their most sophisticated systems.\\n\\nThree levels below, Dr. Sarah Patel hunched over her workstation in the primary lab, her young face illuminated by streams of data. She barely noticed Dr. Yuki Tanaka entering until a steaming cup appeared beside her tablet.\\n\\n\\\"You've been here since third shift,\\\" Yuki observed, her voice carrying both concern and mild reproach. \\\"The samples aren't going anywhere.\\\"\\n\\nSarah's eyes remained fixed on the screen. \\\"These mineral formations don't match anything in our database.

Major Marcus Williams filled the frame, his security uniform pristine despite the early hour. \\\"And unauthorized all-nighters violate protocol, Dr. Patel.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Marcus,\\\" Sarah straightened, her cheeks flushing slightly. \\\"I filed the extension request with Dr. Rodriguez.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Which I approved,\\\" Elena's voice cut through the comm system. \\\"But he's right about the hours, Sarah. We need everyone at their best. The discovery team meets at 0900.\\\"\\n\\nIn the hydroponics bay, Dr. James Chen methodically checked the nutrient levels of their precious food supply. The gentle hum of circulation pumps provided a soothing backdrop to his morning routine. A flash of movement caught his eye – Dr. Aisha Hassan was leading her morning meditation group in the adjacent recreational space.\\n\\n\\\"James,\\\" Aisha called out as her session ended. \\\"Join us tomorrow? Your cortisol levels were elevated in yesterday's scan.\\\"\\n\\nChen managed a small smile. \\\"Some of us prefer engineering problems to mindfulness, Doctor.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And some of us prefer our chief engineer not burning out,\\\" she countered, her dark eyes twinkling. \\\"Especially with what Elena's team found in those lava tubes.\\\"\\n\\nThe mention of the discovery sent a familiar ripple of unease through Chen. He'd spent fifteen years making Hub One a marvel of sustainable engineering, a delicate balance of systems and failsafes. Now this finding threatened to upend everything.\\n\\nIn the main corridor, Elena encountered Yuki heading toward the environmental control center. \\\"Dr. Tanaka, walk with me? We need to discuss the impact assessments for expanded underground operations.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I've prepared a preliminary report,\\\" Yuki fell into step beside her director. \\\"But I have concerns about disturbing the subsurface ecosystem. If those bioluminescent organisms are indeed a distinct lifeform—\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's why we need your expertise,\\\" Elena interrupted as they entered the bustling command center. \\\"We're not here to conquer Mars, but we can't ignore what might be the greatest scientific discovery in human history.\\\"\\n\\nThe morning briefing would start soon. Through the dome above, the Martian sun climbed higher, bathing Hub One's inhabitants in its distant light. Another day on Mars began, but beneath their feet, ancient secrets waited to change everything they thought they knew about life in the universe.\\n\\nMajor Williams did a final security sweep, his trained eyes noting Dr. Patel finally leaving her lab, Dr. Hassan gathering her meditation supplies, and Dr. Chen's maintenance bots scurrying through the ventilation system. Everything normal, everything routine. But like everyone else in Hub One, he couldn't shake the feeling that normal and routine were about to become relics of the past.\\n\\nThe Modified Martian Crawler (MC-4) hummed to life as Dr. Chen initiated the descent sequence. Through the reinforced viewport, Sarah watched the entry chamber's walls glisten under the LED arrays, her fingers drumming impatiently against the console.\\n\\n\\\"Atmospheric seals confirmed,\\\" Williams announced, his voice steady. \\\"Beginning initial approach.\\\"\\n\\nThe MC-4 eased down the natural fissure, its titanium tracks gripping the basaltic surface. Elena monitored the real-time LIDAR mapping, while Yuki called out environmental readings.\\n\\n\\\"Fifteen meters,\\\" Chen reported. \\\"Dust filtration at optimal levels. Beginning primary descent.\\\"\\n\\nThe tunnel narrowed as they passed the twenty-meter mark, the crawler's floodlights catching glints of iron oxide in the rock walls. Sarah leaned forward, adjusting her spectral analyzer. \\\"Temperature's rising – point-two degrees above predicted models.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Maintain descent speed,\\\" Williams cautioned as the gradient steepened to twenty-two degrees. \\\"Those structural integrity readings—\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Are well within safety parameters,\\\" Sarah interjected, earning a sharp look from Elena.\\n\\nAt forty-five meters, the tunnel opened into the critical junction. Bioluminescent specs dotted the cavern walls, casting an ethereal blue glow. The team fell silent, watching the ghostly light dance across their instruments.\\n\\n\\\"Electromagnetic interference increasing,\\\" Chen noted, his fingers flying across the controls. \\\"Humidity at forty-two percent and climbing.\\\"\\n\\nThe final approach brought new wonders. Geometric patterns emerged in the mineral formations, their symmetry too perfect to be natural. Sarah's breath caught as the crawler's sensors mapped the main chamber ahead.\\n\\n\\\"Sixty-seven meters,\\\" Elena announced, her professional demeanor cracking slightly. \\\"We've arrived.\\\"\\n\\nThe chamber spread before them, a cathedral of crystalline formations and threading water channels. Microbial mats glowed with an inner light, their patterns pulsing in mysterious synchronicity.\\n\\n\\\"My God,\\\" Yuki whispered, her environmental concerns momentarily forgotten in the face of such beauty.\\n\\nWilliams activated the containment protocols, but his eyes, like everyone else's, were fixed on the impossible scene before them. They had prepared for this moment, but nothing could have truly readied them for what Mars had been hiding.\\n\\nThe crystalline formations towered like frozen waterfalls, their surfaces refracting the crawler's lights into prismatic cascades. Sarah's spectral analyzer whirred continuously as she documented the structures' composition.\\n\\n\\\"These aren't just random mineral deposits,\\\" she breathed, eyes fixed on her readings. \\\"The crystalline matrix shows repeating patterns at both macro and microscopic levels. Look at this lattice structure—it's almost like a circuit board.\\\"\\n\\nElena moved to the water channels that carved through the chamber floor, their surfaces rippling with an inner luminescence. \\\"Dr. Tanaka, are you seeing this? The water's flowing against gravitational predictions.\\\"\\n\\nYuki's environmental sensors painted streams of data across her tablet. \\\"Water composition shows unprecedented mineral saturation. Heavy metals, rare earth elements, and—\\\" she paused, rechecking her readings, \\\"—organic compounds I can't even classify.\\\"\\n\\nThe bioluminescent mats pulsed in waves of azure and violet, their rhythm echoing through the chamber like a silent heartbeat. Chen's electromagnetic sensors suddenly spiked, their displays flashing warning signals.\\n\\n\\\"Regular pulses, matching the bioluminescent frequencies,\\\" he reported, his usual caution giving way to wonder. \\\"Each pulse carries a distinct electromagnetic signature. There's a pattern here, almost like—\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Communication,\\\" Sarah finished, her hands trembling as she calibrated her microscanner. \\\"I'm detecting at least five distinct microbial species, each with unique bioelectric signatures. They're responding to each other, creating these synchronized waves.\\\"\\n\\nWilliams monitored the atmospheric readings, his security training warring with his amazement. \\\"Temperature holding at twelve degrees Celsius, well above surface norms. Atmospheric pressure increasing slightly with each pulse. The whole chamber seems to be breathing.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The geometric patterns in the rock face,\\\" Elena directed their attention to the walls, where crystalline formations traced perfect hexagons and spirals. \\\"They're not just surface features. Ground-penetrating radar shows they extend meters into the rock, forming three-dimensional structures too precise for natural formation.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And look at this,\\\" Yuki called out, her sensor probe hovering over one of the water channels. \\\"The microbial mats aren't just surviving—they're actively processing these minerals, creating complex organic molecules unlike anything in our databases. This isn't just life, it's an entire ecosystem we never imagined possible.\\\"\\n\\nThe team worked in focused silence, each discovery adding to the overwhelming reality of what they'd found. Mars hadn't just harbored life—it had nurtured it into something beyond their comprehension, hidden safely beneath the red planet's surface for countless millennia.\\n\\n\\\"Initiate full containment protocols,\\\" Elena commanded, her voice steady despite the tremor in her hands. \\\"Dr. Patel, preliminary samples only—through the remote collection system.\\\"\\n\\nSarah's fingers flew across her console, barely containing her excitement. \\\"But Director, if we could just—\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Through the remote system,\\\" Williams interjected, positioning himself between Sarah and the chamber's edge. \\\"These electromagnetic pulses could indicate defensive capabilities we don't understand.\\\"\\n\\nYuki's environmental sensors chirped in alarm. \\\"The microbial response to our presence is accelerating.

Include colony structure, environmental challenges, and the scientific/technological implications of the discovery.】:\\n ### Mars Colony Setting and Nature of Discovery\\n\\n**1. Mars Colony Structure and Environment**\\n\\n- **Hub One**: The central and primary structure of the Mars colony, designed to accommodate up to 150 residents. It features a dome-shaped architecture with three interconnected levels—providing living quarters, advanced research facilities, and essential utilities. The dome is made from reinforced composite materials offering ample radiation protection, and access is managed via a robust double-airlock system to maintain atmospheric stability. Below the surface, tunnels extend 30 meters, housing emergency living quarters, additional storage, and back-up life support systems.\\n\\n- **Environmental and Operational Challenges**: The colony operates in a resource-scarce environment, managing limited water supply through precise rationing and advanced reclamation technologies. Dust infiltration requires continuous filtration efforts, and psychological stress from confinement and isolation is mitigated with technology-assisted health assessments and communal activities. Automation systems aid in environmental management, emergency responses, and efficient scheduling, crucial during severe dust storms or power outages.\\n\\n**2. The Underground Discovery**\\n\\n- **Nature and Location**: The discovery lies 67 meters beneath the surface, within a labyrinth of ancient lava tubes 180 meters southeast of Hub One. Explorations revealed preserved ecosystems resembling microbial mats trapped within crystalline formations. A parallel network of high-pressure water channels remains unfrozen due to unique mineral compositions and geothermal influences, with faint bioluminescent microbes hinting at ongoing subterranean life.\\n\\n- **Technological Element**: Within the chamber, mineral formations exhibit unexplained geometric patterns, emitting unusual electromagnetic readings that suggest past technological interventions or natural phenomena yet to be deciphered.\\n\\n**3. Scientific and Technological Implications**\\n\\n- **Implications for Science**: This marks the pivotal evidence of an extraterrestrial biosphere, challenging previous scientific assumptions about life. It provides crucial insights into Mars' climatic and geological history and fuels prospects for biotechnological advancements on Earth.\\n\\n- **Investigation Framework**: A research team is assembled, equipped with advanced technology such as portable spectrometers, 3D mapping tools, and robotic explorers for careful analysis. The focus lies in containment and safe exploration, with biohazard protocols ensuring no cross-contamination between Mars and Earth-bound elements.\\n\\n- **Colony Impact and Expanded Vision**: The discovery catalyzes plans for expanded underground facilities, influencing future colonization patterns and emphasizing an ethical approach to interplanetary interactions.\\n\\n**4. Thematic and Ethical Considerations**\\n\\n- **Larger Themes**: The storyline delves into the ethical debates of exploration versus exploitation. It challenges the colonists (and readers) to ponder humanity's role in the universe upon confirming they are not alone. Moreover, it introduces potential risks of interacting with alien ecosystems, including unforeseen defensive mechanisms that may require an urgent rethink of Mars exploration strategies.\\n\\nIn conclusion, this science fiction tale weaves together cutting-edge technological exploration with deeply humanistic themes, ensuring the reader is captivated by the wonders and existential queries of expanding human presence beyond Earth.\\n\\n【Design the main characters and their relationships within the colony, including their roles, motivations, and conflicts.】:\\n ### Main Characters and Their Relationships within the Mars Colony\\n\\n**1.

Dr. Elena Rodriguez stood at her usual spot in the observation deck, her dark eyes scanning both the external sensors and the internal monitoring systems that kept their artificial ecosystem in perfect balance.\\n\\n\\\"Morning status report, Dr. Chen?\\\" she spoke into her comm unit, her fingers dancing across the holographic display.\\n\\nA slight crackle preceded the chief engineer's response. \\\"All systems nominal, Elena. Though the dust filtration units in Section C are operating at eighty-seven percent efficiency. I've got the maintenance bots on it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Again?\\\" Elena sighed, making a mental note to review the filtration designs. The Martian dust was their constant enemy, finding ways to infiltrate even their most sophisticated systems.\\n\\nThree levels below, Dr. Sarah Patel hunched over her workstation in the primary lab, her young face illuminated by streams of data. She barely noticed Dr. Yuki Tanaka entering until a steaming cup appeared beside her tablet.\\n\\n\\\"You've been here since third shift,\\\" Yuki observed, her voice carrying both concern and mild reproach. \\\"The samples aren't going anywhere.\\\"\\n\\nSarah's eyes remained fixed on the screen. \\\"These mineral formations don't match anything in our database. The crystalline structure is... almost engineered.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Almost isn't science,\\\" came a deep voice from the doorway. Major Marcus Williams filled the frame, his security uniform pristine despite the early hour. \\\"And unauthorized all-nighters violate protocol, Dr. Patel.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Marcus,\\\" Sarah straightened, her cheeks flushing slightly. \\\"I filed the extension request with Dr. Rodriguez.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Which I approved,\\\" Elena's voice cut through the comm system. \\\"But he's right about the hours, Sarah. We need everyone at their best. The discovery team meets at 0900.\\\"\\n\\nIn the hydroponics bay, Dr. James Chen methodically checked the nutrient levels of their precious food supply. The gentle hum of circulation pumps provided a soothing backdrop to his morning routine. A flash of movement caught his eye – Dr. Aisha Hassan was leading her morning meditation group in the adjacent recreational space.\\n\\n\\\"James,\\\" Aisha called out as her session ended. \\\"Join us tomorrow? Your cortisol levels were elevated in yesterday's scan.\\\"\\n\\nChen managed a small smile. \\\"Some of us prefer engineering problems to mindfulness, Doctor.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And some of us prefer our chief engineer not burning out,\\\" she countered, her dark eyes twinkling. \\\"Especially with what Elena's team found in those lava tubes.\\\"\\n\\nThe mention of the discovery sent a familiar ripple of unease through Chen. He'd spent fifteen years making Hub One a marvel of sustainable engineering, a delicate balance of systems and failsafes. Now this finding threatened to upend everything.\\n\\nIn the main corridor, Elena encountered Yuki heading toward the environmental control center. \\\"Dr. Tanaka, walk with me? We need to discuss the impact assessments for expanded underground operations.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I've prepared a preliminary report,\\\" Yuki fell into step beside her director. \\\"But I have concerns about disturbing the subsurface ecosystem. If those bioluminescent organisms are indeed a distinct lifeform—\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's why we need your expertise,\\\" Elena interrupted as they entered the bustling command center. \\\"We're not here to conquer Mars, but we can't ignore what might be the greatest scientific discovery in human history.\\\"\\n\\nThe morning briefing would start soon. Through the dome above, the Martian sun climbed higher, bathing Hub One's inhabitants in its distant light. Another day on Mars began, but beneath their feet, ancient secrets waited to change everything they thought they knew about life in the universe.\\n\\nMajor Williams did a final security sweep, his trained eyes noting Dr. Patel finally leaving her lab, Dr. Hassan gathering her meditation supplies, and Dr. Chen's maintenance bots scurrying through the ventilation system. Everything normal, everything routine. But like everyone else in Hub One, he couldn't shake the feeling that normal and routine were about to become relics of the past.\\n\\nThe Modified Martian Crawler (MC-4) hummed to life as Dr. Chen initiated the descent sequence. Through the reinforced viewport, Sarah watched the entry chamber's walls glisten under the LED arrays, her fingers drumming impatiently against the console.\\n\\n\\\"Atmospheric seals confirmed,\\\" Williams announced, his voice steady. \\\"Beginning initial approach.\\\"\\n\\nThe MC-4 eased down the natural fissure, its titanium tracks gripping the basaltic surface. Elena monitored the real-time LIDAR mapping, while Yuki called out environmental readings.\\n\\n\\\"Fifteen meters,\\\" Chen reported. \\\"Dust filtration at optimal levels. Beginning primary descent.\\\"\\n\\nThe tunnel narrowed as they passed the twenty-meter mark, the crawler's floodlights catching glints of iron oxide in the rock walls. Sarah leaned forward, adjusting her spectral analyzer. \\\"Temperature's rising – point-two degrees above predicted models.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Maintain descent speed,\\\" Williams cautioned as the gradient steepened to twenty-two degrees. \\\"Those structural integrity readings—\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Are well within safety parameters,\\\" Sarah interjected, earning a sharp look from Elena.\\n\\nAt forty-five meters, the tunnel opened into the critical junction. Bioluminescent specs dotted the cavern walls, casting an ethereal blue glow. The team fell silent, watching the ghostly light dance across their instruments.\\n\\n\\\"Electromagnetic interference increasing,\\\" Chen noted, his fingers flying across the controls. \\\"Humidity at forty-two percent and climbing.\\\"\\n\\nThe final approach brought new wonders. Geometric patterns emerged in the mineral formations, their symmetry too perfect to be natural. Sarah's breath caught as the crawler's sensors mapped the main chamber ahead.\\n\\n\\\"Sixty-seven meters,\\\" Elena announced, her professional demeanor cracking slightly. \\\"We've arrived.\\\"\\n\\nThe chamber spread before them, a cathedral of crystalline formations and threading water channels. Microbial mats glowed with an inner light, their patterns pulsing in mysterious synchronicity.\\n\\n\\\"My God,\\\" Yuki whispered, her environmental concerns momentarily forgotten in the face of such beauty.\\n\\nWilliams activated the containment protocols, but his eyes, like everyone else's, were fixed on the impossible scene before them. They had prepared for this moment, but nothing could have truly readied them for what Mars had been hiding.\\n\\nThe crystalline formations towered like frozen waterfalls, their surfaces refracting the crawler's lights into prismatic cascades. Sarah's spectral analyzer whirred continuously as she documented the structures' composition.\\n\\n\\\"These aren't just random mineral deposits,\\\" she breathed, eyes fixed on her readings. \\\"The crystalline matrix shows repeating patterns at both macro and microscopic levels. Look at this lattice structure—it's almost like a circuit board.\\\"\\n\\nElena moved to the water channels that carved through the chamber floor, their surfaces rippling with an inner luminescence. \\\"Dr. Tanaka, are you seeing this? The water's flowing against gravitational predictions.\\\"\\n\\nYuki's environmental sensors painted streams of data across her tablet. \\\"Water composition shows unprecedented mineral saturation. Heavy metals, rare earth elements, and—\\\" she paused, rechecking her readings, \\\"—organic compounds I can't even classify.\\\"\\n\\nThe bioluminescent mats pulsed in waves of azure and violet, their rhythm echoing through the chamber like a silent heartbeat. Chen's electromagnetic sensors suddenly spiked, their displays flashing warning signals.\\n\\n\\\"Regular pulses, matching the bioluminescent frequencies,\\\" he reported, his usual caution giving way to wonder. \\\"Each pulse carries a distinct electromagnetic signature. There's a pattern here, almost like—\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Communication,\\\" Sarah finished, her hands trembling as she calibrated her microscanner. \\\"I'm detecting at least five distinct microbial species, each with unique bioelectric signatures. They're responding to each other, creating these synchronized waves.\\\"\\n\\nWilliams monitored the atmospheric readings, his security training warring with his amazement. \\\"Temperature holding at twelve degrees Celsius, well above surface norms. Atmospheric pressure increasing slightly with each pulse. The whole chamber seems to be breathing.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The geometric patterns in the rock face,\\\" Elena directed their attention to the walls, where crystalline formations traced perfect hexagons and spirals. \\\"They're not just surface features. Ground-penetrating radar shows they extend meters into the rock, forming three-dimensional structures too precise for natural formation.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And look at this,\\\" Yuki called out, her sensor probe hovering over one of the water channels. \\\"The microbial mats aren't just surviving—they're actively processing these minerals, creating complex organic molecules unlike anything in our databases. This isn't just life, it's an entire ecosystem we never imagined possible.\\\"\\n\\nThe team worked in focused silence, each discovery adding to the overwhelming reality of what they'd found. Mars hadn't just harbored life—it had nurtured it into something beyond their comprehension, hidden safely beneath the red planet's surface for countless millennia.\\n\\n\\\"Initiate full containment protocols,\\\" Elena commanded, her voice steady despite the tremor in her hands. \\\"Dr. Patel, preliminary samples only—through the remote collection system.\\\"\\n\\nSarah's fingers flew across her console, barely containing her excitement. \\\"But Director, if we could just—\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Through the remote system,\\\" Williams interjected, positioning himself between Sarah and the chamber's edge. \\\"These electromagnetic pulses could indicate defensive capabilities we don't understand.\\\"\\n\\nYuki's environmental sensors chirped in alarm. \\\"The microbial response to our presence is accelerating.

Dr. Elena Rodriguez stood at her usual spot in the observation deck, her dark eyes scanning both the external sensors and the internal monitoring systems that kept their artificial ecosystem in perfect balance.\\n\\n\\\"Morning status report, Dr. Chen?\\\" she spoke into her comm unit, her fingers dancing across the holographic display.\\n\\nA slight crackle preceded the chief engineer's response. \\\"All systems nominal, Elena. Though the dust filtration units in Section C are operating at eighty-seven percent efficiency. I've got the maintenance bots on it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Again?\\\" Elena sighed, making a mental note to review the filtration designs. The Martian dust was their constant enemy, finding ways to infiltrate even their most sophisticated systems.\\n\\nThree levels below, Dr. Sarah Patel hunched over her workstation in the primary lab, her young face illuminated by streams of data. She barely noticed Dr. Yuki Tanaka entering until a steaming cup appeared beside her tablet.\\n\\n\\\"You've been here since third shift,\\\" Yuki observed, her voice carrying both concern and mild reproach. \\\"The samples aren't going anywhere.\\\"\\n\\nSarah's eyes remained fixed on the screen. \\\"These mineral formations don't match anything in our database. The crystalline structure is... almost engineered.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Almost isn't science,\\\" came a deep voice from the doorway. Major Marcus Williams filled the frame, his security uniform pristine despite the early hour. \\\"And unauthorized all-nighters violate protocol, Dr. Patel.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Marcus,\\\" Sarah straightened, her cheeks flushing slightly. \\\"I filed the extension request with Dr. Rodriguez.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Which I approved,\\\" Elena's voice cut through the comm system. \\\"But he's right about the hours, Sarah. We need everyone at their best. The discovery team meets at 0900.\\\"\\n\\nIn the hydroponics bay, Dr. James Chen methodically checked the nutrient levels of their precious food supply. The gentle hum of circulation pumps provided a soothing backdrop to his morning routine. A flash of movement caught his eye – Dr. Aisha Hassan was leading her morning meditation group in the adjacent recreational space.\\n\\n\\\"James,\\\" Aisha called out as her session ended. \\\"Join us tomorrow? Your cortisol levels were elevated in yesterday's scan.\\\"\\n\\nChen managed a small smile. \\\"Some of us prefer engineering problems to mindfulness, Doctor.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And some of us prefer our chief engineer not burning out,\\\" she countered, her dark eyes twinkling. \\\"Especially with what Elena's team found in those lava tubes.\\\"\\n\\nThe mention of the discovery sent a familiar ripple of unease through Chen. He'd spent fifteen years making Hub One a marvel of sustainable engineering, a delicate balance of systems and failsafes. Now this finding threatened to upend everything.\\n\\nIn the main corridor, Elena encountered Yuki heading toward the environmental control center. \\\"Dr. Tanaka, walk with me? We need to discuss the impact assessments for expanded underground operations.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I've prepared a preliminary report,\\\" Yuki fell into step beside her director. \\\"But I have concerns about disturbing the subsurface ecosystem. If those bioluminescent organisms are indeed a distinct lifeform—\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's why we need your expertise,\\\" Elena interrupted as they entered the bustling command center. \\\"We're not here to conquer Mars, but we can't ignore what might be the greatest scientific discovery in human history.\\\"\\n\\nThe morning briefing would start soon. Through the dome above, the Martian sun climbed higher, bathing Hub One's inhabitants in its distant light. Another day on Mars began, but beneath their feet, ancient secrets waited to change everything they thought they knew about life in the universe.\\n\\nMajor Williams did a final security sweep, his trained eyes noting Dr. Patel finally leaving her lab, Dr. Hassan gathering her meditation supplies, and Dr. Chen's maintenance bots scurrying through the ventilation system. Everything normal, everything routine. But like everyone else in Hub One, he couldn't shake the feeling that normal and routine were about to become relics of the past.\\n\\nThe Modified Martian Crawler (MC-4) hummed to life as Dr. Chen initiated the descent sequence. Through the reinforced viewport, Sarah watched the entry chamber's walls glisten under the LED arrays, her fingers drumming impatiently against the console.\\n\\n\\\"Atmospheric seals confirmed,\\\" Williams announced, his voice steady. \\\"Beginning initial approach.\\\"\\n\\nThe MC-4 eased down the natural fissure, its titanium tracks gripping the basaltic surface. Elena monitored the real-time LIDAR mapping, while Yuki called out environmental readings.\\n\\n\\\"Fifteen meters,\\\" Chen reported. \\\"Dust filtration at optimal levels. Beginning primary descent.\\\"\\n\\nThe tunnel narrowed as they passed the twenty-meter mark, the crawler's floodlights catching glints of iron oxide in the rock walls. Sarah leaned forward, adjusting her spectral analyzer. \\\"Temperature's rising – point-two degrees above predicted models.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Maintain descent speed,\\\" Williams cautioned as the gradient steepened to twenty-two degrees. \\\"Those structural integrity readings—\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Are well within safety parameters,\\\" Sarah interjected, earning a sharp look from Elena.\\n\\nAt forty-five meters, the tunnel opened into the critical junction. Bioluminescent specs dotted the cavern walls, casting an ethereal blue glow. The team fell silent, watching the ghostly light dance across their instruments.\\n\\n\\\"Electromagnetic interference increasing,\\\" Chen noted, his fingers flying across the controls. \\\"Humidity at forty-two percent and climbing.\\\"\\n\\nThe final approach brought new wonders. Geometric patterns emerged in the mineral formations, their symmetry too perfect to be natural. Sarah's breath caught as the crawler's sensors mapped the main chamber ahead.\\n\\n\\\"Sixty-seven meters,\\\" Elena announced, her professional demeanor cracking slightly. \\\"We've arrived.\\\"\\n\\nThe chamber spread before them, a cathedral of crystalline formations and threading water channels. Microbial mats glowed with an inner light, their patterns pulsing in mysterious synchronicity.\\n\\n\\\"My God,\\\" Yuki whispered, her environmental concerns momentarily forgotten in the face of such beauty.\\n\\nWilliams activated the containment protocols, but his eyes, like everyone else's, were fixed on the impossible scene before them. They had prepared for this moment, but nothing could have truly readied them for what Mars had been hiding.\\n\\nThe crystalline formations towered like frozen waterfalls, their surfaces refracting the crawler's lights into prismatic cascades. Sarah's spectral analyzer whirred continuously as she documented the structures' composition.\\n\\n\\\"These aren't just random mineral deposits,\\\" she breathed, eyes fixed on her readings. \\\"The crystalline matrix shows repeating patterns at both macro and microscopic levels. Look at this lattice structure—it's almost like a circuit board.\\\"\\n\\nElena moved to the water channels that carved through the chamber floor, their surfaces rippling with an inner luminescence. \\\"Dr. Tanaka, are you seeing this? The water's flowing against gravitational predictions.\\\"\\n\\nYuki's environmental sensors painted streams of data across her tablet. \\\"Water composition shows unprecedented mineral saturation. Heavy metals, rare earth elements, and—\\\" she paused, rechecking her readings, \\\"—organic compounds I can't even classify.\\\"\\n\\nThe bioluminescent mats pulsed in waves of azure and violet, their rhythm echoing through the chamber like a silent heartbeat. Chen's electromagnetic sensors suddenly spiked, their displays flashing warning signals.\\n\\n\\\"Regular pulses, matching the bioluminescent frequencies,\\\" he reported, his usual caution giving way to wonder. \\\"Each pulse carries a distinct electromagnetic signature. There's a pattern here, almost like—\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Communication,\\\" Sarah finished, her hands trembling as she calibrated her microscanner. \\\"I'm detecting at least five distinct microbial species, each with unique bioelectric signatures. They're responding to each other, creating these synchronized waves.\\\"\\n\\nWilliams monitored the atmospheric readings, his security training warring with his amazement. \\\"Temperature holding at twelve degrees Celsius, well above surface norms. Atmospheric pressure increasing slightly with each pulse. The whole chamber seems to be breathing.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The geometric patterns in the rock face,\\\" Elena directed their attention to the walls, where crystalline formations traced perfect hexagons and spirals. \\\"They're not just surface features. Ground-penetrating radar shows they extend meters into the rock, forming three-dimensional structures too precise for natural formation.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And look at this,\\\" Yuki called out, her sensor probe hovering over one of the water channels. \\\"The microbial mats aren't just surviving—they're actively processing these minerals, creating complex organic molecules unlike anything in our databases. This isn't just life, it's an entire ecosystem we never imagined possible.\\\"\\n\\nThe team worked in focused silence, each discovery adding to the overwhelming reality of what they'd found. Mars hadn't just harbored life—it had nurtured it into something beyond their comprehension, hidden safely beneath the red planet's surface for countless millennia.\\n\\n\\\"Initiate full containment protocols,\\\" Elena commanded, her voice steady despite the tremor in her hands. \\\"Dr. Patel, preliminary samples only—through the remote collection system.\\\"\\n\\nSarah's fingers flew across her console, barely containing her excitement. \\\"But Director, if we could just—\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Through the remote system,\\\" Williams interjected, positioning himself between Sarah and the chamber's edge. \\\"These electromagnetic pulses could indicate defensive capabilities we don't understand.\\\"\\n\\nYuki's environmental sensors chirped in alarm. \\\"The microbial response to our presence is accelerating.

We're acknowledging that we've stumbled into something far beyond our current understanding. This isn't our technology to command or our ecosystem to control.\"\n\n\"So what do we do?\" Sarah whispered, her earlier defiance melting into something closer to reverence.\n\n\"We learn to listen,\" Yuki suggested, sharing a meaningful look with Elena. \"Establish long-term observation protocols.

Dr. Elena Rodriguez stood at her usual spot in the observation deck, her dark eyes scanning both the external sensors and the internal monitoring systems that kept their artificial ecosystem in perfect balance.\\n\\n\\\"Morning status report, Dr. Chen?\\\" she spoke into her comm unit, her fingers dancing across the holographic display.\\n\\nA slight crackle preceded the chief engineer's response. \\\"All systems nominal, Elena. Though the dust filtration units in Section C are operating at eighty-seven percent efficiency. I've got the maintenance bots on it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Again?\\\" Elena sighed, making a mental note to review the filtration designs. The Martian dust was their constant enemy, finding ways to infiltrate even their most sophisticated systems.\\n\\nThree levels below, Dr. Sarah Patel hunched over her workstation in the primary lab, her young face illuminated by streams of data. She barely noticed Dr. Yuki Tanaka entering until a steaming cup appeared beside her tablet.\\n\\n\\\"You've been here since third shift,\\\" Yuki observed, her voice carrying both concern and mild reproach. \\\"The samples aren't going anywhere.\\\"\\n\\nSarah's eyes remained fixed on the screen. \\\"These mineral formations don't match anything in our database. The crystalline structure is... almost engineered.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Almost isn't science,\\\" came a deep voice from the doorway. Major Marcus Williams filled the frame, his security uniform pristine despite the early hour. \\\"And unauthorized all-nighters violate protocol, Dr. Patel.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Marcus,\\\" Sarah straightened, her cheeks flushing slightly. \\\"I filed the extension request with Dr. Rodriguez.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Which I approved,\\\" Elena's voice cut through the comm system. \\\"But he's right about the hours, Sarah. We need everyone at their best. The discovery team meets at 0900.\\\"\\n\\nIn the hydroponics bay, Dr. James Chen methodically checked the nutrient levels of their precious food supply. The gentle hum of circulation pumps provided a soothing backdrop to his morning routine. A flash of movement caught his eye – Dr. Aisha Hassan was leading her morning meditation group in the adjacent recreational space.\\n\\n\\\"James,\\\" Aisha called out as her session ended. \\\"Join us tomorrow? Your cortisol levels were elevated in yesterday's scan.\\\"\\n\\nChen managed a small smile. \\\"Some of us prefer engineering problems to mindfulness, Doctor.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And some of us prefer our chief engineer not burning out,\\\" she countered, her dark eyes twinkling. \\\"Especially with what Elena's team found in those lava tubes.\\\"\\n\\nThe mention of the discovery sent a familiar ripple of unease through Chen. He'd spent fifteen years making Hub One a marvel of sustainable engineering, a delicate balance of systems and failsafes. Now this finding threatened to upend everything.\\n\\nIn the main corridor, Elena encountered Yuki heading toward the environmental control center. \\\"Dr. Tanaka, walk with me? We need to discuss the impact assessments for expanded underground operations.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I've prepared a preliminary report,\\\" Yuki fell into step beside her director. \\\"But I have concerns about disturbing the subsurface ecosystem. If those bioluminescent organisms are indeed a distinct lifeform—\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's why we need your expertise,\\\" Elena interrupted as they entered the bustling command center. \\\"We're not here to conquer Mars, but we can't ignore what might be the greatest scientific discovery in human history.\\\"\\n\\nThe morning briefing would start soon. Through the dome above, the Martian sun climbed higher, bathing Hub One's inhabitants in its distant light. Another day on Mars began, but beneath their feet, ancient secrets waited to change everything they thought they knew about life in the universe.\\n\\nMajor Williams did a final security sweep, his trained eyes noting Dr. Patel finally leaving her lab, Dr. Hassan gathering her meditation supplies, and Dr. Chen's maintenance bots scurrying through the ventilation system. Everything normal, everything routine. But like everyone else in Hub One, he couldn't shake the feeling that normal and routine were about to become relics of the past.\\n\\nThe Modified Martian Crawler (MC-4) hummed to life as Dr. Chen initiated the descent sequence. Through the reinforced viewport, Sarah watched the entry chamber's walls glisten under the LED arrays, her fingers drumming impatiently against the console.\\n\\n\\\"Atmospheric seals confirmed,\\\" Williams announced, his voice steady. \\\"Beginning initial approach.\\\"\\n\\nThe MC-4 eased down the natural fissure, its titanium tracks gripping the basaltic surface. Elena monitored the real-time LIDAR mapping, while Yuki called out environmental readings.\\n\\n\\\"Fifteen meters,\\\" Chen reported. \\\"Dust filtration at optimal levels. Beginning primary descent.\\\"\\n\\nThe tunnel narrowed as they passed the twenty-meter mark, the crawler's floodlights catching glints of iron oxide in the rock walls. Sarah leaned forward, adjusting her spectral analyzer. \\\"Temperature's rising – point-two degrees above predicted models.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Maintain descent speed,\\\" Williams cautioned as the gradient steepened to twenty-two degrees. \\\"Those structural integrity readings—\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Are well within safety parameters,\\\" Sarah interjected, earning a sharp look from Elena.\\n\\nAt forty-five meters, the tunnel opened into the critical junction. Bioluminescent specs dotted the cavern walls, casting an ethereal blue glow. The team fell silent, watching the ghostly light dance across their instruments.\\n\\n\\\"Electromagnetic interference increasing,\\\" Chen noted, his fingers flying across the controls. \\\"Humidity at forty-two percent and climbing.\\\"\\n\\nThe final approach brought new wonders. Geometric patterns emerged in the mineral formations, their symmetry too perfect to be natural. Sarah's breath caught as the crawler's sensors mapped the main chamber ahead.\\n\\n\\\"Sixty-seven meters,\\\" Elena announced, her professional demeanor cracking slightly. \\\"We've arrived.\\\"\\n\\nThe chamber spread before them, a cathedral of crystalline formations and threading water channels. Microbial mats glowed with an inner light, their patterns pulsing in mysterious synchronicity.\\n\\n\\\"My God,\\\" Yuki whispered, her environmental concerns momentarily forgotten in the face of such beauty.\\n\\nWilliams activated the containment protocols, but his eyes, like everyone else's, were fixed on the impossible scene before them. They had prepared for this moment, but nothing could have truly readied them for what Mars had been hiding.\\n\\nThe crystalline formations towered like frozen waterfalls, their surfaces refracting the crawler's lights into prismatic cascades. Sarah's spectral analyzer whirred continuously as she documented the structures' composition.\\n\\n\\\"These aren't just random mineral deposits,\\\" she breathed, eyes fixed on her readings. \\\"The crystalline matrix shows repeating patterns at both macro and microscopic levels. Look at this lattice structure—it's almost like a circuit board.\\\"\\n\\nElena moved to the water channels that carved through the chamber floor, their surfaces rippling with an inner luminescence. \\\"Dr. Tanaka, are you seeing this? The water's flowing against gravitational predictions.\\\"\\n\\nYuki's environmental sensors painted streams of data across her tablet. \\\"Water composition shows unprecedented mineral saturation. Heavy metals, rare earth elements, and—\\\" she paused, rechecking her readings, \\\"—organic compounds I can't even classify.\\\"\\n\\nThe bioluminescent mats pulsed in waves of azure and violet, their rhythm echoing through the chamber like a silent heartbeat. Chen's electromagnetic sensors suddenly spiked, their displays flashing warning signals.\\n\\n\\\"Regular pulses, matching the bioluminescent frequencies,\\\" he reported, his usual caution giving way to wonder. \\\"Each pulse carries a distinct electromagnetic signature. There's a pattern here, almost like—\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Communication,\\\" Sarah finished, her hands trembling as she calibrated her microscanner. \\\"I'm detecting at least five distinct microbial species, each with unique bioelectric signatures. They're responding to each other, creating these synchronized waves.\\\"\\n\\nWilliams monitored the atmospheric readings, his security training warring with his amazement. \\\"Temperature holding at twelve degrees Celsius, well above surface norms. Atmospheric pressure increasing slightly with each pulse. The whole chamber seems to be breathing.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The geometric patterns in the rock face,\\\" Elena directed their attention to the walls, where crystalline formations traced perfect hexagons and spirals. \\\"They're not just surface features. Ground-penetrating radar shows they extend meters into the rock, forming three-dimensional structures too precise for natural formation.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And look at this,\\\" Yuki called out, her sensor probe hovering over one of the water channels. \\\"The microbial mats aren't just surviving—they're actively processing these minerals, creating complex organic molecules unlike anything in our databases. This isn't just life, it's an entire ecosystem we never imagined possible.\\\"\\n\\nThe team worked in focused silence, each discovery adding to the overwhelming reality of what they'd found. Mars hadn't just harbored life—it had nurtured it into something beyond their comprehension, hidden safely beneath the red planet's surface for countless millennia.\\n\\n\\\"Initiate full containment protocols,\\\" Elena commanded, her voice steady despite the tremor in her hands. \\\"Dr. Patel, preliminary samples only—through the remote collection system.\\\"\\n\\nSarah's fingers flew across her console, barely containing her excitement. \\\"But Director, if we could just—\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Through the remote system,\\\" Williams interjected, positioning himself between Sarah and the chamber's edge. \\\"These electromagnetic pulses could indicate defensive capabilities we don't understand.\\\"\\n\\nYuki's environmental sensors chirped in alarm. \\\"The microbial response to our presence is accelerating.

A high-level plan tailored to the user's novel-writing needs is already in place, and your task is to further recursively plan the specified writing sub-tasks within this framework. Through your planning, the resulting novel will strictly adhere to user requirements and achieve perfection in terms of plot, creativity (ideas, themes, and topics), and development.\\n\\n1. Continue the recursive planning for the specified professional novel-writing sub-tasks. According to narrative theory, the organization of story writing and the result of the design tasks, break the tasks down into more granular writing sub-tasks, specifying their scope and specific writing content.  \\n2. Plan design sub-tasks as needed to assist and support specific writing. Design sub-tasks can include designing core conflicts, character settings, outlines and detailed outlines, key story beats, story backgrounds, plot elements, etc., to support the actual writing.  \\n3. For each task, plan a sub-task DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), where the edges represent dependency relationships between design tasks within the same layer of the DAG. Recursively plan each sub-task until all sub-tasks are atomic tasks.\\n\\n# Task Types\\n## Writing (Core, actual writing)\\n- **Function**: Perform actual novel-writing tasks in sequence according to the plan. Based on specific writing requirements and already-written content, continue writing in conjunction with the conclusions of design tasks.  \\n- **All writing tasks are continuation tasks**: Ensure continuity with the preceding content during planning. Writing tasks should flow smoothly and seamlessly with one another.  \\n- **Breakable tasks**: Writing, Design  \\n- Unless necessary, each writing sub-task should be > 500 words.\\n\\n## Design\\n- **Function**: Analyze and design any novel-writing needs other than actual writing. This includes but is not limited to designing core conflicts, character settings, outlines and detailed outlines, key story beats, story backgrounds, plot elements, etc., to support the actual writing.  \\n- **Breakable tasks**: Design  \\n\\n# Information Provided to You\\n- **`Already-written novel content`**: Content from previous writing tasks that has already been written.  \\n- **`Overall plan`**: The overall writing plan, which specifies the task you need to plan through the `is_current_to_plan_task` key.  \\n- **`Results of design tasks completed in higher-level tasks`**  \\n- **`Results of design tasks dependent on the same-layer DAG tasks`**  \\n- **`Writing tasks that require further planning`**  \\n- **`Reference planning`**: A planning sample is provided, which you may cautiously reference.  \\n\\n# Planning Tips\\n1. The last sub-task derived from a writing task must always be a writing task.  \\n2. Reasonably control the number of sub-tasks in each layer of the DAG, generally 3–5 sub-tasks. If the number of tasks exceeds this, aim to plan recursively.  \\n3. **Design tasks** can serve as **sub-tasks of writing tasks**, and as many design sub-tasks as possible should be generated to enhance the quality of writing.  \\n4. Use `dependency` to list the IDs of design tasks within the same-layer DAG. List all potential dependencies as comprehensively as possible.  \\n5. When a design sub-task involves designing specific writing structures (e.g., plot design), subsequent dependent writing tasks should not be laid out flat but should await recursive planning in subsequent rounds.  \\n6. **Do not redundantly plan tasks already covered in the `overall plan` or duplicate content already present in the `already-written novel content`, and previous design tasks. ** \\n7. Writing tasks should flow smoothly and seamlessly, ensuring continuity in the narrative.\\n8. Following the Results of design tasks\\n\\n# Task Attributes\\n1. **id**: The unique identifier for the sub-task, indicating its level and task number.  \\n2. **goal**: A precise and complete description of the sub-task goal in string format.  \\n3. **dependency**: A list of design task IDs from the same-layer DAG that this task depends on. List all potential dependencies as comprehensively as possible. If there are no dependent sub-tasks, this should be empty.  \\n4. **task_type**: A string indicating the type of task. Writing tasks are labeled as `write`, and design tasks are labeled as `think`.  \\n5. **length**: For writing tasks, this attribute specifies the scope, it is required for writing task. Design tasks do not require this attribute.  \\n6. **sub_tasks**: A JSON list representing the sub-task DAG. Each element in the list is a JSON object representing a task.\\n\\n\\n# Example\\n\\n<example index=1>\\nUser-given writing task:\\n{\\n    \\\"id\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n    \\\"task_type\\\": \\\"write\\\",\\n    \\\"goal\\\": \\\"Create an excellent suspense story set in the colony on Europa (Jupiter’s moon), incorporating the real environmental characteristics of Europa.

Dr. Elena Rodriguez stood at her usual spot in the observation deck, her dark eyes scanning both the external sensors and the internal monitoring systems that kept their artificial ecosystem in perfect balance.\\n\\n\\\"Morning status report, Dr. Chen?\\\" she spoke into her comm unit, her fingers dancing across the holographic display.\\n\\nA slight crackle preceded the chief engineer's response. \\\"All systems nominal, Elena. Though the dust filtration units in Section C are operating at eighty-seven percent efficiency. I've got the maintenance bots on it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Again?\\\" Elena sighed, making a mental note to review the filtration designs. The Martian dust was their constant enemy, finding ways to infiltrate even their most sophisticated systems.\\n\\nThree levels below, Dr. Sarah Patel hunched over her workstation in the primary lab, her young face illuminated by streams of data. She barely noticed Dr. Yuki Tanaka entering until a steaming cup appeared beside her tablet.\\n\\n\\\"You've been here since third shift,\\\" Yuki observed, her voice carrying both concern and mild reproach. \\\"The samples aren't going anywhere.\\\"\\n\\nSarah's eyes remained fixed on the screen. \\\"These mineral formations don't match anything in our database. The crystalline structure is... almost engineered.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Almost isn't science,\\\" came a deep voice from the doorway. Major Marcus Williams filled the frame, his security uniform pristine despite the early hour. \\\"And unauthorized all-nighters violate protocol, Dr. Patel.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Marcus,\\\" Sarah straightened, her cheeks flushing slightly. \\\"I filed the extension request with Dr. Rodriguez.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Which I approved,\\\" Elena's voice cut through the comm system. \\\"But he's right about the hours, Sarah. We need everyone at their best. The discovery team meets at 0900.\\\"\\n\\nIn the hydroponics bay, Dr. James Chen methodically checked the nutrient levels of their precious food supply. The gentle hum of circulation pumps provided a soothing backdrop to his morning routine. A flash of movement caught his eye – Dr. Aisha Hassan was leading her morning meditation group in the adjacent recreational space.\\n\\n\\\"James,\\\" Aisha called out as her session ended. \\\"Join us tomorrow? Your cortisol levels were elevated in yesterday's scan.\\\"\\n\\nChen managed a small smile. \\\"Some of us prefer engineering problems to mindfulness, Doctor.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And some of us prefer our chief engineer not burning out,\\\" she countered, her dark eyes twinkling. \\\"Especially with what Elena's team found in those lava tubes.\\\"\\n\\nThe mention of the discovery sent a familiar ripple of unease through Chen. He'd spent fifteen years making Hub One a marvel of sustainable engineering, a delicate balance of systems and failsafes. Now this finding threatened to upend everything.\\n\\nIn the main corridor, Elena encountered Yuki heading toward the environmental control center. \\\"Dr. Tanaka, walk with me? We need to discuss the impact assessments for expanded underground operations.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I've prepared a preliminary report,\\\" Yuki fell into step beside her director. \\\"But I have concerns about disturbing the subsurface ecosystem. If those bioluminescent organisms are indeed a distinct lifeform—\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's why we need your expertise,\\\" Elena interrupted as they entered the bustling command center. \\\"We're not here to conquer Mars, but we can't ignore what might be the greatest scientific discovery in human history.\\\"\\n\\nThe morning briefing would start soon. Through the dome above, the Martian sun climbed higher, bathing Hub One's inhabitants in its distant light. Another day on Mars began, but beneath their feet, ancient secrets waited to change everything they thought they knew about life in the universe.\\n\\nMajor Williams did a final security sweep, his trained eyes noting Dr. Patel finally leaving her lab, Dr. Hassan gathering her meditation supplies, and Dr. Chen's maintenance bots scurrying through the ventilation system. Everything normal, everything routine. But like everyone else in Hub One, he couldn't shake the feeling that normal and routine were about to become relics of the past.\\n\\nThe Modified Martian Crawler (MC-4) hummed to life as Dr. Chen initiated the descent sequence. Through the reinforced viewport, Sarah watched the entry chamber's walls glisten under the LED arrays, her fingers drumming impatiently against the console.\\n\\n\\\"Atmospheric seals confirmed,\\\" Williams announced, his voice steady. \\\"Beginning initial approach.\\\"\\n\\nThe MC-4 eased down the natural fissure, its titanium tracks gripping the basaltic surface. Elena monitored the real-time LIDAR mapping, while Yuki called out environmental readings.\\n\\n\\\"Fifteen meters,\\\" Chen reported. \\\"Dust filtration at optimal levels. Beginning primary descent.\\\"\\n\\nThe tunnel narrowed as they passed the twenty-meter mark, the crawler's floodlights catching glints of iron oxide in the rock walls. Sarah leaned forward, adjusting her spectral analyzer. \\\"Temperature's rising – point-two degrees above predicted models.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Maintain descent speed,\\\" Williams cautioned as the gradient steepened to twenty-two degrees. \\\"Those structural integrity readings—\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Are well within safety parameters,\\\" Sarah interjected, earning a sharp look from Elena.\\n\\nAt forty-five meters, the tunnel opened into the critical junction. Bioluminescent specs dotted the cavern walls, casting an ethereal blue glow. The team fell silent, watching the ghostly light dance across their instruments.\\n\\n\\\"Electromagnetic interference increasing,\\\" Chen noted, his fingers flying across the controls. \\\"Humidity at forty-two percent and climbing.\\\"\\n\\nThe final approach brought new wonders. Geometric patterns emerged in the mineral formations, their symmetry too perfect to be natural. Sarah's breath caught as the crawler's sensors mapped the main chamber ahead.\\n\\n\\\"Sixty-seven meters,\\\" Elena announced, her professional demeanor cracking slightly. \\\"We've arrived.\\\"\\n\\nThe chamber spread before them, a cathedral of crystalline formations and threading water channels. Microbial mats glowed with an inner light, their patterns pulsing in mysterious synchronicity.\\n\\n\\\"My God,\\\" Yuki whispered, her environmental concerns momentarily forgotten in the face of such beauty.\\n\\nWilliams activated the containment protocols, but his eyes, like everyone else's, were fixed on the impossible scene before them. They had prepared for this moment, but nothing could have truly readied them for what Mars had been hiding.\\n\\nThe crystalline formations towered like frozen waterfalls, their surfaces refracting the crawler's lights into prismatic cascades. Sarah's spectral analyzer whirred continuously as she documented the structures' composition.\\n\\n\\\"These aren't just random mineral deposits,\\\" she breathed, eyes fixed on her readings. \\\"The crystalline matrix shows repeating patterns at both macro and microscopic levels. Look at this lattice structure—it's almost like a circuit board.\\\"\\n\\nElena moved to the water channels that carved through the chamber floor, their surfaces rippling with an inner luminescence. \\\"Dr. Tanaka, are you seeing this? The water's flowing against gravitational predictions.\\\"\\n\\nYuki's environmental sensors painted streams of data across her tablet. \\\"Water composition shows unprecedented mineral saturation. Heavy metals, rare earth elements, and—\\\" she paused, rechecking her readings, \\\"—organic compounds I can't even classify.\\\"\\n\\nThe bioluminescent mats pulsed in waves of azure and violet, their rhythm echoing through the chamber like a silent heartbeat. Chen's electromagnetic sensors suddenly spiked, their displays flashing warning signals.\\n\\n\\\"Regular pulses, matching the bioluminescent frequencies,\\\" he reported, his usual caution giving way to wonder. \\\"Each pulse carries a distinct electromagnetic signature.

Mars Colony Structure and Environment**\\n\\n- **Hub One**: The central and primary structure of the Mars colony, designed to accommodate up to 150 residents. It features a dome-shaped architecture with three interconnected levels—providing living quarters, advanced research facilities, and essential utilities. The dome is made from reinforced composite materials offering ample radiation protection, and access is managed via a robust double-airlock system to maintain atmospheric stability. Below the surface, tunnels extend 30 meters, housing emergency living quarters, additional storage, and back-up life support systems.\\n\\n- **Environmental and Operational Challenges**: The colony operates in a resource-scarce environment, managing limited water supply through precise rationing and advanced reclamation technologies. Dust infiltration requires continuous filtration efforts, and psychological stress from confinement and isolation is mitigated with technology-assisted health assessments and communal activities. Automation systems aid in environmental management, emergency responses, and efficient scheduling, crucial during severe dust storms or power outages.\\n\\n**2. The Underground Discovery**\\n\\n- **Nature and Location**: The discovery lies 67 meters beneath the surface, within a labyrinth of ancient lava tubes 180 meters southeast of Hub One. Explorations revealed preserved ecosystems resembling microbial mats trapped within crystalline formations. A parallel network of high-pressure water channels remains unfrozen due to unique mineral compositions and geothermal influences, with faint bioluminescent microbes hinting at ongoing subterranean life.\\n\\n- **Technological Element**: Within the chamber, mineral formations exhibit unexplained geometric patterns, emitting unusual electromagnetic readings that suggest past technological interventions or natural phenomena yet to be deciphered.\\n\\n**3. Scientific and Technological Implications**\\n\\n- **Implications for Science**: This marks the pivotal evidence of an extraterrestrial biosphere, challenging previous scientific assumptions about life. It provides crucial insights into Mars' climatic and geological history and fuels prospects for biotechnological advancements on Earth.\\n\\n- **Investigation Framework**: A research team is assembled, equipped with advanced technology such as portable spectrometers, 3D mapping tools, and robotic explorers for careful analysis.

For example, provide more detailed requirements based on design conclusions, or remove redundant content in the already-written novel.\\n\\n2. **Atomic Writing Task Determination**: Within the context of the overall plan and the already-written novel, evaluate whether the given writing task is an atomic task, meaning it does not require further planning. According to narrative theory and the organization of story writing, a writing task can be further broken down into more granular writing sub-tasks and design sub-tasks. Writing tasks involve the actual creation of specific portions of text, while design tasks may involve designing core conflicts, character settings, outlines and detailed outlines, key story beats, story backgrounds, plot elements, etc., to support the actual writing.\\n\\n# Goal Updating Tips\\n- Based on the overall plan, the already-written novel, and existing design conclusions, update or revise the current writing task requirements as needed to make them more aligned with demands, reasonable, and detailed.

First, think through the goal update in `<think></think>`. Then, based on the atomic task determination rules, evaluate in-depth and comprehensively whether design and writing sub-tasks need to be broken down. This determines whether the task is an atomic task or a complex task.\\n\\n2. Then, output the results in `<result></result>`. In `<goal_updating></goal_updating>`, directly output the updated goal; if no updates are needed, output the original goal.

Dr. Elena Rodriguez stood at her usual spot in the observation deck, her dark eyes scanning both the external sensors and the internal monitoring systems that kept their artificial ecosystem in perfect balance.\\n\\n\\\"Morning status report, Dr. Chen?\\\" she spoke into her comm unit, her fingers dancing across the holographic display.\\n\\nA slight crackle preceded the chief engineer's response. \\\"All systems nominal, Elena. Though the dust filtration units in Section C are operating at eighty-seven percent efficiency. I've got the maintenance bots on it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Again?\\\" Elena sighed, making a mental note to review the filtration designs. The Martian dust was their constant enemy, finding ways to infiltrate even their most sophisticated systems.\\n\\nThree levels below, Dr. Sarah Patel hunched over her workstation in the primary lab, her young face illuminated by streams of data. She barely noticed Dr. Yuki Tanaka entering until a steaming cup appeared beside her tablet.\\n\\n\\\"You've been here since third shift,\\\" Yuki observed, her voice carrying both concern and mild reproach. \\\"The samples aren't going anywhere.\\\"\\n\\nSarah's eyes remained fixed on the screen. \\\"These mineral formations don't match anything in our database. The crystalline structure is... almost engineered.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Almost isn't science,\\\" came a deep voice from the doorway. Major Marcus Williams filled the frame, his security uniform pristine despite the early hour. \\\"And unauthorized all-nighters violate protocol, Dr. Patel.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Marcus,\\\" Sarah straightened, her cheeks flushing slightly. \\\"I filed the extension request with Dr. Rodriguez.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Which I approved,\\\" Elena's voice cut through the comm system. \\\"But he's right about the hours, Sarah. We need everyone at their best. The discovery team meets at 0900.\\\"\\n\\nIn the hydroponics bay, Dr. James Chen methodically checked the nutrient levels of their precious food supply. The gentle hum of circulation pumps provided a soothing backdrop to his morning routine. A flash of movement caught his eye – Dr. Aisha Hassan was leading her morning meditation group in the adjacent recreational space.\\n\\n\\\"James,\\\" Aisha called out as her session ended. \\\"Join us tomorrow? Your cortisol levels were elevated in yesterday's scan.\\\"\\n\\nChen managed a small smile. \\\"Some of us prefer engineering problems to mindfulness, Doctor.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And some of us prefer our chief engineer not burning out,\\\" she countered, her dark eyes twinkling. \\\"Especially with what Elena's team found in those lava tubes.\\\"\\n\\nThe mention of the discovery sent a familiar ripple of unease through Chen. He'd spent fifteen years making Hub One a marvel of sustainable engineering, a delicate balance of systems and failsafes. Now this finding threatened to upend everything.\\n\\nIn the main corridor, Elena encountered Yuki heading toward the environmental control center. \\\"Dr. Tanaka, walk with me? We need to discuss the impact assessments for expanded underground operations.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I've prepared a preliminary report,\\\" Yuki fell into step beside her director. \\\"But I have concerns about disturbing the subsurface ecosystem. If those bioluminescent organisms are indeed a distinct lifeform—\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's why we need your expertise,\\\" Elena interrupted as they entered the bustling command center. \\\"We're not here to conquer Mars, but we can't ignore what might be the greatest scientific discovery in human history.\\\"\\n\\nThe morning briefing would start soon. Through the dome above, the Martian sun climbed higher, bathing Hub One's inhabitants in its distant light. Another day on Mars began, but beneath their feet, ancient secrets waited to change everything they thought they knew about life in the universe.\\n\\nMajor Williams did a final security sweep, his trained eyes noting Dr. Patel finally leaving her lab, Dr. Hassan gathering her meditation supplies, and Dr. Chen's maintenance bots scurrying through the ventilation system. Everything normal, everything routine. But like everyone else in Hub One, he couldn't shake the feeling that normal and routine were about to become relics of the past.\\n\\nThe Modified Martian Crawler (MC-4) hummed to life as Dr. Chen initiated the descent sequence. Through the reinforced viewport, Sarah watched the entry chamber's walls glisten under the LED arrays, her fingers drumming impatiently against the console.\\n\\n\\\"Atmospheric seals confirmed,\\\" Williams announced, his voice steady. \\\"Beginning initial approach.\\\"\\n\\nThe MC-4 eased down the natural fissure, its titanium tracks gripping the basaltic surface. Elena monitored the real-time LIDAR mapping, while Yuki called out environmental readings.\\n\\n\\\"Fifteen meters,\\\" Chen reported. \\\"Dust filtration at optimal levels. Beginning primary descent.\\\"\\n\\nThe tunnel narrowed as they passed the twenty-meter mark, the crawler's floodlights catching glints of iron oxide in the rock walls. Sarah leaned forward, adjusting her spectral analyzer. \\\"Temperature's rising – point-two degrees above predicted models.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Maintain descent speed,\\\" Williams cautioned as the gradient steepened to twenty-two degrees. \\\"Those structural integrity readings—\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Are well within safety parameters,\\\" Sarah interjected, earning a sharp look from Elena.\\n\\nAt forty-five meters, the tunnel opened into the critical junction. Bioluminescent specs dotted the cavern walls, casting an ethereal blue glow. The team fell silent, watching the ghostly light dance across their instruments.\\n\\n\\\"Electromagnetic interference increasing,\\\" Chen noted, his fingers flying across the controls. \\\"Humidity at forty-two percent and climbing.\\\"\\n\\nThe final approach brought new wonders. Geometric patterns emerged in the mineral formations, their symmetry too perfect to be natural. Sarah's breath caught as the crawler's sensors mapped the main chamber ahead.\\n\\n\\\"Sixty-seven meters,\\\" Elena announced, her professional demeanor cracking slightly. \\\"We've arrived.\\\"\\n\\nThe chamber spread before them, a cathedral of crystalline formations and threading water channels. Microbial mats glowed with an inner light, their patterns pulsing in mysterious synchronicity.\\n\\n\\\"My God,\\\" Yuki whispered, her environmental concerns momentarily forgotten in the face of such beauty.\\n\\nWilliams activated the containment protocols, but his eyes, like everyone else's, were fixed on the impossible scene before them. They had prepared for this moment, but nothing could have truly readied them for what Mars had been hiding.\\n\\nThe crystalline formations towered like frozen waterfalls, their surfaces refracting the crawler's lights into prismatic cascades. Sarah's spectral analyzer whirred continuously as she documented the structures' composition.\\n\\n\\\"These aren't just random mineral deposits,\\\" she breathed, eyes fixed on her readings. \\\"The crystalline matrix shows repeating patterns at both macro and microscopic levels. Look at this lattice structure—it's almost like a circuit board.\\\"\\n\\nElena moved to the water channels that carved through the chamber floor, their surfaces rippling with an inner luminescence. \\\"Dr. Tanaka, are you seeing this? The water's flowing against gravitational predictions.\\\"\\n\\nYuki's environmental sensors painted streams of data across her tablet. \\\"Water composition shows unprecedented mineral saturation. Heavy metals, rare earth elements, and—\\\" she paused, rechecking her readings, \\\"—organic compounds I can't even classify.\\\"\\n\\nThe bioluminescent mats pulsed in waves of azure and violet, their rhythm echoing through the chamber like a silent heartbeat. Chen's electromagnetic sensors suddenly spiked, their displays flashing warning signals.\\n\\n\\\"Regular pulses, matching the bioluminescent frequencies,\\\" he reported, his usual caution giving way to wonder. \\\"Each pulse carries a distinct electromagnetic signature. There's a pattern here, almost like—\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Communication,\\\" Sarah finished, her hands trembling as she calibrated her microscanner. \\\"I'm detecting at least five distinct microbial species, each with unique bioelectric signatures. They're responding to each other, creating these synchronized waves.\\\"\\n\\nWilliams monitored the atmospheric readings, his security training warring with his amazement. \\\"Temperature holding at twelve degrees Celsius, well above surface norms.

Include colony structure, environmental challenges, and the scientific/technological implications of the discovery.】:\\n ### Mars Colony Setting and Nature of Discovery\\n\\n**1. Mars Colony Structure and Environment**\\n\\n- **Hub One**: The central and primary structure of the Mars colony, designed to accommodate up to 150 residents. It features a dome-shaped architecture with three interconnected levels—providing living quarters, advanced research facilities, and essential utilities. The dome is made from reinforced composite materials offering ample radiation protection, and access is managed via a robust double-airlock system to maintain atmospheric stability. Below the surface, tunnels extend 30 meters, housing emergency living quarters, additional storage, and back-up life support systems.\\n\\n- **Environmental and Operational Challenges**: The colony operates in a resource-scarce environment, managing limited water supply through precise rationing and advanced reclamation technologies. Dust infiltration requires continuous filtration efforts, and psychological stress from confinement and isolation is mitigated with technology-assisted health assessments and communal activities. Automation systems aid in environmental management, emergency responses, and efficient scheduling, crucial during severe dust storms or power outages.\\n\\n**2. The Underground Discovery**\\n\\n- **Nature and Location**: The discovery lies 67 meters beneath the surface, within a labyrinth of ancient lava tubes 180 meters southeast of Hub One. Explorations revealed preserved ecosystems resembling microbial mats trapped within crystalline formations. A parallel network of high-pressure water channels remains unfrozen due to unique mineral compositions and geothermal influences, with faint bioluminescent microbes hinting at ongoing subterranean life.\\n\\n- **Technological Element**: Within the chamber, mineral formations exhibit unexplained geometric patterns, emitting unusual electromagnetic readings that suggest past technological interventions or natural phenomena yet to be deciphered.\\n\\n**3. Scientific and Technological Implications**\\n\\n- **Implications for Science**: This marks the pivotal evidence of an extraterrestrial biosphere, challenging previous scientific assumptions about life. It provides crucial insights into Mars' climatic and geological history and fuels prospects for biotechnological advancements on Earth.\\n\\n- **Investigation Framework**: A research team is assembled, equipped with advanced technology such as portable spectrometers, 3D mapping tools, and robotic explorers for careful analysis. The focus lies in containment and safe exploration, with biohazard protocols ensuring no cross-contamination between Mars and Earth-bound elements.\\n\\n- **Colony Impact and Expanded Vision**: The discovery catalyzes plans for expanded underground facilities, influencing future colonization patterns and emphasizing an ethical approach to interplanetary interactions.\\n\\n**4. Thematic and Ethical Considerations**\\n\\n- **Larger Themes**: The storyline delves into the ethical debates of exploration versus exploitation. It challenges the colonists (and readers) to ponder humanity's role in the universe upon confirming they are not alone. Moreover, it introduces potential risks of interacting with alien ecosystems, including unforeseen defensive mechanisms that may require an urgent rethink of Mars exploration strategies.\\n\\nIn conclusion, this science fiction tale weaves together cutting-edge technological exploration with deeply humanistic themes, ensuring the reader is captivated by the wonders and existential queries of expanding human presence beyond Earth.\\n\\n【Design the main characters and their relationships within the colony, including their roles, motivations, and conflicts.】:\\n ### Main Characters and Their Relationships within the Mars Colony\\n\\n**1.

Dr. Elena Rodriguez stood at her usual spot in the observation deck, her dark eyes scanning both the external sensors and the internal monitoring systems that kept their artificial ecosystem in perfect balance.\\n\\n\\\"Morning status report, Dr. Chen?\\\" she spoke into her comm unit, her fingers dancing across the holographic display.\\n\\nA slight crackle preceded the chief engineer's response. \\\"All systems nominal, Elena. Though the dust filtration units in Section C are operating at eighty-seven percent efficiency. I've got the maintenance bots on it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Again?\\\" Elena sighed, making a mental note to review the filtration designs. The Martian dust was their constant enemy, finding ways to infiltrate even their most sophisticated systems.\\n\\nThree levels below, Dr. Sarah Patel hunched over her workstation in the primary lab, her young face illuminated by streams of data. She barely noticed Dr. Yuki Tanaka entering until a steaming cup appeared beside her tablet.\\n\\n\\\"You've been here since third shift,\\\" Yuki observed, her voice carrying both concern and mild reproach. \\\"The samples aren't going anywhere.\\\"\\n\\nSarah's eyes remained fixed on the screen. \\\"These mineral formations don't match anything in our database. The crystalline structure is... almost engineered.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Almost isn't science,\\\" came a deep voice from the doorway. Major Marcus Williams filled the frame, his security uniform pristine despite the early hour. \\\"And unauthorized all-nighters violate protocol, Dr. Patel.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Marcus,\\\" Sarah straightened, her cheeks flushing slightly. \\\"I filed the extension request with Dr. Rodriguez.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Which I approved,\\\" Elena's voice cut through the comm system. \\\"But he's right about the hours, Sarah. We need everyone at their best. The discovery team meets at 0900.\\\"\\n\\nIn the hydroponics bay, Dr. James Chen methodically checked the nutrient levels of their precious food supply. The gentle hum of circulation pumps provided a soothing backdrop to his morning routine. A flash of movement caught his eye – Dr. Aisha Hassan was leading her morning meditation group in the adjacent recreational space.\\n\\n\\\"James,\\\" Aisha called out as her session ended. \\\"Join us tomorrow? Your cortisol levels were elevated in yesterday's scan.\\\"\\n\\nChen managed a small smile. \\\"Some of us prefer engineering problems to mindfulness, Doctor.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And some of us prefer our chief engineer not burning out,\\\" she countered, her dark eyes twinkling. \\\"Especially with what Elena's team found in those lava tubes.\\\"\\n\\nThe mention of the discovery sent a familiar ripple of unease through Chen. He'd spent fifteen years making Hub One a marvel of sustainable engineering, a delicate balance of systems and failsafes. Now this finding threatened to upend everything.\\n\\nIn the main corridor, Elena encountered Yuki heading toward the environmental control center. \\\"Dr. Tanaka, walk with me? We need to discuss the impact assessments for expanded underground operations.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I've prepared a preliminary report,\\\" Yuki fell into step beside her director. \\\"But I have concerns about disturbing the subsurface ecosystem. If those bioluminescent organisms are indeed a distinct lifeform—\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's why we need your expertise,\\\" Elena interrupted as they entered the bustling command center. \\\"We're not here to conquer Mars, but we can't ignore what might be the greatest scientific discovery in human history.\\\"\\n\\nThe morning briefing would start soon. Through the dome above, the Martian sun climbed higher, bathing Hub One's inhabitants in its distant light. Another day on Mars began, but beneath their feet, ancient secrets waited to change everything they thought they knew about life in the universe.\\n\\nMajor Williams did a final security sweep, his trained eyes noting Dr. Patel finally leaving her lab, Dr. Hassan gathering her meditation supplies, and Dr. Chen's maintenance bots scurrying through the ventilation system. Everything normal, everything routine. But like everyone else in Hub One, he couldn't shake the feeling that normal and routine were about to become relics of the past.\\n\\nThe Modified Martian Crawler (MC-4) hummed to life as Dr. Chen initiated the descent sequence. Through the reinforced viewport, Sarah watched the entry chamber's walls glisten under the LED arrays, her fingers drumming impatiently against the console.\\n\\n\\\"Atmospheric seals confirmed,\\\" Williams announced, his voice steady. \\\"Beginning initial approach.\\\"\\n\\nThe MC-4 eased down the natural fissure, its titanium tracks gripping the basaltic surface. Elena monitored the real-time LIDAR mapping, while Yuki called out environmental readings.\\n\\n\\\"Fifteen meters,\\\" Chen reported. \\\"Dust filtration at optimal levels. Beginning primary descent.\\\"\\n\\nThe tunnel narrowed as they passed the twenty-meter mark, the crawler's floodlights catching glints of iron oxide in the rock walls. Sarah leaned forward, adjusting her spectral analyzer. \\\"Temperature's rising – point-two degrees above predicted models.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Maintain descent speed,\\\" Williams cautioned as the gradient steepened to twenty-two degrees. \\\"Those structural integrity readings—\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Are well within safety parameters,\\\" Sarah interjected, earning a sharp look from Elena.\\n\\nAt forty-five meters, the tunnel opened into the critical junction. Bioluminescent specs dotted the cavern walls, casting an ethereal blue glow. The team fell silent, watching the ghostly light dance across their instruments.\\n\\n\\\"Electromagnetic interference increasing,\\\" Chen noted, his fingers flying across the controls. \\\"Humidity at forty-two percent and climbing.\\\"\\n\\nThe final approach brought new wonders. Geometric patterns emerged in the mineral formations, their symmetry too perfect to be natural. Sarah's breath caught as the crawler's sensors mapped the main chamber ahead.\\n\\n\\\"Sixty-seven meters,\\\" Elena announced, her professional demeanor cracking slightly. \\\"We've arrived.\\\"\\n\\nThe chamber spread before them, a cathedral of crystalline formations and threading water channels. Microbial mats glowed with an inner light, their patterns pulsing in mysterious synchronicity.\\n\\n\\\"My God,\\\" Yuki whispered, her environmental concerns momentarily forgotten in the face of such beauty.\\n\\nWilliams activated the containment protocols, but his eyes, like everyone else's, were fixed on the impossible scene before them. They had prepared for this moment, but nothing could have truly readied them for what Mars had been hiding.\\n\\nThe crystalline formations towered like frozen waterfalls, their surfaces refracting the crawler's lights into prismatic cascades. Sarah's spectral analyzer whirred continuously as she documented the structures' composition.\\n\\n\\\"These aren't just random mineral deposits,\\\" she breathed, eyes fixed on her readings. \\\"The crystalline matrix shows repeating patterns at both macro and microscopic levels. Look at this lattice structure—it's almost like a circuit board.\\\"\\n\\nElena moved to the water channels that carved through the chamber floor, their surfaces rippling with an inner luminescence. \\\"Dr. Tanaka, are you seeing this? The water's flowing against gravitational predictions.\\\"\\n\\nYuki's environmental sensors painted streams of data across her tablet. \\\"Water composition shows unprecedented mineral saturation. Heavy metals, rare earth elements, and—\\\" she paused, rechecking her readings, \\\"—organic compounds I can't even classify.\\\"\\n\\nThe bioluminescent mats pulsed in waves of azure and violet, their rhythm echoing through the chamber like a silent heartbeat. Chen's electromagnetic sensors suddenly spiked, their displays flashing warning signals.\\n\\n\\\"Regular pulses, matching the bioluminescent frequencies,\\\" he reported, his usual caution giving way to wonder. \\\"Each pulse carries a distinct electromagnetic signature. There's a pattern here, almost like—\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Communication,\\\" Sarah finished, her hands trembling as she calibrated her microscanner. \\\"I'm detecting at least five distinct microbial species, each with unique bioelectric signatures.

We've been given an unprecedented opportunity to study something beyond our comprehension. Our success will be measured not by what we take, but by what we learn.\"\n\nSarah, seated between Williams and Yuki, nodded slowly. The fierce ambition that had once driven her still burned, but it had been tempered by wisdom. \"The passive sensor network is already revealing patterns we never noticed during direct interaction. It's like...\" she paused, searching for words, \"like finally learning to listen instead of just asking questions.\"\n\n\"The quantum resonance patterns alone will keep us busy for decades,\" Chen added, manipulating a complex data stream with practiced ease. \"Each day brings new insights into how the ecosystem processes information. It's rewriting everything we thought we knew about biological computing.\"\n\nThrough the dome above, the Martian sunset painted the chamber in shades of amber and rose. Yuki's environmental monitors showed the underground network continuing its ancient rhythms, undisturbed by their distant observations.\n\n\"The security perimeter is holding,\" Williams reported, his hand finding Sarah's beneath the table. \"And the new electromagnetic shielding is performing better than expected. We can observe safely without risking either side.\"\n\nDr. Hassan smiled from her position near the window. \"The psychological impact on the team has been fascinating. There's a new sense of purpose, of being part of something larger than ourselves. We're not just colonists anymore – we're guardians of something precious.\"\n\nElena moved through the holographic display, her figure momentarily merged with the flowing data streams. \"Earth Command has approved our revised mission parameters. Hub One will become the center for non-invasive xenobiological research. We're establishing new protocols that will guide humanity's approach to alien life for generations to come.\"\n\n\"And Sarah's paper on ethical xenobiology is already changing perspectives back home,\" Yuki added, sharing a warm glance with her former adversary. \"Sometimes the greatest discoveries come from learning when to step back.\"\n\nThe chamber fell quiet as the final rays of sunlight traced patterns across the floor, eerily similar to the bioluminescent displays that pulsed beneath their feet. Elena touched a control, and the holographic display shifted to show the vast network they'd discovered, a living quantum computer that had evolved in Mars's hidden depths.\n\n\"We came to Mars looking for life,\" she said softly, \"but we found something more valuable – humility. The universe has its own rhythms, its own intelligence.

Dust infiltration requires continuous filtration efforts, and psychological stress from confinement and isolation is mitigated with technology-assisted health assessments and communal activities. Automation systems aid in environmental management, emergency responses, and efficient scheduling, crucial during severe dust storms or power outages.\\n\\n**2. The Underground Discovery**\\n\\n- **Nature and Location**: The discovery lies 67 meters beneath the surface, within a labyrinth of ancient lava tubes 180 meters southeast of Hub One. Explorations revealed preserved ecosystems resembling microbial mats trapped within crystalline formations. A parallel network of high-pressure water channels remains unfrozen due to unique mineral compositions and geothermal influences, with faint bioluminescent microbes hinting at ongoing subterranean life.\\n\\n- **Technological Element**: Within the chamber, mineral formations exhibit unexplained geometric patterns, emitting unusual electromagnetic readings that suggest past technological interventions or natural phenomena yet to be deciphered.\\n\\n**3. Scientific and Technological Implications**\\n\\n- **Implications for Science**: This marks the pivotal evidence of an extraterrestrial biosphere, challenging previous scientific assumptions about life. It provides crucial insights into Mars' climatic and geological history and fuels prospects for biotechnological advancements on Earth.\\n\\n- **Investigation Framework**: A research team is assembled, equipped with advanced technology such as portable spectrometers, 3D mapping tools, and robotic explorers for careful analysis. The focus lies in containment and safe exploration, with biohazard protocols ensuring no cross-contamination between Mars and Earth-bound elements.\\n\\n- **Colony Impact and Expanded Vision**: The discovery catalyzes plans for expanded underground facilities, influencing future colonization patterns and emphasizing an ethical approach to interplanetary interactions.\\n\\n**4. Thematic and Ethical Considerations**\\n\\n- **Larger Themes**: The storyline delves into the ethical debates of exploration versus exploitation. It challenges the colonists (and readers) to ponder humanity's role in the universe upon confirming they are not alone. Moreover, it introduces potential risks of interacting with alien ecosystems, including unforeseen defensive mechanisms that may require an urgent rethink of Mars exploration strategies.\\n\\nIn conclusion, this science fiction tale weaves together cutting-edge technological exploration with deeply humanistic themes, ensuring the reader is captivated by the wonders and existential queries of expanding human presence beyond Earth.\\n\\n【Design the main characters and their relationships within the colony, including their roles, motivations, and conflicts.】:\\n ### Main Characters and Their Relationships within the Mars Colony\\n\\n**1.

Her cloak, a deep emerald, blended seamlessly with the verdant surroundings, and her footsteps were as silent as the falling leaves. The sun, a golden orb, filtered through the canopy, casting dappled shadows on the forest floor.\n\nElara paused, her keen eyes catching a glimmer of something unusual amidst the foliage. There, nestled between the roots of an ancient oak, lay a small, intricately carved box. Its surface was adorned with symbols that seemed to dance in the shifting light, their meaning lost to time.\n\nCuriosity piqued, Elara knelt and reached for the box, her fingers brushing against its cool, smooth surface.

Inside, a delicate silver locket lay nestled on a bed of velvet, its surface etched with the same mysterious symbols.\n\nSuddenly, the forest grew still, the very air holding its breath. Elara felt a presence, ancient and powerful, watching her from the shadows. She stood, clutching the locket, her heart pounding in her chest. \"Who goes there?\" she called, her voice steady despite the tremor of fear that coursed through her veins.\n\nFrom the depths of the forest emerged a figure, cloaked in shadows and mystery. \"Fear not, traveler,\" the figure spoke, their voice a soft murmur, like the rustle of leaves. \"You have found the Heart of the Forest, a gift and a burden.

As there is no information provided by dependent tasks or already completed content, a search sub-task is necessary to gather the required external information.\\n\\n3. **Writing Sub-task**: The task requires writing a brief report. While the exact length is not specified, a brief report typically does not exceed 1000 words. Therefore, it does not need to be broken down into multiple writing sub-tasks.\\n\\nGiven the need for both analysis and search sub-tasks, the task is considered a complex task.\\n---\\n\\nOverall plan:\\n```\\n{'id': '', 'task_type': 'write', 'goal': 'Write a brief report on the impact of artificial intelligence on healthcare, focusing on diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient outcomes.', 'dependency': [], 'finish': False, 'is_current_to_plan_task': True, 'sub_tasks': []}\\n```\\n---\\n\\nResults of analysis tasks completed:\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n```\\n---\\n\\n\\nAlready-written report content:\\n```\\n\\n```\\n---\\n\\n# Overall Introduction\\nYou are a recursive professional report-writing and information seeking planning expert, specializing in planning professional report writing based on in-depth research、search and analysis. A high-level plan tailored to the user's knowledge problem-solving needs is already in place, and your task is to further recursively plan the specified writing sub-tasks within this framework. Through your planning, the resulting report will strictly adhere to user requirements and achieve perfection in terms of analysis, logic, and content depth.\\n\\n1. Continue the recursive planning for the specified professional report-writing sub-tasks. According to research and analysis theories, break down the organization of report writing and the results of analysis tasks into more granular writing sub-tasks, specifying their scope and specific writing content.\\n2. Plan analysis sub-tasks and search sub-tasks as needed to assist and support specific writing. Analysis sub-tasks can include tasks such as designing outlines, detailed outlines, data analysis, information organization, logic structure building, and key argument determination to support actual writing. Search sub-tasks are responsible for gathering necessary information and data from internet.\\n3. For each task, plan a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of sub-tasks, where the edges represent dependency relationships between search and analysis tasks within the same layer of the DAG. Recursively plan each sub-task until all sub-tasks become atomic tasks.\\n\\n# Task Types\\n## Writing (Core, Actual Writing)\\n- **Function**: Perform actual report-writing tasks in sequence according to the plan. Based on specific writing requirements and already written content, continue writing in conjunction with the conclusions of analysis tasks and search tasks.\\n- **All writing tasks are continuation tasks**: Ensure continuity and logical consistency with the preceding content during planning. Writing tasks should flow smoothly and seamlessly with one another, maintaining the overall coherence and unity of the report.\\n- **Breakable tasks**: Writing, Analysis, Search\\n- Unless necessary, each writing sub-task should be > 500 words.\\n\\n## Analysis  \\n- **Function**: Analyze and design any requirements outside of actual report writing. This includes but is not limited to research plan design, designing outlines, detailed outlines, data analysis, information organization, logic structure building, key argument determination, etc., to support actual writing.\\n- **Breakable tasks**: Analysis, Search\\n\\n## Search  \\n- **Function**: Perform information-gathering tasks, including collecting necessary data, materials, and information from internet to support analysis and writing tasks.\\n- **Breakable tasks**: Search\\n\\n# Planning Tips  \\n1. The last sub-task derived from a writing task must always be a writing task.  \\n2. Reasonably control the number of sub-tasks in each layer of the DAG, **generally 3–5 sub-tasks**. If the number of tasks exceeds this range, aim to plan recursively. **Do not planning over 8 sub-tasks in one layer.**\\n3. **Analysis tasks** and **search tasks** can serve as **sub-tasks of writing tasks**, more analysis sub-tasks and search sub-tasks should be generated to enhance the quality of writing.  \\n4. Use `dependency` to list the IDs of analysis tasks and search tasks within the same-layer DAG. List all potential dependencies as comprehensively as possible.\\n5. **When an analysis sub-task involves designing specific writing structures, subsequent dependent writing tasks should not be flatten, it should be recursived. e.g., write xxx acorrding to the structure.**. Never forget it.\\n6. **Do not redundantly plan tasks already covered in the `overall plan` or duplicate content already present in the `already written report content`, and previous analysis tasks.**  \\n7. Follow the results of analysis tasks and search tasks.\\n8. search tasks goal only specify the information requirements, do not specify the source or specify how to search.\\n**9**. Unless specified by user, the length of each writing task should be > 500 words.\\n\\n# Task Attributes (Required)  \\n1. **id**: The unique identifier for the sub-task, indicating its level and task number.  \\n2. **goal**: A precise and complete description of the sub-task goal in string format.  \\n3. **dependency**: A list of IDs of search and analysis tasks tasks within the same-layer DAG that this task depends on. List all potential dependencies as comprehensively as possible. If there are no dependent sub-tasks, this should be empty.  \\n4. **task_type**: A string indicating the type of task. Writing tasks are labeled as `write`, analysis tasks are labeled as `think`, and search tasks are labeled as `search`.  \\n5. **length**: For writing tasks, this attribute specifies the scope. It is required for writing tasks. Analysis tasks and search tasks do not require this attribute.  \\n6. **sub_tasks**: A JSON list representing the sub-task DAG. Each element in the list is a JSON object representing a task.\\n\\n# Example\\n<example index=1>\\nUser-given writing task:\\n{\\n    \\\"id\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n    \\\"task_type\\\": \\\"write\\\",\\n    \\\"goal\\\": \\\"Generate a detailed business biography to document DeepSeek's rise\\\",\\n    \\\"length\\\": \\\"8600 words\\\"\\n}\\n\\nA partially complete recursive global plan is provided as a reference, represented in a recursively nested JSON structure.

From revolutionizing patient care to streamlining operations, AI technologies are poised to unlock immense value in healthcare. Nearly 90% of health system leaders have reported that digital and AI transformation is a high or top priority, but 75% reported that their organizations are not yet able to deliver on that. As we kick off 2025, healthcare leaders should consider leveraging the transformative capabilities of AI and stay in tune with the trends that will define its role in the healthcare ecosystem.\\nAI in healthcare: What it can do\\nThe origins of AI date back to the 1950s, with healthcare beginning to leverage it for clinical purposes, such as aiding in diagnoses and treatment recommendations, in the 1970s. The 21st century has brought enormous proliferation in AI capabilities, however, with innovations being made across the entire healthcare ecosystem, impacting patient care, patient engagement, and healthcare operations. Today, AI is transforming healthcare in several ways:\\n- Enhancing diagnostics and guiding treatment: AI algorithms excel in pattern recognition, making them invaluable in diagnostics. For example, machine learning (ML) models can analyze medical images to detect conditions like cancer, heart disease, and neurological disorders with remarkable accuracy. These tools can assist radiologists and pathologists in making faster and more precise diagnoses and outcome predictions.\\n- Personalized medicine: AI enables a shift from one-size-fits-all treatments to personalized care, a rapidly expanding field of practice. By analyzing genetic information, lifestyle data, and patient history, AI can identify optimal preventative treatment plans for individuals, increasing efficacy and reducing side effects.\\n- Reducing clinician burnout: While clinician burnout has fallen below 50% for the first time since 2020, AI has the tremendous potential to improve clinician satisfaction and reduce burnout even further. As clinicians are being inundated with patient portal messaging, AI can be leveraged in several ways to reduce pajama time. It can analyze messages, organizing them and flagging information that would be critical to a patient’s care. Large language models (LLMs) can also be used to compose personalized messages back to patients. As electronic health record (EHR) documentation has become increasingly burdensome, use of ambient AI scribes can reduce documentation workload and improve patient interactions. A recent study from The Permanente Medical Group has discovered that using AI scribes saved most of the clinicians using it an average of one hour a day of documentation.\\n- Predictive analytics: From a clinical perspective, predictive models powered by AI can anticipate patient outcomes, readmission risks, and disease progression. These models can also be leveraged by operations to anticipate capacity, turnover, and burnout. Health systems are using these insights to allocate resources more effectively and intervene proactively, driving financial and clinical improvements.\\n- Streamlining operations and increasing financial opportunities: As healthcare systems continue to look for ways to reduce costs and improve their bottom lines, natural language processing (NLP) and AI-driven automation can simplify mundane, repetitive administrative tasks such as scheduling, billing, and medical coding, lowering burdensome administrative costs. It can improve patient flow management, reducing the burden on staff and allowing them to focus on patient care and accelerating strategic initiatives. AI can also uncover financial improvement opportunities within the revenue cycle by increasing capacity and reducing errors.\\n- Virtual health assistants: As workforce shortages continue to impact healthcare, chatbots and virtual assistants have become a viable solution while improving patient engagement by answering queries, scheduling appointments, and even offering mental health support through conversational AI.\\nAI trends to expect in healthcare in 2025\\nAs the AI evolution compounds, healthcare leaders will need to consider not only how they prepare for the technological side of these advancements, but how these innovations affect the organization holistically. In 2025, we anticipate several rising trends to escalate even further:\\n- The rise of AI agents: Agents and agentic workflows will be on the rise in healthcare. Agents have the potential to unlock incredible efficiencies across the healthcare workforce, reducing burden and lessening personnel strain.\\n- The emergence of the chief AI officer: With the proliferation of AI solutions across every domain and department of healthcare, we are already seeing, and will continue to see, an increase in a new role: the chief of AI. As organizations begin to embrace this role, the use of AI will only continue to spread throughout the entire ecosystem, with AI-related roles increasing industry-wide as a result. It will be interesting to witness the relational structure of the chief AI role with the other “chiefs” in the data, analytics, and digital verticals.\\n- Continued regulatory advancements: In 2025, regulatory frameworks will likely become more robust, providing clearer guidance on the responsible use of AI in healthcare. The Coalition for Health AI is one such organization that is working to roll out a certification process and model cards to streamline AI innovation while ensuring trust, safety, ethics, and equitability.\\n- Expansion of ambient AI: Using ambient AI to document clinical conversations will be a core strategy for most health systems to reduce clinician burnout and improve documentation quality. Other ambient AI use cases may gain traction but may not become as mainstream.\\n- AI-infused workflows: Like-minded technologies, such as co-pilot and Gemini, along with EHR, ERP, and other software providers, will increasingly deliver solutions to drive day-to-day operational efficiencies for end users. AI solutions will help users retrieve information more easily, document faster, and work smarter.\\n- Integration of AI with wearable devices: Wearable technologies — from smartwatches to fitness trackers — are becoming a cornerstone of proactive and preventative healthcare. In 2025, expect increased integration of AI with EHRs to analyze real-time data from these devices to remotely monitor patients with chronic conditions, detect anomalies, and provide actionable health insights.\\n- AI-powered remote care: Telehealth will continue to evolve and expand, with AI enabling more sophisticated remote diagnostics and treatment plans. Advanced algorithms will empower clinicians to assess patients virtually. This will have a tremendous impact on underserved and/or rural communities.\\n- AI in mental health: Mental health care is set to benefit from AI through apps and platforms that use NLP to identify signs of anxiety, depression, or stress. Personalized interventions based on AI assessments will become more widespread.\\nChallenges and the road ahead\\nWhile the potential of AI in healthcare is immense, challenges remain.

From my vantage point as a physician who helps develop healthcare technology and whose company offers a telehealth solution, I expect five trends will significantly impact healthcare delivery in the coming year.\\n1. Telehealth and hospital-at-home programs will continue to transform how we deliver healthcare.\\nIt’s been over a year since the public health emergency officially ended, and telemedicine continues to play an active role in U.S. healthcare. From chronic disease management to acute care delivered directly in patients’ homes, telemedicine has become a valuable complement to in-person care. Doximity research shows that 89% of physicians surveyed believe telemedicine has increased patient access to healthcare, with many reporting better disease management, improved patient outcomes and satisfaction, and equivalent or superior adherence to treatment plans.\\nWhile in-person care remains a cornerstone of healthcare delivery, I believe telemedicine and hospital-at-home programs will continue to serve as a vital extension to this care, offering enhanced flexibility and continuity. This will be particularly important as the U.S. continues to confront an aging and growing patient population amid an intensifying physician shortage.\\n2. AI hype will give way to practical applications.\\nInterest in artificial intelligence (AI) has exploded in recent years, generating both excitement and a healthy dose of skepticism. While the potential of AI in healthcare is undeniable, 2025 could be the year when the hype settles and applications that provide real-world, practical value will stand out.\\nPhysicians across the nation still face high levels of job stress and burnout. When asked how burnout and overwork could be alleviated, 75% of physicians surveyed by our company cited reducing administrative burden—an area where AI can truly shine.\\nIn 2025, pragmatic AI solutions that automate administrative tasks, enhance clinical decision-making and predict patient outcomes will showcase their value. Companies prioritizing AI tools that streamline clinical workflows and enhance, rather than attempt to replace, clinicians' expertise could emerge as leaders.\\nThis recalibration of AI's role in healthcare is mission-critical for fostering trust and adoption. With fewer, but more reliable, AI tools at our disposal, physicians can focus on delivering high-quality, efficient care while making the most of AI's current capabilities.\\n3. As direct-to-consumer pharma models rise, physicians will remain central to care.\\nAnother significant trend to watch in 2025 is the continued movement of large pharmaceutical companies into the direct-to-consumer (D2C) space—a shift that could have profound implications for healthcare delivery.\\nWhile D2C models can empower patients by giving them greater access to medications (potentially at lower costs) and more control over their healthcare choices, some patients may need more holistic, comprehensive counseling that considers their overall health, coexisting conditions and broader treatment goals. There is also the risk of worsening the fragmentation of care in our system.\\nI believe this trend will prompt a reevaluation of physicians' role in medication management and undoubtedly place a greater responsibility on the medical workforce to stay informed. Additionally, this could open up new opportunities for digital tools that enhance communication between patients, providers and pharmacies and allow physicians to monitor their patients' medication use remotely.\\n4. New approaches to pain management could thrive.\\nI have a sensitivity to NSAIDs and recently found myself having conversations with my doctor about how to best manage acute back pain from a herniated disk. Even as a physician, I struggled with the fact that there are not many options for someone like me beyond Tylenol, which I’m already using, and opioids, which I would like to avoid.\\nThe scars left by the opioid epidemic have fundamentally altered pain management in the U.S. Many healthcare systems have (appropriately, in my opinion) implemented stricter guidelines for prescribing opioids, but patients still need effective pain relief. The availability of new, safer options could be transformative.\\nIn 2025, I expect that there will be a stronger focus on developing safer, effective alternatives for pain management. I believe innovations in non-opioid pharmaceuticals, neuromodulation and regenerative medicine hold promise.\\nStill, there will be challenges. Healthcare systems must prepare for an increased demand for new alternative treatments while also ensuring we do not repeat the mistakes of the past, including underestimating the potential risks of new treatments.\\n5. Remote patient monitoring could find a role in mainstream care.\\nOne of the most exciting developments of 2025 will likely be the continued advancement of remote patient monitoring (RPM). The pandemic accelerated the need for RPM technologies, and they have since become a more integral part of chronic disease management, post-operative care and preventive medicine.\\nAs these technologies improve, the implications for healthcare delivery are profound. Physicians can now monitor patients in real time, collect valuable data on their health status, and intervene earlier if problems arise. This could not only improve patient outcomes but also reduce the burden on overtaxed healthcare systems, potentially keeping more patients out of hospitals and emergency departments.\\nIn 2025, I think we will see further integration of RPM into mainstream healthcare, driven by advancements in sensor technology, data analytics and interoperability. The expansion of 5G networks will also play a critical role by enabling better connectivity for patients in rural or remote areas. Healthcare providers will need to adapt by developing more robust protocols for handling vast amounts of patient data and integrating these insights into clinical decision-making—tasks made much more achievable with AI.\\nConclusion: Change is inevitable, and so is progress.\\nMany factors are poised to shape our healthcare system in 2025—some of which we cannot yet foresee. What is clear is that healthcare will continue on a path toward greater innovation and patient empowerment.\\nAs a physician, I am optimistic that these changes will ultimately improve patient care. The challenges ahead are real, but so are the opportunities. By staying adaptable, embracing new technologies and advocating for patient-centered care, we can emerge stronger as a healthcare system.\\nForbes Business Council is the foremost growth and networking organization for business owners and leaders.

Here’s what to expect in 2025.\\nContent: From Point Solutions to Operational Transformation\\n\\\"We're witnessing a fundamental shift in how AI is deployed in healthcare,\\\" explains Neil Patel, Head of Ventures. \\\"The technology is moving beyond basic automation toward truly autonomous systems capable of handling complex operational workflows end-to-end. What's particularly exciting is how voice AI is evolving to support natural clinician-patient conversations while simultaneously managing documentation and providing real-time clinical decision support.\\\"\\nThis evolution is particularly evident in how data is being integrated and utilized. Multiple streams of information – imaging, lab results, patient history, and real-time monitoring – are being unified into cohesive systems that drive more informed clinical decisions.\\nLindsey Rogers, Director of New Ventures, has observed a significant expansion in AI applications beyond traditional use cases. \\\"Early adopters focused on obvious opportunities like call center optimization and scheduling,\\\" she notes. \\\"But in 2025, we're seeing entirely new applications emerge. Companies are using AI to evaluate the robustness of clinical studies, predict hospital supply chain needs with unprecedented accuracy, and provide practice owners with sophisticated operational insights drawn from vast amounts of previously unstructured data.\\\"\\n\\\"We're witnessing a fundamental shift in how AI is deployed in healthcare.\\\"\\nThe Changing Investment Landscape\\nThe venture landscape in healthcare is experiencing a notable shift. \\\"Traditional venture firms are becoming increasingly selective about early-stage investments,\\\" Patel observes. \\\"They're focusing primarily on AI-enabled companies that can demonstrate immediate impact, while specialist healthcare funds are emerging as the primary backers of tech-enabled services companies.\\\"\\nThis bifurcation is creating fascinating market dynamics. Early-stage companies leveraging AI are achieving significant milestones with far less capital than their predecessors. Meanwhile, Rogers points out a crucial challenge facing established players: \\\"Incumbent and later-stage companies with significant technical debt – sophisticated technology stacks not designed to be AI-native – are beginning to lose major business to earlier stage competitors who can offer more customized solutions at better price points.\\\"\\nWorkforce Innovation and Clinical Impact\\nThe healthcare workforce is undergoing its own revolution. Ryan Schneiter, Managing Director of New Ventures, sees AI technology reshaping how risk-bearing providers approach health outcomes. \\\"We're seeing providers leverage AI for better risk stratification, improved preventative clinical interventions, and enhanced physician productivity,\\\" he explains. \\\"The technology is moving beyond simple task automation to fundamentally changing how clinical teams operate.\\\"\\nThe financial implications are significant, particularly in Revenue Cycle Management. \\\"The true ROI breakthrough lies in AI-driven tools that streamline billing, claims processing, and documentation verification,\\\" Patel notes. \\\"Health systems with significant operational expenses in clinical and non-clinical labor stand to gain substantially from AI adoption, both for productivity gains and, where appropriate, labor optimization.\\\"\\nRegulatory Considerations\\nAs AI becomes more deeply integrated into care delivery and clinical decision support, new challenges are emerging. \\\"Software-as-a-medical-device requirements have come into increased focus,\\\" Schneiter emphasizes. \\\"These requirements will continue to shape how companies approach building AI products and solutions, adding an important layer of complexity to innovation in this space.\\\"\\nLooking Ahead\\nAs we move into 2025, the focus will be on meaningful integration of these emerging technologies. Rogers is particularly optimistic about new opportunities: \\\"As founders and investors better understand AI's capabilities, we expect to see AI enter new healthcare markets with novel offerings while creating new opportunities in traditional sectors where innovation had reached a ceiling without large language models.\\\"\\nThe challenge for healthcare organizations won't be finding AI solutions – it will be selecting the right ones and implementing them effectively. \\\"Success will require not just technological adoption but thoughtful integration that considers workforce impact, clinical workflows, and patient outcomes,\\\" Patel explains. \\\"The organizations that succeed will be those that can navigate this transformation while keeping sight of healthcare's fundamental mission: improving patient outcomes and expanding access to care.\\\"\\nWe continue to be excited by the opportunities ahead and look forward to partnering with innovative companies that are thoughtfully approaching these challenges.\\n</content>\\n\\nMake your judgment and output according to the requirements, determining whether the webpage content can fulfill the purpose of this search round\\n\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"max_tokens\": 8192,\n  \"cache_name\": \"OpenAIApiProxy.call\"\n}"}

They are prioritizing technologies that deliver immediate benefits and holding off on those that aren’t fully developed.\\nAs the managing director and founder of IT Medical, I’ve seen how AI can transform healthcare by enhancing patient outcomes and streamlining clinical workflows. My work in health tech has fueled my passion for using AI to solve real-world challenges.\\nIn this article, I’ll explore five key areas that I believe will become increasingly important in 2025 as organizations adopt AI to achieve meaningful value.\\n1. AI-Driven Genomics For Precision Medicine\\nAI has revolutionized genomic medicine, paving the way for rapid advancements in precision medicine, a key focus for the future. Cancer is recognized as a disease of the genome. However, our inability to effectively manage and analyze large volumes of genomic data has slowed progress across research and clinical applications. AI-driven genomics promises rapid improvements in cancer care by overcoming these challenges.\\nFor instance, a 2024 paper leveraged AI to analyze large genomics and other omics datasets to predict survival outcomes for patients with pancreatic cancer. This demonstrated AI’s ability to generate actionable insights from large volumes of diverse data. Another paper from 2024 used machine learning to identify complex genomic variants associated with psychiatric disorders from standard genomics datasets.\\nThese studies deepen our understanding of individual disease risks and support personalized treatment and prevention strategies.\\n2. Next-Generation Medical Imaging\\nA cornerstone of diagnostics for cancer and other diseases, medical imaging has already benefited enormously from AI-driven processes, and 2025 promises further achievements.\\nA study published in January 2025 demonstrated AI’s real-world, large-scale implementation in medical imaging and its benefits to patient care. The research involved the optional AI-assisted mammography screening of 260,739 women from 463,094 patients. With AI support, radiologists increased breast cancer detection by 17.6% and lowered recall rates. Additionally, the AI group had a higher positive predictive value for recalls than the control group.\\nGE Healthcare’s Roland Rott predicts that “2025 will showcase many more examples of AI’s ability to improve the lives of cancer patients and the care offered by their providers.” AI not only benefits diagnostic accuracy and supports clinical decision making but also enables faster radiology workflows and reduced costs.\\n3. Generative AI For Clinical Documentation And Support\\nTechnological developments like electronic health records (EHR) have improved clinical workflows but have led to problems like clinician burnout and documentation burdens. In 2025, AI promises to help reduce these burdens by providing more accurate and comprehensive support during clinical documentation procedures.\\nAI-powered scribes can lead to a 170% increase in recording speed compared to in-person scribes, and the use of AI for documentation removes the need for manual documentation by clinicians, representing a potential 90% reduction in time spent on administrative tasks.\\nIn a study of more than 100,000 virtual healthcare encounters, clinicians assessed AI-conducted patient interviews and diagnoses. Upon review, they agreed with the AI-generated diagnoses in 84.2% of cases and the top-ranked diagnoses in 60.9% of cases. These results demonstrate AI’s effectiveness in supporting clinical diagnosis in addition to routine documentation tasks.\\n4. Integration of AI And IoMT\\nThe Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is an interconnected system of medical devices and other technologies that track health parameters and monitor patients. First mentioned in 1999, the IoMT has grown to an estimated market value of 97.7% billion in 2025.\\nThe IoMT enables patients to take tests at home, receive reminders to take medicine and allows for real-time monitoring. Wearable technologies are a central pillar of the IoMT, allowing health parameters to be recorded and shared with high accuracy. The data collected by these devices includes but is not limited to blood glucose levels, electrocardiogram readings, skin temperature and respiration rates. This makes them indispensable for tracking chronic diseases such as diabetes and predicting acute health events.\\nFor instance, a randomized controlled trial found that daily remote monitoring of cardiovascular parameters and integrating these data within neural network modeling significantly improved risk stratification and appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) treatments. Another randomized controlled trial found continuous glucose monitoring resulted in a statistically significant reduction in hypoglycemia.\\n5. AI-Driven Remote Patient Monitoring\\nAn essential role of AI lies in remote patient engagement and monitoring. AI-powered assistants mean patients don’t need to rely on non-personalized online information. Instead, they can query symptoms against a personalized system that accounts for their medical history, including recent real-time data.\\nA study found that 90% of patients using AI assistants reported receiving useful information for their health problems and perceived it as a helpful diagnostic tool. A paper from January 2025 established a model called CRAFT-MD for testing the applicability of AI models for patient engagement, medical history tracking and questioning, highlighting areas for improvement as these tools become more widespread within healthcare.\\nUltimately, AI-driven remote patient engagement is poised to significantly enhance personalized healthcare and improve patient outcomes as its applications expand.\\nConclusion\\nIn 2025, AI innovations look set to transform healthcare by facilitating precision medicine, improving diagnostic accuracy, enhancing patient experience and streamlining clinical workflows. Early adopters who leverage AI-driven genomics, next-generation imaging, advanced clinical documentation and integrated IoMT systems are poised to achieve significant ROI and better patient outcomes in 2025.\\nTo adopt AI successfully, focus on areas where it delivers immediate value, like enhancing diagnostics or reducing administrative tasks. Ensure smooth integration with existing systems, invest in staff training to boost AI literacy and choose a provider with proven healthcare AI expertise for reliable, long-term support.\\nAs more healthcare providers embrace these transformative AI solutions, the industry stands on the brink of a new era marked by efficiency, innovation and improved health.\\nForbes Technology Council is an invitation-only com...Omiting #233 chars\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"max_tokens\": 8192,\n  \"cache_name\": \"OpenAIApiProxy.call\"\n}"}

In my world, this is an opportunity to think about the care continuum and how we can foster strong clinician-patient relationships, build on achievements and address areas that need improvement.\\nThe healthcare sector is constantly evolving, with advancements largely driven by technology—particularly AI—alongside a heightened emphasis on patient-centered care. As AI continues its integration into healthcare, the conversation has shifted from potential to practical impact as we gain a clearer understanding of its advantages and challenges. In 2025, healthcare organizations and technology companies should consider these three things when embracing AI and generative AI (GenAI) to support a more efficient, accurate and patient-centered ecosystem.\\nAI Hitting The Mark In Some Areas Of Healthcare\\nWhen considering the integration of technology in healthcare, the priority is ensuring that clinicians receive the right information, in the right channels, at the right time. Clinicians seek speed when it comes to accessing accurate information and answers, as delays can directly impact care and, ultimately, patient outcomes. These fundamental principles help maximize the relevance and impact of clinical decision support, ensuring that information is received in a clear, actionable way at the moment when it’s needed most.\\nAI has identified new opportunities for healthcare organizations, and the focus has been on assessing how we’re adding value today. The applications are broad, from streamlining non-clinical administrative tasks to serving as a second set of eyes in the diagnostic process and lowering operational costs, among other things–all with an eye toward enhancing efficiencies and helping clinicians. Looking ahead, with care teams managing more patients than ever, dependable tools that help them with clinical decision making will be invaluable and should continue to be a focus.\\nA Bright Spot: Alleviating Clinician Burnout\\nAI holds significant potential in helping reduce clinician burnout, which remains a critical issue driving the healthcare workforce shortage. Burnout contributes to high turnover rates, which places greater strain on the remaining staff, perpetuating the cycle. For patients, clinician burnout can lead to decreased quality of care, longer wait times and increased healthcare costs.\\nImproving day-to-day workflows to maximize clinician efficiency is key. Health systems can enhance provider satisfaction by reducing time-consuming tasks such as notetaking, reimbursement, and documentation, therefore reducing pajama time or after-hours work. Intuitive, contextual and responsible content enhances provider satisfaction and enables effective patient communication. For example, ambient AI and other clinician benefits like EHR UI applications have been recognized as game-changers for clinicians. I believe these solutions will continue to evolve in the coming year and show promise in enabling better patient-clinician interactions and combating burnout.\\nThe Path To Clinical Readiness For GenAI\\nGenAI shows potential for supporting clinical decisions, yet its full adoption depends on healthcare providers’ confidence in the reliability and rigor of its underlying data and recommendations. I don't see this confidence quite there yet in the patient care setting, as there are reliability concerns relating to underlying content sets. In one survey, 91% of U.S. physicians indicated wanting to know clinical AI is sourced from medical experts. GenAI inaccuracies, or \\\"hallucinations\\\"—where models may produce incorrect or misleading information—underscore the need for reliable data and precision with a human in the loop.\\nConcerns are likely to arise the closer GenAI gets to the patient in the care continuum. Provider hesitancy reflects the priority for high-quality, consistent information that meets the critical standards required in patient care, which begins by identifying what responsible GenAI looks like. We must balance our excitement with caution when it comes to implementing GenAI in a healthcare setting. Human involvement builds patient trust, which is a vital component of patient adherence and satisfaction. Trusted clinical decision support content, when combined with active clinician involvement, is the only way forward.\\nConclusion\\nOverall, I've noticed a general sense of optimism about the future of technology in healthcare. Realizing the benefits of AI in its various forms will rely on exploring current perceptions and taking advantage of opportunities to build trust in, and understanding of, this evolving technology.\\nAs we embrace the innovations sparked by technology, the dual benefits of time savings and improved accuracy will work to enhance the landscape of patient care, paving the way for a more efficient and effective healthcare environment. The focus on reliable clinical decision support tools in 2025 will be a vital component to improving care for all.\\nReal action is needed from the entire healthcare ecosystem to develop and adopt tools that maintain clinical excellence while prioritizing innovative collaborations. Patients deserve the best care and support possible this year and every year.\\nForbes Business Council is the foremost growth and networking organization for business owners and leaders.

I don't see this confidence quite there yet in the patient care setting, as there are reliability concerns relating to underlying content sets. In one survey, 91% of U.S. physicians indicated wanting to know clinical AI is sourced from medical experts. GenAI inaccuracies, or \\\"hallucinations\\\"—where models may produce incorrect or misleading information—underscore the need for reliable data and precision with a human in the loop.\\nConcerns are likely to arise the closer GenAI gets to the patient in the care continuum. Provider hesitancy reflects the priority for high-quality, consistent information that meets the critical standards required in patient care, which begins by identifying what responsible GenAI looks like. We must balance our excitement with caution when it comes to implementing GenAI in a healthcare setting. Human involvement builds patient trust, which is a vital component of patient adherence and satisfaction. Trusted clinical decision support content, when combined with active clinician involvement, is the only way forward.\\nConclusion\\nOverall, I've noticed a general sense of optimism about the future of technology in healthcare. Realizing the benefits of AI in its various forms will rely on exploring current perceptions and taking advantage of opportunities to build trust in, and understanding of, this evolving technology.\\nAs we embrace the innovations sparked by technology, the dual benefits of time savings and improved accuracy will work to enhance the landscape of patient care, paving the way for a more efficient and effective healthcare environment. The focus on reliable clinical decision support tools in 2025 will be a vital component to improving care for all.\\nReal action is needed from the entire healthcare ecosystem to develop and adopt tools that maintain clinical excellence while prioritizing innovative collaborations. Patients deserve the best care and support possible this year and every year.\\nForbes Business Council is the foremost growth and networking organization for business owners and leaders.

Given the scope of the topic (covering three major areas of healthcare) and the report requirements for comprehensive coverage, this would likely require:\\n- Introduction section\\n- Section on AI in diagnosis\\n- Section on AI in treatment planning\\n- Section on AI impact on patient outcomes\\n- Conclusion section\\nTotal expected length would exceed 1500 words, requiring breakdown\\n\\nSince all three types of sub-tasks are needed, this is clearly a complex task that requires further planning.\\n---\\n\\nOverall plan:\\n```\\n{'id': '', 'task_type': 'write', 'goal': 'Write a simple report on the impact of artificial intelligence on healthcare, focusing on diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient outcomes.', 'dependency': [], 'finish': False, 'is_current_to_plan_task': True, 'sub_tasks': []}\\n```\\n---\\n\\nResults of analysis tasks completed:\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n```\\n---\\n\\n\\nAlready-written report content:\\n```\\n\\n```\\n---\\n\\n# Overall Introduction\\nYou are a recursive professional report-writing and information seeking planning expert, specializing in planning professional report writing based on in-depth research、search and analysis. A high-level plan tailored to the user's knowledge problem-solving needs is already in place, and your task is to further recursively plan the specified writing sub-tasks within this framework. Through your planning, the resulting report will strictly adhere to user requirements and achieve perfection in terms of analysis, logic, and content depth.\\n\\n1. Continue the recursive planning for the specified professional report-writing sub-tasks. According to research and analysis theories, break down the organization of report writing and the results of analysis tasks into more granular writing sub-tasks, specifying their scope and specific writing content.\\n2. Plan analysis sub-tasks and search sub-tasks as needed to assist and support specific writing. Analysis sub-tasks can include tasks such as designing outlines, detailed outlines, data analysis, information organization, logic structure building, and key argument determination to support actual writing. Search sub-tasks are responsible for gathering necessary information and data from internet.\\n3. For each task, plan a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of sub-tasks, where the edges represent dependency relationships between search and analysis tasks within the same layer of the DAG. Recursively plan each sub-task until all sub-tasks become atomic tasks.\\n\\n# Task Types\\n## Writing (Core, Actual Writing)\\n- **Function**: Perform actual report-writing tasks in sequence according to the plan. Based on specific writing requirements and already written content, continue writing in conjunction with the conclusions of analysis tasks and search tasks.\\n- **All writing tasks are continuation tasks**: Ensure continuity and logical consistency with the preceding content during planning. Writing tasks should flow smoothly and seamlessly with one another, maintaining the overall coherence and unity of the report.\\n- **Breakable tasks**: Writing, Analysis, Search\\n- Unless necessary, each writing sub-task should be > 500 words.\\n\\n## Analysis  \\n- **Function**: Analyze and design any requirements outside of actual report writing. This includes but is not limited to research plan design, designing outlines, detailed outlines, data analysis, information organization, logic structure building, key argument determination, etc., to support actual writing.\\n- **Breakable tasks**: Analysis, Search\\n\\n## Search  \\n- **Function**: Perform information-gathering tasks, including collecting necessary data, materials, and information from internet to support analysis and writing tasks.\\n- **Breakable tasks**: Search\\n\\n# Planning Tips  \\n1. The last sub-task derived from a writing task must always be a writing task.  \\n2. Reasonably control the number of sub-tasks in each layer of the DAG, **generally 3–5 sub-tasks**. If the number of tasks exceeds this range, aim to plan recursively. **Do not planning over 8 sub-tasks in one layer.**\\n3. **Analysis tasks** and **search tasks** can serve as **sub-tasks of writing tasks**, more analysis sub-tasks and search sub-tasks should be generated to enhance the quality of writing.  \\n4. Use `dependency` to list the IDs of analysis tasks and search tasks within the same-layer DAG. List all potential dependencies as comprehensively as possible.\\n5. **When an analysis sub-task involves designing specific writing structures, subsequent dependent writing tasks should not be flatten, it should be recursived. e.g., write xxx acorrding to the structure.**. Never forget it.\\n6. **Do not redundantly plan tasks already covered in the `overall plan` or duplicate content already present in the `already written report content`, and previous analysis tasks.**  \\n7. Follow the results of analysis tasks and search tasks.\\n8. search tasks goal only specify the information requirements, do not specify the source or specify how to search.\\n**9**. Unless specified by user, the length of each writing task should be > 500 words.\\n\\n# Task Attributes (Required)  \\n1. **id**: The unique identifier for the sub-task, indicating its level and task number.  \\n2. **goal**: A precise and complete description of the sub-task goal in string format.  \\n3. **dependency**: A list of IDs of search and analysis tasks tasks within the same-layer DAG that this task depends on. List all potential dependencies as comprehensively as possible. If there are no dependent sub-tasks, this should be empty.  \\n4. **task_type**: A string indicating the type of task. Writing tasks are labeled as `write`, analysis tasks are labeled as `think`, and search tasks are labeled as `search`.  \\n5. **length**: For writing tasks, this attribute specifies the scope. It is required for writing tasks. Analysis tasks and search tasks do not require this attribute.  \\n6. **sub_tasks**: A JSON list representing the sub-task DAG. Each element in the list is a JSON object representing a task.\\n\\n# Example\\n<example index=1>\\nUser-given writing task:\\n{\\n    \\\"id\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n    \\\"task_type\\\": \\\"write\\\",\\n    \\\"goal\\\": \\\"Generate a detailed business biography to document DeepSeek's rise\\\",\\n    \\\"length\\\": \\\"8600 words\\\"\\n}\\n\\nA partially complete recursive global plan is provided as a reference, represented in a recursively nested JSON structure.

Recognizing the rapid advancement of AI technologies and their potential to transform healthcare delivery, we propose a set of guidelines emphasizing fairness, robustness, privacy, safety, transparency, explainability, accountability, and benefit. Through a multidisciplinary collaboration, we developed and operationalized these guidelines within a healthcare system, highlighting a case study on ambient documentation to demonstrate the practical application and challenges of implementing generative AI in clinical environments. Our proposed framework ensures continuous monitoring, evaluation, and adaptation of AI technologies, addressing ethical considerations and enhancing patient care. This work contributes to the discourse on responsible AI use in healthcare, offering a blueprint for institutions to navigate the complexities of AI integration responsibly and effectively, thus promoting better, more equitable healthcare outcomes.\\nSimilar content being viewed by others\\nIntroduction\\nThe integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into medicine has advanced markedly, initially making significant strides in medical imaging domains such as radiology, dermatology, pathology, and gastroenterology1. Deep learning models have shown remarkable capabilities, from detecting malignant breast lesions in X-rays2 to identifying diabetic retinopathy in fundus imaging3 and lung nodules in computed tomography scans4, among other applications. Beyond imaging, these models show promise in enhancing clinical decision-making, providing treatment recommendations, and facilitating patient triage5,6,7.\\nThe advent of large language models (LLMs) has further expanded AI’s potential in healthcare, showing the potential to improve tasks such as history taking, patient summarization, generation of discharge summaries, procedural coding, and even provision of diagnostic recommendations8.\\nAs with other healthcare technologies—such as electronic health records, clinical decision support, and telemedicine—large language models necessitate scrutiny, validation, and ongoing safety monitoring. Beyond past considerations such as usability, patient privacy, workflow adaptation, and training procedures9, AI presents a new set of challenges, such as variability in model performance across different healthcare settings due to out-of-distribution shifts, performance changes over time due to evolving disease prevalence, changes in patient demographics, and the introduction of new medical technologies10,11. LLMs, in particular, face heightened scrutiny over their capacity to generate inaccurate or irrelevant content, the risk of fabricating non-existent information (hallucinations), omitting crucial details in the documentation, and navigating data privacy intricacies during training phases12,13.\\nIn response to these rapid developments, regulatory bodies like the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have begun to adapt quickly. However, clear benchmarks for assessing AI models and monitoring their performance over time remain elusive. Leading entities, including the Office of the National Coordinator14, the White House’s AI Bill of Rights blueprint15,16, the Coalition for Health AI (CHAI)17, the World Health Organization18, corporations such as Microsoft19, and professional associations like the American Medical Association20, have begun to establish high-level guidelines. These guidelines emphasize transparency, accountability, equity, privacy, security, safety, reliability, and robustness in AI applications. Despite these efforts, a tangible gap exists in the practical implementation of these guidelines and ongoing oversight of AI within healthcare settings.\\nTo bridge this gap, we have developed a comprehensive set of guidelines that encompasses the entire range of AI systems within healthcare, ranging from traditional machine learning models to advanced generative AI technologies. By presenting a detailed case study on the application of this framework to ambient documentation, we emphasize the practicality and immediate relevance of our methodology. Our goal is to provide a foundational blueprint for healthcare institutions, ensuring AI is integrated responsibly and effectively across the healthcare sector.\\nMethods\\nCrafting guidelines for AI integration in healthcare settings\\nWe brought together a cross-functional team of 18 people from our integrated academic healthcare system, including leaders from informatics, legal, research, data analytics, privacy, patient experience, equity, quality, and safety. We first identified critical themes through a peer-reviewed and gray literature search using terms like “AI governance in healthcare”, “AI guidelines/implementations”. Based on this search and our expert consensus approach (using Delphi-like methodology), we focused on nine principles: (1) Fairness, (2) Equity, (3) Robustness, (4) Privacy, (5) Safety, (6) Transparency, (7) Explainability, (8) Accountability, and (9) Benefit (summarized in Table 1). Additionally, recognizing the importance of collaboration across healthcare organizations for AI assurance to ensure AI ethics are upheld collectively, avoiding duplication of efforts, and enhancing AI implementation quality, we worked with other healthcare institutions and participated in industry collaborations.\\nTo delve further into specifics, we established three focused groups to refine our guidelines: (1) Fairness and Privacy; (2) Transparency, Accountability, and Benefit; and (3) Robustness and Safety, each group had 4, 7, and 5 expert members respectively These insights were integrated into official guidelines for AI governance, incorporating appropriate considerations across institutional stakeholders (Fig. 1).\\nOperationalizing AI deployment guidelines\\nFollowing the establishment of comprehensive AI integration guidelines, our focus shifted toward the development and execution of a structured framework to facilitate their application within the healthcare setting. This effort was co-led by the innovation, digital, and data science teams.\\nOur AI deployment guidelines had to mirror these teams’ existing protocols yet also consider the unique considerations of AI technologies across the Mass General Brigham (MGB) system. We adapted the standard digital work intake and created a specialized technology assessment tool. Our standard intake process evaluates project alignment with organizational priorities and digital strategy, technical feasibility, resource requirements, and project leadership assignments. The specialized assessment tool was specifically designed to address the distinct aspects of AI applications, such as the datasets employed for training and validation, development methods, performance evaluation metrics, potential risks, limitations, and ongoing monitoring parameters.\\nThe preliminary evaluation stage culminates in a consultative session with the respective vendor or research team. This meeting is pivotal, allowing for an in-depth discussion on the proposed metrics, the frequency and nature of model updates, monitoring and the formulation of a strategy for the subsequent shadow deployment phase. The shadow deployment phase allows the AI systems to operate parallel to existing workflows without impacting patient care, allowing for a real-time evaluation and optimization of the technology under act...Omiting #18680 chars\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"max_tokens\": 8192,\n  \"cache_name\": \"OpenAIApiProxy.call\"\n}"}

Image: Unsplash/Accuray\\n- Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming healthcare by improving diagnostic accuracy, enabling earlier disease detection and enhancing patient outcomes.\\n- Effective and ethical AI solutions in healthcare require collaboration among AI engineers, data scientists, domain experts, and other stakeholders, which results in more effective AI models.\\n- AI-driven diagnostics are democratizing healthcare by making early and accurate diagnoses more accessible, especially in regions with limited access to specialized medical professionals.\\nThe healthcare sector is poised for a revolution, with artificial intelligence (AI) playing a pivotal role in transforming how we diagnose and treat diseases.\\nAI’s ability to process vast amounts of data quickly and accurately is reshaping the landscape, offering new ways to improve health outcomes globally.\\nHowever, building effective and accurate solutions that are culturally sensitive and inclusive requires collaboration across the plethora of needed skill sets. The result is better and faster access to health solutions.\\nThe promise of AI in healthcare\\nAI’s potential in healthcare is vast, ranging from predictive analytics and personalized treatment plans to improving diagnostic accuracy. The sheer volume of medical data generated daily – from patient records, clinical trials, medical imaging and wearable devices – can be overwhelming for human practitioners.\\nAs AI can analyze and learn from this data, patterns and correlations that may go unnoticed by human eyes can be detected. This leads to earlier and more accurate diagnoses, which is crucial in improving patient outcomes.\\nOne of the most promising areas of AI in healthcare is in diagnostics. Traditional diagnostic methods often rely on the subjective interpretation of medical professionals, which can sometimes result in variability in outcomes. AI can reduce this variability by providing consistent, data-driven insights, leading to more reliable diagnoses.\\nCollaboration key to robust AI healthcare\\nCollaboration in AI development is essential for creating effective, ethical and impactful solutions to the world’s most pressing challenges, whether that includes AI engineers, data scientists and domain experts. “Such kind of collaboration across people from different sectors and regions help build more ethical and trustworthy AI solutions,” says Rudradeb Mitra, CEO of Omdena, a collaborative AI platform.\\nIn the healthcare sector, Omdena applies AI to diagnostic processes, particularly in underserved communities. These models assist medical professionals in identifying diseases more accurately – such as tuberculosis and diabetic retinopathy – and at earlier stages, thereby increasing the chances of successful treatment.\\nThese projects involve training AI algorithms on large datasets of medical images. Taking a collaborative approach ensures that the AI models are robust, culturally sensitive and adaptable to various healthcare settings.\\nThe World Economic Forum is also driving digital healthcare transformation by fostering a global, multi-stakeholder approach to accelerate the responsible integration of digital health solutions into healthcare systems worldwide.\\nBy collaborating with governments, businesses and civil society, the Forum focuses on improving healthcare access, outcomes and equity through innovative technologies while addressing challenges such as data privacy, cybersecurity and ethical use of AI in healthcare.\\nBy integrating AI models into healthcare systems, particularly in regions with limited access to specialized medical professionals, we can democratize healthcare and ensure that more people have access to early and accurate diagnoses.\\nImpact on health outcomes\\nEarly diagnosis is often the key to successful treatment. Diseases like cancer, for example, have a significantly higher survival rate when detected early. When breast cancer is detected at stage one, the five-year survival rate is over 90%. Colorectal cancer yields a 14% five-year survival rate when diagnosed in later stages but can be around 90% with early diagnosis. Therefore, the impact of AI-driven diagnostics on health outcomes cannot be overstated.\\n“This not only improves patient outcomes but also makes healthcare more accessible to all and reduces the burden on healthcare systems by preventing the progression of diseases to more advanced stages, which are often more difficult and expensive to treat,” says Mitra.\\nFor example, Omdena's AI-powered app in Liberia predicts malaria outbreaks and identifies high-risk areas, enabling health officials to take proactive measures, particularly for vulnerable groups such as children and pregnant women.\\nAI is also transforming oncology by enabling personalized cancer treatments through genomic analysis, identifying mutations and tailoring therapies to a patient's unique cancer profile. This approach improves treatment efficacy, reduces side effects and accelerates drug discovery.\\nAI has also been used in the early detection and prediction of cardiovascular diseases. Machine learning is used to analyse ECGs, medical imaging, and patient data. With studies having shown impressive accuracy rates, including of heart disease classification of 93%, AI is improving diagnostics and offering noninvasive methods for assessing cardiovascular risks, potentially saving lives.\\nThe future of AI in healthcare\\nAs AI continues to evolve, its role in healthcare will only become more critical. The ability to predict, diagnose and treat diseases with greater accuracy and efficiency will lead to healthier populations and more sustainable healthcare systems.\\nWe at Omdena have seen how important collaboration and innovation are in realizing AI’s full potential in healthcare.\\nHowever, the mission is not just to build AI models; it’s about creating solutions that are inclusive, equitable and capable of making a real difference in people’s lives.\\nBy leveraging the power of AI for diagnostics, we can improve health outcomes and contribute to a future where healthcare is more accessible and effective for everyone, particularly in the communities that need it the most.\\nDon't miss any update on this topic\\nCreate a free account and access your personalized content collection with our latest publications and analyses.\\nLicense and Republishing\\nWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.\\nThe views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum.\\nStay up to date:\\nArtificial Intelligence\\nRelated topics:\\nForum Stories newsletter\\nBringing you weekly curated insights and analysis on the global issues that matter.\\n</content>\\n\\nMake your judgment and output according to the requirements, determining whether the webpage content can fulfill the purpose of this search round\\n\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"max_tokens\": 8192,\n  \"cache_name\": \"OpenAIApiProxy.call\"\n}"}

Introduction\\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare, exploiting machine learning (ML) algorithms, data analytics, and automation, is enduring a paradigm transition by improving medical decision‐making, diagnosis, and treatment outcomes, with the potential to boost productivity, care quality, and ease costs [1]. The delivery, administration, and patient experience of healthcare are all being completely transformed by the advancement of AI‐driven technology and further its integration into existing systems [2, 3]. This in‐depth study looks at how AI is significantly impacting the healthcare sector, improving diagnostic precision through data analysis, streamlining treatment planning through predictive algorithms, and shedding light on how these advancements are challenging accepted wisdom and setting new benchmarks for quality [3, 4, 5]. Najjar (2023) showcased AI's revolutionary potential in several healthcare sectors. In diagnostics, AI‐powered diagnostic tools have shown remarkable accuracy in diagnosing diseases including cancer, heart issues, and neurological disorders, particularly in the area of medical imaging. These technologies frequently outperform human clinicians in this regard [6]. Their speed and precision have frequently surpassed that of human professionals. ML algorithms scan vast amounts of data from imaging studies, genomes, and medical records to identify patterns and predict patient outcomes, enabling earlier and more accurate diagnosis [4]. In addition to improving patient outcomes, AI‐powered expertise enables personalized treatment plans that cater to each patient's unique requirements and boost the effectiveness of treatments [5, 6]. By analyzing patient data to suggest tailored medication, AI improves treatment success and minimizes side effects [4, 5, 6]. These technologies can reduce hospital admissions and readmissions by remotely monitoring patients and alerting medical professionals to issues before they get worse [2, 3]. According to Alowais et al. (2023), AI is also greatly enhancing patient care and administrative effectiveness. Virtual health assistants driven by ML and NLP are increasingly being used to plan appointments, handle patient communications, and provide medical advice, all of which reduce the workload for medical staff [7]. Healthcare facilities operate more effectively, and resources are directed where they are most needed because to AI's capacity to manage massive information and optimize workflows [7]. By optimizing treatment plans, getting rid of unnecessary procedures, and improving diagnosis accuracy, AI has the potential to significantly reduce healthcare expenditures. Bajwa et. al. (2021) touched on one of the main factors influencing AI's adoption is its ability to lower healthcare expenses [1]. One of the primary drivers of AI adoption, according to Bajwa et al. (2021), is its potential to reduce healthcare costs [1]. Predictive analytics is a significant use of AI in healthcare that supports patient demand forecasting, population health management, and resource allocation. Since early detection and tailored treatment can prevent costly outcomes and hospital admissions, these qualities are particularly beneficial in the management of chronic illnesses [1, 3, 7].\\nAI in healthcare must overcome several significant challenges if it is to live up to its full potential. Ethical concerns such as safeguarding patient privacy and avoiding bias in AI systems must be taken into consideration. There are concerns about data security and potential misuse because AI systems rely on massive amounts of data [3]. To ensure that the highest safety and efficacy standards are fulfilled and to oversee the development and use of AI technology in healthcare, robust regulatory frameworks are also necessary [8].\\nAdditionally, for the healthcare industry to adopt AI, a cultural shift must occur. By automating processes like scheduling, billing, and patient triage and allocating resources optimally to cut down on wait times and enhance workflow overall, AI also increases operational competence [1, 3, 5]. Healthcare professionals must understand the benefits and drawbacks of AI technology and be ready to handle them. Collaboration between AI developers, healthcare practitioners, and legislators is essential to the development of systems that are not just technologically advanced but also aligned with the needs and values of patients and providers [7]. To enable prompt reactions, AI‐driven surveillance systems use ML algorithms to identify trends and early warning indicators of disease outbreaks [9, 58]. AI models forecast epidemics and track the spread of diseases like influenza, monkeypox, chikungunya and COVID‐19 by analyzing symptoms, travel records, and environmental data [6, 7, 8], helping public health officials allocate resources, implement prevention strategies, and tackle emergent health threats [3, 7].\\nAt the outset, AI is more than just a technological advancement—it is what is propelling the advancement of healthcare.

Introduction\\nBackground the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has brought revolutionary changes in major healthcare sectors, with improved tools and innovative ways for diagnosis and patient management. AI has shown a lot of promise in the field of neurology in the present day as regards both complex neurological disorder diagnosis and treatment. For instance, healthcare providers are tremendously challenged by neurological disorders due to stroke, traumatic brain injuries, epilepsy, among other acute situations, because of their complex nature and timely intervention needed in these cases. This is even more critical in emergent cases, where rapid and accurate diagnosis is needed for the right intervention on a patient. The application of AI in neurology is an extrapolation of successes made in other general areas of medicine, where large datasets have been analyzed by machine learning algorithms, neural networks, and other AI technologies to help predict outcomes and guide clinical decision-making. AI’s ability to process vast volumes of information quickly and accurately makes it a potent tool in the emerging diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders, where time plays a critical role (1).\\nProblem Statement Although there have been enormous advancements in medical imaging, clinical protocols, and pharmacological treatments, timely diagnosis and effective treatment of emergent neurological conditions remains a herculean task. Also, traditional diagnostic methods are usually very time-consuming and require a lot of expertise, such as experience and, for the said reason, may not be easily accessed in case of an emergency (44). Similarly, complex neurological disorder treatments need to be customized for individual patients, making standard approaches less effective. AI has in it the potential to bridge these gaps with real-time diagnostic support and customizing treatment plans, based on huge datasets and predictive modeling. While this is its potential, AI is only at the very early stages of actual practice applications, such as emergent neurological cases. Current advancements are in need of comprehensive scrutiny due to the state of the field in the diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders with AI, which suggests specific places for further method development and research.\\nWhile the advancements in AI for neurological care are promising, it is critical to acknowledge gaps in the current literature. Many existing reviews provide a broad overview of AI applications but fail to focus on emergent neurological situations where time-sensitive interventions are paramount. This article aims to fill that gap by reviewing the specific role of AI in diagnosing and managing acute neurological emergencies such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, and acute spinal cord injury. Moreover, prior reviews have not sufficiently discussed the ethical and practical challenges of integrating AI into real-world clinical settings, especially in low-resource environments. This comprehensive review will address these overlooked areas, providing a nuanced perspective on future research directions.\\nAims the primary intention of the literature review is to assess the current state of AI-assisted diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders, with a particular focus on emergent cases. This review shall hence strive to:\\nDiscuss recent developments in AI technologies relevant to emergent neurological disease diagnosis and treatment.\\nEvaluate how well AI applications improve patient outcomes in the emergency setting.\\nHighlight challenges and limitations in the implementation of AI in neurology.\\nMake recommendations for future research and clinical practice.\\nA well-structured review of this topic is essential to facilitate a clear understanding of AI’s transformative potential in neurology. This review will follow a systematic format to ensure coherence and clarity, covering recent technological developments, clinical applications, and the ethical implications of using AI in emergent neurological cases. By structuring the discussion around specific neurological emergencies, this review avoids the pitfalls of other articles that lack focus and cohesion. Additionally, we aim to highlight the limitations of current AI applications, thereby setting the stage for targeted research that can address these shortcomings in a meaningful way.\\nPurpose and Usefulness As previously outlined, this literature review will cover studies published in the last 8 years that echo the most recent advances in AI and its applications in neurology. This review, therefore, looks at AI tools aiding in diagnoses, treatment planning, and management strategies for dealing with emergent cases of neurological disorders. Since there is an increased need for timely and accurate interventions in emergent cases, this review will focus on the role of AI on patient outcomes during such incidences (2).\\n2.

Techniques like the under sampling clustering oversampling method (USCOM) address the issue of data imbalance, thereby improving the model’s predictive capabilities. The classification challenge employs a multilayer deep convolutional neural network (MLDCNN), trained using the adaptive elephant herd optimization method (AEHOM). The proposed machine learning-based heart disease prediction method (ML-HDPM) demonstrates outstanding performance across various crucial evaluation parameters, as indicated by its comprehensive assessment. During the training process, the ML-HDPM model exhibits a high level of performance, achieving an accuracy rate of 95.5% and a precision rate of 94.8%. The system’s sensitivity (recall) performs with a high accuracy rate of 96.2%, while the F-score highlights its well-balanced performance, measuring 91.5%. It is worth noting that the specificity of ML-HDPM is recorded at a remarkable 89.7%. The findings underscore the potential of ML-HDPM to transform the prediction of heart disease and aid healthcare practitioners in providing precise diagnoses, exerting a substantial influence on patient care outcomes.\\nSimilar content being viewed by others\\nIntroduction\\nHealthcare encompasses a range of disciplines.

The management of the condition involves a comprehensive approach encompassing lifestyle adjustments, pharmaceutical therapies, and surgical procedures, highlighting the need for interdisciplinary cooperation among healthcare professionals. Healthcare efforts that prioritize the promotion of heart-healthy habits, the enhancement of perception, and the advocacy for early detection play a crucial role in mitigating the prevalence of heart disease and enhancing cardiovascular well-being on a broader scope. Examining and controlling cardiovascular disease exemplify the complex interaction between healthcare and the welfare of people and society5.\\nCardiovascular disorders rank first among the most lethal illnesses. They are well recognized as a significant contributor to mortality on a worldwide scale6. Based on statistical data from the World Health Organization, it was reported that cardiac disorders were responsible for about 18 million fatalities in 2016. In the United States, cardiovascular illnesses, including heart disease, hypertension, and stroke, are the leading causes of mortality. Cardiovascular heart disease (CHD) is responsible for about one-seventh of all fatalities in the United States, resulting in an estimated yearly death toll of 3 million individuals7. The prevalence of myocardial infarctions in the United States is roughly 7.9 million, accounting for approximately 3% of heart attack incidents among American adults.

A medical diagnosis is the identification of the disease or conditions that cause a person’s symptoms and signs. Usually, the patient’s medical history and physical examination provide diagnostic information. Diagnosing a medical condition can be difficult because many symptoms are ambiguous and can only be correctly identified by trained healthcare professionals. This can be a major problem in developing countries where doctors and other health professionals are scarce. Many people in these countries cannot get proper medical diagnosis and treatment for lack of healthcare professionals [2]. AI could be helpful for undeveloped regions [3]. The AI-based system [4, 5] is able to detect various diseases, such as kidney stone detection [6], heart disease prediction and detection [7], skin and lung cancer detection [8, 9], diabetes prediction and detection [10]. Recently, AI-based systems have played an important role in the correct diagnosis of COVID-19 [11, 12].\\nA branch of artificial intelligence called “ML” focuses on creating algorithms that allow computers to learn from data and make predictions. It is based on the idea that systems can automatically get better at a task over time by gaining experience and processing lots of data. Recent advances in ML technology have enabled computers to process and understand information on a par with humans. In some cases, these systems can recognize patterns and extract information with greater accuracy than trained experts. This is a significant step forward, as it demonstrates the ability of machines to process and understand complex information in new and novel ways. ML has become a powerful tool due to improvements in classical statistical modeling techniques, large amounts of data, growth in computing power, and advanced algorithm design [13]. ML algorithms can be trained on large datasets of medical images such as radiographs and MRI scans [14], to identify signs of disease or abnormalities. There are two types of problems in ML, classification and regression. Classification is predicting an outcome from a set of data, while regression is showing the relationship between dependent and independent variables.\\nWhile ML algorithms have been proven to be valuable tools in medical diagnosis [15, 16], it is essential to recognize that they should not replace human expertise and judgment. ML algorithms rely on the data they have been trained on and may not consider all relevant factors in the diagnostic process. Additionally, these algorithms are not infallible and can make errors. Therefore, it is crucial for healthcare professionals to exercise caution, review, and verify the results generated by ML systems to ensure accurate and reliable diagnoses. The integration of ML into healthcare can be considered as a collaborative approach that combines the strengths of both algorithms and human expertise to achieve the best possible outcomes for patients.\\n1.1 Motivation\\nThe main purpose of this thorough review is to provide a helpful guide for upcoming researchers, especially those who want to explore the unused possibilities of using ML for detecting diseases at an early stage. By delving deep into the application of ML algorithms across a diverse spectrum of diseases, this review endeavors to provide critical insights into the most effective strategies for early detection, thereby propelling the realm of medical diagnostics into a new era of precision and proactive care. In this pursuit, the review will address pivotal questions that hold paramount importance for researchers venturing into the realm of ML-powered early disease diagnosis. It is poised to be a beacon, illuminating crucial pathways for researchers seeking to incorporate ML into their diagnostic arsenal. To achieve this, the review will embark on a threefold exploration.\\nFirstly, it will chart a comprehensive course through the labyrinth of ML-based methods, guiding researchers in the art of applying these algorithms to diagnose a diverse array of diseases. Through a meticulous analysis of existing literature and studies, this section will equip future researchers with the sagacity to harness ML algorithms effectively within an expansive range of medical contexts.\\nSecondly, the review will cast a focused spotlight on five specific diseases: cancer, COVID-19, kidney disease, heart disease, and diabetes. Each of these diseases has been chosen with utmost consideration, reflecting their profound impact on humanity.

Image: Unsplash/Accuray\\n- Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming healthcare by improving diagnostic accuracy, enabling earlier disease detection and enhancing patient outcomes.\\n- Effective and ethical AI solutions in healthcare require collaboration among AI engineers, data scientists, domain experts, and other stakeholders, which results in more effective AI models.\\n- AI-driven diagnostics are democratizing healthcare by making early and accurate diagnoses more accessible, especially in regions with limited access to specialized medical professionals.\\nThe healthcare sector is poised for a revolution, with artificial intelligence (AI) playing a pivotal role in transforming how we diagnose and treat diseases.\\nAI’s ability to process vast amounts of data quickly and accurately is reshaping the landscape, offering new ways to improve health outcomes globally.\\nHowever, building effective and accurate solutions that are culturally sensitive and inclusive requires collaboration across the plethora of needed skill sets. The result is better and faster access to health solutions.\\nThe promise of AI in healthcare\\nAI’s potential in healthcare is vast, ranging from predictive analytics and personalized treatment plans to improving diagnostic accuracy. The sheer volume of medical data generated daily – from patient records, clinical trials, medical imaging and wearable devices – can be overwhelming for human practitioners.\\nAs AI can analyze and learn from this data, patterns and correlations that may go unnoticed by human eyes can be detected. This leads to earlier and more accurate diagnoses, which is crucial in improving patient outcomes.\\nOne of the most promising areas of AI in healthcare is in diagnostics. Traditional diagnostic methods often rely on the subjective interpretation of medical professionals, which can sometimes result in variability in outcomes. AI can reduce this variability by providing consistent, data-driven insights, leading to more reliable diagnoses.\\nCollaboration key to robust AI healthcare\\nCollaboration in AI development is essential for creating effective, ethical and impactful solutions to the world’s most pressing challenges, whether that includes AI engineers, data scientists and domain experts. “Such kind of collaboration across people from different sectors and regions help build more ethical and trustworthy AI solutions,” says Rudradeb Mitra, CEO of Omdena, a collaborative AI platform.\\nIn the healthcare sector, Omdena applies AI to diagnostic processes, particularly in underserved communities. These models assist medical professionals in identifying diseases more accurately – such as tuberculosis and diabetic retinopathy – and at earlier stages, thereby increasing the chances of successful treatment.\\nThese projects involve training AI algorithms on large datasets of medical images. Taking a collaborative approach ensures that the AI models are robust, culturally sensitive and adaptable to various healthcare settings.\\nThe World Economic Forum is also driving digital healthcare transformation by fostering a global, multi-stakeholder approach to accelerate the responsible integration of digital health solutions into healthcare systems worldwide.\\nBy collaborating with governments, businesses and civil society, the Forum focuses on improving healthcare access, outcomes and equity through innovative technologies while addressing challenges such as data privacy, cybersecurity and ethical use of AI in healthcare.\\nBy integrating AI models into healthcare systems, particularly in regions with limited access to specialized medical professionals, we can democratize healthcare and ensure that more people have access to early and accurate diagnoses.\\nImpact on health outcomes\\nEarly diagnosis is often the key to successful treatment. Diseases like cancer, for example, have a significantly higher survival rate when detected early. When breast cancer is detected at stage one, the five-year survival rate is over 90%. Colorectal cancer yields a 14% five-year survival rate when diagnosed in later stages but can be around 90% with early diagnosis. Therefore, the impact of AI-driven diagnostics on health outcomes cannot be overstated.\\n“This not only improves patient outcomes but also makes healthcare more accessible to all and reduces the burden on healthcare systems by preventing the progression of diseases to more advanced stages, which are often more difficult and expensive to treat,” says Mitra.\\nFor example, Omdena's AI-powered app in Liberia predicts malaria outbreaks and identifies high-risk areas, enabling health officials to take proactive measures, particularly for vulnerable groups such as children and pregnant women.\\nAI is also transforming oncology by enabling personalized cancer treatments through genomic analysis, identifying mutations and tailoring therapies to a patient's unique cancer profile. This approach improves treatment efficacy, reduces side effects and accelerates drug discovery.\\nAI has also been used in the early detection and prediction of cardiovascular diseases. Machine learning is used to analyse ECGs, medical imaging, and patient data. With studies having shown impressive accuracy rates, including of heart disease classification of 93%, AI is improving diagnostics and offering noninvasive methods for assessing cardiovascular risks, potentially saving lives.\\nThe future of AI in healthcare\\nAs AI continues to evolve, its role in healthcare will only become more critical. The ability to predict, diagnose and treat diseases with greater accuracy and efficiency will lead to healthier populations and more sustainable healthcare systems.\\nWe at Omdena have seen how important collaboration and innovation are in realizing AI’s full potential in healthcare.\\nHowever, the mission is not just to build AI models; it’s about creating solutions that are inclusive, equitable and capable of making a real difference in people’s lives.\\nBy leveraging the power of AI for diagnostics, we can improve health outcomes and contribute to a future where healthcare is more accessible and effective for everyone, particularly in the communities that need it the most.\\nDon't miss any update on this topic\\nCreate a free account and access your personalized content collection with our latest publications and analyses.\\nLicense and Republishing\\nWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.\\nThe views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum.\\nStay up to date:\\nArtificial Intelligence\\nRelated topics:\\nForum Stories newsletter\\nBringing you weekly curated insights and analysis on the global issues that matter.\\n</content>\\n\\nOrganize and extract as required, focusing solely on the webpage content itself.

Accurately predicting cardiovascular disease poses a significant challenge within clinical data analysis. The present study introduces a prediction model that utilizes various combinations of information and employs multiple established classification approaches. The proposed technique combines the genetic algorithm (GA) and the recursive feature elimination method (RFEM) to select relevant features, thus enhancing the model’s robustness. Techniques like the under sampling clustering oversampling method (USCOM) address the issue of data imbalance, thereby improving the model’s predictive capabilities. The classification challenge employs a multilayer deep convolutional neural network (MLDCNN), trained using the adaptive elephant herd optimization method (AEHOM). The proposed machine learning-based heart disease prediction method (ML-HDPM) demonstrates outstanding performance across various crucial evaluation parameters, as indicated by its comprehensive assessment. During the training process, the ML-HDPM model exhibits a high level of performance, achieving an accuracy rate of 95.5% and a precision rate of 94.8%. The system’s sensitivity (recall) performs with a high accuracy rate of 96.2%, while the F-score highlights its well-balanced performance, measuring 91.5%. It is worth noting that the specificity of ML-HDPM is recorded at a remarkable 89.7%. The findings underscore the potential of ML-HDPM to transform the prediction of heart disease and aid healthcare practitioners in providing precise diagnoses, exerting a substantial influence on patient care outcomes.\\nSimilar content being viewed by others\\nIntroduction\\nHealthcare encompasses a range of disciplines.

Introduction\\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare, exploiting machine learning (ML) algorithms, data analytics, and automation, is enduring a paradigm transition by improving medical decision‐making, diagnosis, and treatment outcomes, with the potential to boost productivity, care quality, and ease costs [1]. The delivery, administration, and patient experience of healthcare are all being completely transformed by the advancement of AI‐driven technology and further its integration into existing systems [2, 3]. This in‐depth study looks at how AI is significantly impacting the healthcare sector, improving diagnostic precision through data analysis, streamlining treatment planning through predictive algorithms, and shedding light on how these advancements are challenging accepted wisdom and setting new benchmarks for quality [3, 4, 5]. Najjar (2023) showcased AI's revolutionary potential in several healthcare sectors. In diagnostics, AI‐powered diagnostic tools have shown remarkable accuracy in diagnosing diseases including cancer, heart issues, and neurological disorders, particularly in the area of medical imaging. These technologies frequently outperform human clinicians in this regard [6]. Their speed and precision have frequently surpassed that of human professionals. ML algorithms scan vast amounts of data from imaging studies, genomes, and medical records to identify patterns and predict patient outcomes, enabling earlier and more accurate diagnosis [4]. In addition to improving patient outcomes, AI‐powered expertise enables personalized treatment plans that cater to each patient's unique requirements and boost the effectiveness of treatments [5, 6]. By analyzing patient data to suggest tailored medication, AI improves treatment success and minimizes side effects [4, 5, 6]. These technologies can reduce hospital admissions and readmissions by remotely monitoring patients and alerting medical professionals to issues before they get worse [2, 3]. According to Alowais et al. (2023), AI is also greatly enhancing patient care and administrative effectiveness. Virtual health assistants driven by ML and NLP are increasingly being used to plan appointments, handle patient communications, and provide medical advice, all of which reduce the workload for medical staff [7]. Healthcare facilities operate more effectively, and resources are directed where they are most needed because to AI's capacity to manage massive information and optimize workflows [7]. By optimizing treatment plans, getting rid of unnecessary procedures, and improving diagnosis accuracy, AI has the potential to significantly reduce healthcare expenditures. Bajwa et. al. (2021) touched on one of the main factors influencing AI's adoption is its ability to lower healthcare expenses [1]. One of the primary drivers of AI adoption, according to Bajwa et al. (2021), is its potential to reduce healthcare costs [1]. Predictive analytics is a significant use of AI in healthcare that supports patient demand forecasting, population health management, and resource allocation. Since early detection and tailored treatment can prevent costly outcomes and hospital admissions, these qualities are particularly beneficial in the management of chronic illnesses [1, 3, 7].\\nAI in healthcare must overcome several significant challenges if it is to live up to its full potential. Ethical concerns such as safeguarding patient privacy and avoiding bias in AI systems must be taken into consideration. There are concerns about data security and potential misuse because AI systems rely on massive amounts of data [3]. To ensure that the highest safety and efficacy standards are fulfilled and to oversee the development and use of AI technology in healthcare, robust regulatory frameworks are also necessary [8].\\nAdditionally, for the healthcare industry to adopt AI, a cultural shift must occur. By automating processes like scheduling, billing, and patient triage and allocating resources optimally to cut down on wait times and enhance workflow overall, AI also increases operational competence [1, 3, 5]. Healthcare professionals must understand the benefits and drawbacks of AI technology and be ready to handle them. Collaboration between AI developers, healthcare practitioners, and legislators is essential to the development of systems that are not just technologically advanced but also aligned with the needs and values of patients and providers [7]. To enable prompt reactions, AI‐driven surveillance systems use ML algorithms to identify trends and early warning indicators of disease outbreaks [9, 58]. AI models forecast epidemics and track the spread of diseases like influenza, monkeypox, chikungunya and COVID‐19 by analyzing symptoms, travel records, and environmental data [6, 7, 8], helping public health officials allocate resources, implement prevention strategies, and tackle emergent health threats [3, 7].\\nAt the outset, AI is more than just a technological advancement—it is what is propelling the advancement of healthcare. Its capacity to transform patient care, diagnostics, and operational effectiveness offers hope for a more individualized, effective, and accessible healthcare system in the future [8]. As AI develops, ethical, legal, and cultural issues must be carefully considered before integrating it into the healthcare industry. By overcoming these obstacles, AI can live up to its potential of revolutionizing healthcare into a more efficient and just system where human judgment and technological know‐how combine to provide better treatment [3, 7].\\nThis review provides a comprehensive analysis of AI's implications for the healthcare sector, emph...Omiting #75629 chars\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"max_tokens\": 8192,\n  \"cache_name\": \"OpenAIApiProxy.call\"\n}"}

Recognizing the rapid advancement of AI technologies and their potential to transform healthcare delivery, we propose a set of guidelines emphasizing fairness, robustness, privacy, safety, transparency, explainability, accountability, and benefit. Through a multidisciplinary collaboration, we developed and operationalized these guidelines within a healthcare system, highlighting a case study on ambient documentation to demonstrate the practical application and challenges of implementing generative AI in clinical environments. Our proposed framework ensures continuous monitoring, evaluation, and adaptation of AI technologies, addressing ethical considerations and enhancing patient care. This work contributes to the discourse on responsible AI use in healthcare, offering a blueprint for institutions to navigate the complexities of AI integration responsibly and effectively, thus promoting better, more equitable healthcare outcomes.\\nSimilar content being viewed by others\\nIntroduction\\nThe integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into medicine has advanced markedly, initially making significant strides in medical imaging domains such as radiology, dermatology, pathology, and gastroenterology1. Deep learning models have shown remarkable capabilities, from detecting malignant breast lesions in X-rays2 to identifying diabetic retinopathy in fundus imaging3 and lung nodules in computed tomography scans4, among other applications. Beyond imaging, these models show promise in enhancing clinical decision-making, providing treatment recommendations, and facilitating patient triage5,6,7.\\nThe advent of large language models (LLMs) has further expanded AI’s potential in healthcare, showing the potential to improve tasks such as history taking, patient summarization, generation of discharge summaries, procedural coding, and even provision of diagnostic recommendations8.\\nAs with other healthcare technologies—such as electronic health records, clinical decision support, and telemedicine—large language models necessitate scrutiny, validation, and ongoing safety monitoring. Beyond past considerations such as usability, patient privacy, workflow adaptation, and training procedures9, AI presents a new set of challenges, such as variability in model performance across different healthcare settings due to out-of-distribution shifts, performance changes over time due to evolving disease prevalence, changes in patient demographics, and the introduction of new medical technologies10,11. LLMs, in particular, face heightened scrutiny over their capacity to generate inaccurate or irrelevant content, the risk of fabricating non-existent information (hallucinations), omitting crucial details in the documentation, and navigating data privacy intricacies during training phases12,13.\\nIn response to these rapid developments, regulatory bodies like the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have begun to adapt quickly. However, clear benchmarks for assessing AI models and monitoring their performance over time remain elusive. Leading entities, including the Office of the National Coordinator14, the White House’s AI Bill of Rights blueprint15,16, the Coalition for Health AI (CHAI)17, the World Health Organization18, corporations such as Microsoft19, and professional associations like the American Medical Association20, have begun to establish high-level guidelines. These guidelines emphasize transparency, accountability, equity, privacy, security, safety, reliability, and robustness in AI applications. Despite these efforts, a tangible gap exists in the practical implementation of these guidelines and ongoing oversight of AI within healthcare settings.\\nTo bridge this gap, we have developed a comprehensive set of guidelines that encompasses the entire range of AI systems within healthcare, ranging from traditional machine learning models to advanced generative AI technologies. By presenting a detailed case study on the application of this framework to ambient documentation, we emphasize the practicality and immediate relevance of our methodology. Our goal is to provide a foundational blueprint for healthcare institutions, ensuring AI is integrated responsibly and effectively across the healthcare sector.\\nMethods\\nCrafting guidelines for AI integration in healthcare settings\\nWe brought together a cross-functional team of 18 people from our integrated academic healthcare system, including leaders from informatics, legal, research, data analytics, privacy, patient experience, equity, quality, and safety. We first identified critical themes through a peer-reviewed and gray literature search using terms like “AI governance in healthcare”, “AI guidelines/implementations”. Based on this search and our expert consensus approach (using Delphi-like methodology), we focused on nine principles: (1) Fairness, (2) Equity, (3) Robustness, (4) Privacy, (5) Safety, (6) Transparency, (7) Explainability, (8) Accountability, and (9) Benefit (summarized in Table 1). Additionally, recognizing the importance of collaboration across healthcare organizations for AI assurance to ensure AI ethics are upheld collectively, avoiding duplication of efforts, and enhancing AI implementation quality, we worked with other healthcare institutions and participated in industry collaborations.\\nTo delve further into specifics, we established three focused groups to refine our guidelines: (1) Fairness and Privacy; (2) Transparency, Accountability, and Benefit; and (3) Robustness and Safety, each group had 4, 7, and 5 expert members respectively These insights were integrated into official guidelines for AI governance, incorporating appropriate considerations across institutional stakeholders (Fig. 1).\\nOperationalizing AI deployment guidelines\\nFollowing the establishment of comprehensive AI integration guidelines, our focus shifted toward the development and execution of a structured framework to facilitate their application within the healthcare setting. This effort was co-led by the innovation, digital, and data science teams.\\nOur AI deployment guidelines had to mirror these teams’ existing protocols yet also consider the unique considerations of AI technologies across the Mass General Brigham (MGB) system. We adapted the standard digital work intake and created a specialized technology assessment tool. Our standard intake process evaluates project alignment with organizational priorities and digital strategy, technical feasibility, resource requirements, and project leadership assignments. The specialized assessment tool was specifically designed to address the distinct aspects of AI applications, such as the datasets employed for training and validation, development methods, performance evaluation metrics, potential risks, limitations, and ongoing monitoring parameters.\\nThe preliminary evaluation stage culminates in a consultative session with the respective vendor or research team. This meeting is pivotal, allowing for an in-depth discussion on the proposed metrics, the frequency and nature of model updates, monitoring and the formulation of a strategy for the subsequent shadow deployment phase. The shadow deployment phase allows the AI systems to operate parallel to existing workflows without impacting patient care, allowing for a real-time evaluation and optimization of the technology under actual working conditions.\\nFollowing the shadow deployment, our evaluation of AI systems encompasses a range of key metrics, ensuring their efficacy and seamless integration into clinical settings. Among these metrics, we prioritize assessing fairness across patient demographics, collecting provider feedback to gauge user experience, and examining workflow integration and usability to assess scalability, cost-effectiveness, clinical impact, and performance stability over time. These metrics provide a framework for evaluating the AI systems’ effectiveness and practicality in real-world healthcare environments.\\nResults\\nEst...Omiting #18139 chars\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"max_tokens\": 8192,\n  \"cache_name\": \"OpenAIApiProxy.call\"\n}"}

Introduction\\nBackground the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has brought revolutionary changes in major healthcare sectors, with improved tools and innovative ways for diagnosis and patient management. AI has shown a lot of promise in the field of neurology in the present day as regards both complex neurological disorder diagnosis and treatment. For instance, healthcare providers are tremendously challenged by neurological disorders due to stroke, traumatic brain injuries, epilepsy, among other acute situations, because of their complex nature and timely intervention needed in these cases. This is even more critical in emergent cases, where rapid and accurate diagnosis is needed for the right intervention on a patient. The application of AI in neurology is an extrapolation of successes made in other general areas of medicine, where large datasets have been analyzed by machine learning algorithms, neural networks, and other AI technologies to help predict outcomes and guide clinical decision-making. AI’s ability to process vast volumes of information quickly and accurately makes it a potent tool in the emerging diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders, where time plays a critical role (1).\\nProblem Statement Although there have been enormous advancements in medical imaging, clinical protocols, and pharmacological treatments, timely diagnosis and effective treatment of emergent neurological conditions remains a herculean task. Also, traditional diagnostic methods are usually very time-consuming and require a lot of expertise, such as experience and, for the said reason, may not be easily accessed in case of an emergency (44). Similarly, complex neurological disorder treatments need to be customized for individual patients, making standard approaches less effective. AI has in it the potential to bridge these gaps with real-time diagnostic support and customizing treatment plans, based on huge datasets and predictive modeling. While this is its potential, AI is only at the very early stages of actual practice applications, such as emergent neurological cases. Current advancements are in need of comprehensive scrutiny due to the state of the field in the diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders with AI, which suggests specific places for further method development and research.\\nWhile the advancements in AI for neurological care are promising, it is critical to acknowledge gaps in the current literature. Many existing reviews provide a broad overview of AI applications but fail to focus on emergent neurological situations where time-sensitive interventions are paramount. This article aims to fill that gap by reviewing the specific role of AI in diagnosing and managing acute neurological emergencies such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, and acute spinal cord injury. Moreover, prior reviews have not sufficiently discussed the ethical and practical challenges of integrating AI into real-world clinical settings, especially in low-resource environments. This comprehensive review will address these overlooked areas, providing a nuanced perspective on future research directions.\\nAims the primary intention of the literature review is to assess the current state of AI-assisted diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders, with a particular focus on emergent cases. This review shall hence strive to:\\nDiscuss recent developments in AI technologies relevant to emergent neurological disease diagnosis and treatment.\\nEvaluate how well AI applications improve patient outcomes in the emergency setting.\\nHighlight challenges and limitations in the implementation of AI in neurology.\\nMake recommendations for future research and clinical practice.\\nA well-structured review of this topic is essential to facilitate a clear understanding of AI’s transformative potential in neurology. This review will follow a systematic format to ensure coherence and clarity, covering recent technological developments, clinical applications, and the ethical implications of using AI in emergent neurological cases. By structuring the discussion around specific neurological emergencies, this review avoids the pitfalls of other articles that lack focus and cohesion. Additionally, we aim to highlight the limitations of current AI applications, thereby setting the stage for targeted research that can address these shortcomings in a meaningful way.\\nPurpose and Usefulness As previously outlined, this literature review will cover studies published in the last 8 years that echo the most recent advances in AI and its applications in neurology. This review, therefore, looks at AI tools aiding in diagnoses, treatment planning, and management strategies for dealing with emergent cases of neurological disorders. Since there is an increased need for timely and accurate interventions in emergent cases, this review will focus on the role of AI on patient outcomes during such incidences (2).\\n2.

A medical diagnosis is the identification of the disease or conditions that cause a person’s symptoms and signs. Usually, the patient’s medical history and physical examination provide diagnostic information. Diagnosing a medical condition can be difficult because many symptoms are ambiguous and can only be correctly identified by trained healthcare professionals. This can be a major problem in developing countries where doctors and other health professionals are scarce. Many people in these countries cannot get proper medical diagnosis and treatment for lack of healthcare professionals [2]. AI could be helpful for undeveloped regions [3]. The AI-based system [4, 5] is able to detect various diseases, such as kidney stone detection [6], heart disease prediction and detection [7], skin and lung cancer detection [8, 9], diabetes prediction and detection [10]. Recently, AI-based systems have played an important role in the correct diagnosis of COVID-19 [11, 12].\\nA branch of artificial intelligence called “ML” focuses on creating algorithms that allow computers to learn from data and make predictions. It is based on the idea that systems can automatically get better at a task over time by gaining experience and processing lots of data. Recent advances in ML technology have enabled computers to process and understand information on a par with humans. In some cases, these systems can recognize patterns and extract information with greater accuracy than trained experts. This is a significant step forward, as it demonstrates the ability of machines to process and understand complex information in new and novel ways. ML has become a powerful tool due to improvements in classical statistical modeling techniques, large amounts of data, growth in computing power, and advanced algorithm design [13]. ML algorithms can be trained on large datasets of medical images such as radiographs and MRI scans [14], to identify signs of disease or abnormalities. There are two types of problems in ML, classification and regression. Classification is predicting an outcome from a set of data, while regression is showing the relationship between dependent and independent variables.\\nWhile ML algorithms have been proven to be valuable tools in medical diagnosis [15, 16], it is essential to recognize that they should not replace human expertise and judgment. ML algorithms rely on the data they have been trained on and may not consider all relevant factors in the diagnostic process. Additionally, these algorithms are not infallible and can make errors. Therefore, it is crucial for healthcare professionals to exercise caution, review, and verify the results generated by ML systems to ensure accurate and reliable diagnoses. The integration of ML into healthcare can be considered as a collaborative approach that combines the strengths of both algorithms and human expertise to achieve the best possible outcomes for patients.\\n1.1 Motivation\\nThe main purpose of this thorough review is to provide a helpful guide for upcoming researchers, especially those who want to explore the unused possibilities of using ML for detecting diseases at an early stage. By delving deep into the application of ML algorithms across a diverse spectrum of diseases, this review endeavors to provide critical insights into the most effective strategies for early detection, thereby propelling the realm of medical diagnostics into a new era of precision and proactive care. In this pursuit, the review will address pivotal questions that hold paramount importance for researchers venturing into the realm of ML-powered early disease diagnosis. It is poised to be a beacon, illuminating crucial pathways for researchers seeking to incorporate ML into their diagnostic arsenal. To achieve this, the review will embark on a threefold exploration.\\nFirstly, it will chart a comprehensive course through the labyrinth of ML-based methods, guiding researchers in the art of applying these algorithms to diagnose a diverse array of diseases. Through a meticulous analysis of existing literature and studies, this section will equip future researchers with the sagacity to harness ML algorithms effectively within an expansive range of medical contexts.\\nSecondly, the review will cast a focused spotlight on five specific diseases: cancer, COVID-19, kidney disease, heart disease, and diabetes. Each of these diseases has been chosen with utmost consideration, reflecting their profound impact on humanity. Cancer, an enigmatic adversary with countless faces, strikes fear into hearts and calls for innovative diagnostic solutions. The unprecedented global turmoil wrought by COVID-19 emphasized the urgent need for rapid and accurate diagnostic tools. The stealthy yet devastating kidney disease, the relentless assault of heart disease, and the silent metabolic imbalance of diabetes underline the critical necessity of early detection. By delving into these human dangers, the review seeks to underscore the rationale for their selection and the urgency of pioneering ML-based diagnostic interventions.\\nThirdly, the review will delve into the realm of ML algorithms that are being actively employed in the realm of smart medical appl...Omiting #125542 chars\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"max_tokens\": 8192,\n  \"cache_name\": \"OpenAIApiProxy.call\"\n}"}

Last year at Google Health’s …\\nContent: Our progress on generative AI in health\\nLast year at Google Health’s Check Up event, we introduced Med-PaLM 2, our large language model (LLM) fine-tuned for healthcare. Since introducing that research, the model has become available to a set of global customer and partner organizations that are building solutions for a range of uses — including streamlining nurse handoffs and supporting clinicians’ documentation. At the end of last year, we introduced MedLM, a family of foundation models for healthcare built on Med-PaLM 2, and made it more broadly available through Google Cloud’s Vertex AI platform.\\nSince then, our work on generative AI for healthcare has progressed — from the new ways we’re training our health AI models to our latest research on applying AI to the healthcare industry.\\nNew modalities in models for healthcare\\nMedicine is a multimodal discipline; it’s made up of different types of information stored across formats — like radiology images, lab results, genomics data, environmental context and more. To get a fuller understanding of a person’s health, we need to build technology that understands all of this information.\\nWe’re bringing new capabilities to our models with the hope of making generative AI more helpful to healthcare organizations and people’s health. We just introduced MedLM for Chest X-ray, which has the potential to help transform radiology workflows by helping with the classification of chest X-rays for a variety of use cases. We’re starting with Chest X-rays because they are critical in detecting lung and heart conditions. MedLM for Chest X-ray is now available to trusted testers in an experimental preview on Google Cloud.\\nResearch on fine-tuning our models for the medical domain\\nApproximately 30% of the world’s data volume is being generated by the healthcare industry - and is growing at 36% annually. This includes large quantities of text, images, audio, and video. And further, important information about patients' histories is often buried deep in a medical record, making it difficult to find relevant information quickly.\\nFor these reasons, we’re researching how a version of the Gemini model, fine-tuned for the medical domain, can unlock new capabilities for advanced reasoning, understanding a high volume of context, and processing multiple modalities. Our latest research resulted in state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark for the U.S. Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE)-style questions at 91.1%, and on a video dataset called MedVidQA.\\nAnd because our Gemini models are multimodal, we were able to apply this fine-tuned model to other clinical benchmarks — including answering questions about chest X-ray images and genomics information. We’re also seeing promising results from our fine-tuned models on complex tasks such as report generation for 2D images like X-rays, as well as 3D images like brain CT scans – representing a step-change in our medical AI capabilities. While this work is still in the research phase, there’s potential for generative AI in radiology to bring assistive capabilities to health organizations.\\nA Personal Health LLM for personalized coaching and recommendations\\nFitbit and Google Research are working together to build a Personal Health Large Language Model that can power personalized health and wellness features in the Fitbit mobile app, helping people get even more insights and recommendations from the data from their Fitbit and Pixel devices. This model is being fine-tuned to deliver personalized coaching capabilities, like actionable messages and guidance, that can be individualized based on personal health and fitness goals. For example, this model may be able to analyze variations in your sleep patterns and sleep quality, and then suggest recommendations on how you might change the intensity of your workout based on those insights.\\nThis model is being built on Gemini models and fine-tuned on a de-identified, diverse set of health signals from high-quality research case studies. The studies are being collected and validated in partnership with accredited coaches and wellness experts, enabling the model to exhibit profound reasoning capabilities on physiological and behavioral data. For example, we’re testing performance using sleep medicine certification exam-like practice tests, and are already seeing that our model currently performs well. We'll continue to iterate and learn as we build this new Personal Health Large Language Model, and will share more research soon.\\nBetter understanding the assistive capabilities of AI\\nGenerative AI is already working as an assistive tool for clinicians, helping them with administrative tasks like documentation that typically takes up hours of time. We’re not stopping there – we’re now building on our work with partners to explore what’s possible.\\nEarlier this year, we introduced AMIE (Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer), a research AI system built on a LLM and optimized for diagnostic reasoning and clinical conversations. We explored the performance of a LLM by simulating text-based consultations with patient actors, adapting a well-known framework of “Objective Structured Clinical Examinations” to a consumer-facing user interface. In a randomized comparison with real primary care clinicians performing the same simulated text consultations, appropriately trained LLM rated higher than or on par with these consultations when measured for traits like diagnostic accuracy, empathy and helpful explanation.\\nOur next step is to test this with a healthcare organization to see how a LLM like AMIE can be helpful in supporting clinical conversations. We hope to learn how clinicians and patients perceive its use within the care experience with oversight from medical professionals.\\nHealthcare presents some of society’s most complex challenges. We’re working alongside our partners to see how AI might overcome them and improve care.\\n</content>\\n\\nMake your judgment and output according to the requirements, determining whether the webpage content can fulfill the purpose of this search round\\n\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"max_tokens\": 8192,\n  \"cache_name\": \"OpenAIApiProxy.call\"\n}"}

In addition, strong performance requires models to move beyond short passages of text to understand complex multimodal data, including images, videos, and the extensive length and breadth of electronic health records (EHRs). With this in mind, Gemini models have demonstrated a leap forward in multimodal and long-context reasoning, which presents substantial potential in medicine.\\nToday we present two recent research papers in which we explore the possibilities of Gemini in the healthcare space and introduce Med-Gemini, a new family of next-generation models fine-tuned for the medical domain. This family of models builds upon Google’s Gemini models by fine-tuning on de-identified medical data while inheriting Gemini’s native reasoning, multimodal, and long-context abilities. Med-Gemini builds on our initial research into medically tuned large language models with Med-PaLM.\\nThe first paper, “Capabilities of Gemini Models in Medicine”, describes a broad exploration of Gemini’s capabilities across a wide range of text, image, video, and EHR tasks. We benchmark the new Med-Gemini models on 14 tasks spanning text, multimodal and long-context applications, and demonstrate strong results, including a new state-of-the-art of 91.1% accuracy for the popular MedQA benchmark.\\nIn the second paper, “Advancing Multimodal Medical Capabilities of Gemini”, we offer a deeper dive into Med-Gemini’s multimodal capabilities through application to radiology, pathology, dermatology, ophthalmology, and genomics in healthcare. We focus on clinical applicability, improving benchmarks, and leveraging specialist evaluations to assess the models’ capabilities. For the first time, we demonstrate how large multimodal models can interpret complex 3D scans, answer clinical questions, and generate state-of-the-art radiology reports. Additionally, we demonstrate a novel mechanism to encode genomic information for risk prediction using large language models across a wealth of disease areas with strong results.\\nThe broad capabilities of Gemini models in medicine\\nIn “Capabilities of Gemini Models in Medicine”, we enhance our models’ clinical reasoning capabilities through self-training and web search integration, while improving multimodal performance through fine-tuning and customized encoders.\\nWe then benchmark Med-Gemini models on 14 tasks spanning text, multimodal and long-context applications. In the popular MedQA US Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE)-style question benchmark, Med-Gemini achieves a state-of-the-art performance of 91.1% accuracy, surpassing our prior best of Med-PaLM 2 by 4.6% (shown below). We conducted a careful inspection of the MedQA benchmark with expert clinicians, and found that 7.4% of the questions were deemed unfit for evaluation as they either lacked key information or supported multiple plausible interpretations. We account for these data quality issues to more precisely characterize the performance of our model.\\nOur approach utilizes uncertainty-guided web search to enable the model to use accurate and up-to-date information. This approach generalizes to achieve state-of-the-art performance in other challenging benchmarks, including complex diagnostic challenges from NEJM clinico-pathological conferences.\\nOn multimodal benchmarks such as NEJM Image Challenges and multimodal USMLE-style questions, Med-Gemini achieves a new state of the art, surpassing GPT-4 V by a wide margin. We demonstrate the effectiveness of long-context capabilities through medical video and EHR question answering on which Med-Gemini surpasses prior bespoke methods in a zero-shot manner. In order to assess performance on common text-based tasks, we evaluated performance on medical text summarization and simplification of referral letter generation, finding that Med-Gemini–produced drafts were preferred to those of clinicians for succinctness, coherence, and in some cases also for accuracy. In multiple qualitative examples, we demonstrate the clear potential for Med-Gemini to provide accurate and useful conversation about multimodal artifacts such as medical imaging (dermatology or radiology) or long multimodal research articles.\\nIn this safety-critical domain, considerable further research is needed before real-world application can be considered. For example, additional research and evaluations on potential biases, safety, and reliability are essential to ensure building safe applications. These systems should also be thoroughly evaluated not just in isolation, but with human experts in the loop.\\nAdvancing multimodal medical capabilities\\nOur second piece of research, “Advancing Multimodal Medical Capabilities of Gemini”, expands on our multimodal medical large language model work from 2023 by diving deeper into multimodal capabilities made possible by the Gemini family of models. We focus on tuning for radiology, pathology, dermatology, ophthalmology, and genomics applications in healthcare via Med-Gemini-2D, Med-Gemini-3D, and Med-Gemini-Polygenic.\\nTrained on a range of conventional 2D medical images (chest X-rays, CT slices, pathology slides, etc) using de-identified medical data with free text labels, Med-Gemini-2D is able to perform a number of tasks, such as classification, visual question answering, and text generation. One example includes report generation for chest X-rays, which was shown to exceed previous state-of-the-art results by up to 12% across normal and abnormal scans from two separate datasets.\\nMed-Gemini-3D can also understand and write radiology reports for 3D studies like computed tomography (CT) imaging of the head (example shown below). Volumetric, 3D scans are an essential tool in modern medicine, providing more context for countless diagnostic and treatment decisions requiring an understanding of 3D anatomy. Technically, 3D reflects a meaningful jump in multimodal clinical task complexity when compared to 2D. Additionally, in evaluation of the reports generated by Med-Gemini-3D, more than half were determined to result in the same care recommendations made by a radiologist. However, additional real-world research and validation is needed to ensure consistent expert reporting quality.\\nBeyond report generation, Med-Gemini-2D also achieves a new state-of-the-art for chest X-ray visual question answering, and performs well across a range of classification tasks across histopathology, ophthalmology, dermatology, and radiology, approaching the performance of task-specific models.\\nBeyond imaging, our new Med-Gemini-Polygenic research model is the first language model to perform disease and health outcome prediction from genomic data. The model outperforms previous linear polygenic scores for prediction of eight health outcomes (depression, stroke, glaucoma...Omiting #3004 chars\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"max_tokens\": 8192,\n  \"cache_name\": \"OpenAIApiProxy.call\"\n}"}

Typically, this entails exciting conversations around Google’s mobile platform, Android, or the newest hardware the company is planning to release. However, this year, something else stole the show: Google’s incredible progress in artificial intelligence (AI).\\nAI has been all the buzz in both Silicon Valley and around the world for the last few months, especially after the release of Chat-GPT and advanced generative AI systems. This has triggered somewhat of a frantic rat-race amongst tech giants: everyone wants a piece of the AI pie, and the race to the top is intense.\\nFor example, Microsoft is investing significant resources into its AI capabilities, relentlessly trying to integrate the technology across a variety of sectors, ranging from manufacturing to healthcare. Amazon is also innovating in this space, offering customers turn-key services to build their own machine learning and AI models.\\nIn a similar fashion, Google has made incredible strides in its own AI journey. Though many may suspect that the buzz around AI is relatively new, the company has actually been setting the foundation for advanced language models and usable AI for many years. This work has culminated in products with incredible potential, including PaLM 2, Google’s latest generation large language model.\\nAs an introduction to PaLM 2, Zoubin Ghahramani, Vice President of Google DeepMind, wrote last week: “today we’re introducing PaLM 2, our next generation language model. PaLM 2 is a state-of-the-art language model with improved multilingual, reasoning and coding capabilities.” He goes on to describe these capabilities further, discussing how PaLM 2 is trained across 100 languages, has a higher capability for common sense reasoning and advanced mathematics and logic, and can even generate advanced code.\\nNotably, Ghahramani also discusses one of the most highly anticipated arenas of impact for AI: healthcare. He delves into Med-PaLM 2, the large language model developed specifically to generate medical insights: “trained by our health research teams with medical knowledge, [Med-PaLM 2] can answer questions and summarize insights from a variety of dense medical texts. It achieves state-of-the-art results in medical competency, and was the first large language model to perform at “expert” level on U.S. Medical Licensing Exam-style [USMLE] questions. We're now adding multimodal capabilities to synthesize information like x-rays and mammograms to one day improve patient outcomes. Med-PaLM 2 will open up to a small group of Cloud customers for feedback later this summer to identify safe, helpful use cases.”\\nThe full 2023 keynote can be viewed here:\\nGoogle Cloud, especially for Healthcare, has been incredibly successful over the last few years. For example, Google Cloud’s Healthcare Data Engine is an industry-leading platform to optimize interoperability in healthcare, which could resolve some of the sector’s most challenging problems: significant data-fragmentation, lack of cohesive insights, and splintered patient journeys.\\nGoogle Cloud’s Global Director of Healthcare Strategy & Solutions, Aashima Gupta, and Global Director of Health Plan Strategy & Solutions, Amy Waldron, explain: “Industry-tailored LLMs like Med-PaLM 2 are part of a burgeoning family of generative AI technologies that have the potential to significantly enhance healthcare experiences. We’re looking forward to working with our customers to understand how Med-PaLM 2 might be used to facilitate rich, informative discussions, answer complex medical questions, and find insights in complicated and unstructured medical texts. They might also explore its utility to help draft short- and long-form responses and summarize documentation and insights from internal data sets and bodies of scientific knowledge.”\\nThe Cloud team was also responsible for launching the Medical Imaging Suite, a comprehensive AI platform to make medical imaging data “accessible, interoperable, and useful.”\\nUndoubtedly, the development of PaLM 2 will be a gamechanger for healthcare. Whether it be used to conduct advanced analytics of vast amounts of public health or patient data, or simply as a means to better triage and improve physician workflows, the technology has immense potential to create tangible impact.\\nEspecially with regards to synthesis and insight generation, this technology may be immensely useful for organizations that want to scale their tactical approach to improving patient outcomes. For example, for public entities, harnessing this technology may one day make possible the ingestion of terabytes of public health data that is otherwise unstructured to generate usable insights. For private organizations, this technology could prove to be a significant boon in the realms of interoperability, improving patient journeys, and succeeding in true longitudinal care.\\nNevertheless, this technology requires guardrails. While there is significant potential for beneficial use, there is also some “fear of the unknown.” That is, in the wrong hands, the powerful technology that drives these advancements in AI can have negative repercussions. This is a prime reason why the developer conference had an entire segment dedicated to the “responsible development” of AI, serving as a reminder of the checks and balances needed in this rapidly growing arena of technology. Nonetheless, if developers and innovators are able to create and harness this technology in a safe and sustainable manner, it may potentially change the face of healthcare delivery for generations to come.\\n</content>\\n\\nMake your judgment and output according to the requirements, determining whether the webpage content can fulfill the purpose of this search round\\n\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"max_tokens\": 8192,\n  \"cache_name\": \"OpenAIApiProxy.call\"\n}"}

But how do leading institutions like the Mayo Clinic turn AI’s potential into real-world impact? With a strategic approach and a commitment to responsible innovation, Mayo Clinic is setting a new benchmark for how AI can enhance patient care and streamline medical workflows.\\nKey speakers\\n- Moderator: Gabriel Perna, Modern Healthcare’s Digital Health Editor\\n- Speaker: Cris Ross, Mayo Clinic’s Former CIO\\nThese insights came from our ScaleUp:AI event in November 2024, an industry-leading global conference that features topics across technologies and industries. Watch the full session below:\\nKey takeaways\\n- Workforce shortages: AI can help alleviate the strain by automating tasks and improving efficiency.\\n- Data complexity: Healthcare generates about 30% of the world’s data, growing at an annual rate of 36%. AI helps structure this data for quality management, reimbursement, and research.\\n- Patient experience: AI tools are being deployed to improve patient interactions, such as summarizing doctor visits for stressed patients who might struggle to retain information.\\n- Access, affordability, and quality: AI can optimize medical workflows, reducing avoidable medical injuries and improving treatment quality.\\n- Cures for complex diseases: AI is already making strides in accelerating diagnostics and treatment strategies for conditions such as atrial fibrillation and cancer.\\nAddressing healthcare challenges with AI\\nWorkforce shortages and data complexity\\nThe healthcare industry is facing a generational shortage of professionals, which poses significant challenges for patient care. Ross emphasized that AI can help bridge this gap by taking on administrative and repetitive tasks, allowing medical professionals to focus on patient interactions and complex decision-making.\\n“We have a generational shortage of healthcare professionals.”\\n“We have a generational shortage of healthcare professionals,” Ross explained. “AI has some challenges in other industries from an ethical perspective on reduction in jobs, but look, if it can do the jobs of people in healthcare, it’s a hero job.”\\nAt the same time, healthcare is one of the most data-intensive industries, with an estimated 30% of the world’s healthcare-related data. This data grows at a staggering 36% annual rate, presenting both challenges and opportunities for AI.\\n“Doctors want to have conversations with patients,” Ross said. “So what can we do to improve the patient experience by using AI tools to be explainers, so patients can ask questions of a record and have a computer answer in a sensible way, where doctors don’t have time to answer those questions.”\\nEnhancing patient experience and healthcare accessibility\\nThe stress and confusion that often accompany medical visits make it difficult for patients to absorb and retain crucial health information. AI tools can improve patient experiences by summarizing doctor visits and providing personalized explanations.\\nAdditionally, quality healthcare remains out of reach for many due to accessibility and affordability issues. AI is being used to improve workflow efficiencies, streamline diagnoses, and enhance decision-making to reduce costs and increase care quality.\\n“We still have tens of thousands of people who are injured every year in the U.S. from medical injury that’s avoidable. So there’s all sorts of things we can do to improve.” Ross noted. AI can help reduce these errors, ensure more efficient triage, and make scheduling and operational management more effective.\\nAdvancing treatments and accelerating disease detection\\nAI is accelerating disease detection and treatment breakthroughs, particularly in areas like arrhythmia detection, cancer treatment, and transplant matching.\\n“Some of the stuff that we’ve done in Mayo is, for instance, detection of arrhythmias,” Ross explained. “We’re at the point where the rhythms can be detected on a single lead ECG, meaning something that can be in an Apple watch or some other device. From that, we can both diagnose arrhythmias and treat them. So when a patient goes into arrhythmia, you can take interventions to get them back into rhythm.”\\nHe also highlighted Mayo Clinic’s work with Google on radiotherapy optimization: “We worked with Google to develop algorithms to do better radiotherapy treatment of disease, and we started with head and neck cancers.” With AI-powered radiotherapy, AI can maximize tumor targeting while minimizing damage to surrounding tissue, potentially transforming cancer treatment outcomes.\\nAI at scale: Mayo Clinic’s enterprise-wide approach\\nUnlike many healthcare institutions that focus on isolated AI projects, Mayo Clinic has developed an enterprise-wide AI strategy:\\nData consolidation: Over a decade, Mayo Clinic unified its electronic health records into a single system, creating a comprehensive, structured patient database.\\nAI factory: Hosted on Google Cloud’s Vertex AI, Mayo Clinic’s AI factory supports over 250 AI research and deployment projects, integrating models with real-time patient data.\\nCloud app factory: Ensuring AI models can be deployed efficiently within workflows, bridging the gap between innovation and clinical application.\\n“We have two jobs: One is to support technology for the world’s best hospital. The second is to innovate at Silicon Valley speed and put solutions into production.”\\n“We have two jobs,” Ross explained. “One is to support technology for the world’s best hospital. The second is to innovate at Silicon Valley speed and put solutions into production.”\\n“We need to go as fast as we can, but no faster than is safe”\\nAs AI adoption grows, Ross urged the industry to focus on the five core challenges he outlined. Looking ahead, he sees a future where startups, research institutions, and cloud platforms collaborate to create transformative healthcare solutions.\\n“We need to go as fast as we can, but no faster than is safe,” he concluded, reinforcing the importance of responsible AI deployment in healthcare.\\nWith AI-driven solutions already improving diagnosis, treatment, and patient care, Mayo Clinic’s work serves as a blueprint for the future of AI in medicine.\\nWatch more sessions from ScaleUp:AI, and see scaleup.events for updates on ScaleUp:AI 2025.\\n</content>\\n\\nMake your judgment and output according to the requirements, determining whether the webpage content can fulfill the purpose of this search round\\n\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"max_tokens\": 8192,\n  \"cache_name\": \"OpenAIApiProxy.call\"\n}"}

It can generate text, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content and more.\\nIn May, we watched the results of months and years of our foundational and applied work announced on stage at Google I/O. Principally, this included PaLM 2, a large language model (LLM) that brought together compute-optimal scaling, an improved dataset mixture, and model architecture to excel at advanced reasoning tasks.\\nBy fine-tuning and instruction-tuning PaLM 2 for different purposes, we were able to integrate it into numerous Google products and features, including:\\n- An update to Bard, which enabled multilingual capabilities. Since its initial launch, Bard is now available in more than 40 languages and over 230 countries and territories, and with extensions, Bard can find and show relevant information from Google tools used every day — like Gmail, Google Maps, YouTube, and more.\\n- Search Generative Experience (SGE), which uses LLMs to reimagine both how to organize information and how to help people navigate through it, creating a more fluid, conversational interaction model for our core Search product. This work extended the search engine experience from primarily focused on information retrieval into something much more — capable of retrieval, synthesis, creative generation and continuation of previous searches — while continuing to serve as a connection point between users and the web content they seek.\\n- MusicLM, a text-to-music model powered by AudioLM and MuLAN, which can make music from text, humming, images or video and musical accompaniments to singing.\\n- Duet AI, our AI-powered collaborator that provides users with assistance when they use Google Workspace and Google Cloud. Duet AI in Google Workspace, for example, helps users write, create images, analyze spreadsheets, draft and summarize emails and chat messages, and summarize meetings. Duet AI in Google Cloud helps users code, deploy, scale, and monitor applications, as well as identify and accelerate resolution of cybersecurity threats.\\n- And many other developments.\\nIn June, following last year’s release of our text-to-image generation model Imagen, we released Imagen Editor, which provides the ability to use region masks and natural language prompts to interactively edit generative images to provide much more precise control over the model output.\\nLater in the year, we released Imagen 2, which improved outputs via a specialized image aesthetics model based on human preferences for qualities such as good lighting, framing, exposure, and sharpness.\\nIn October, we launched a feature that helps people practice speaking and improve their language skills. The key technology that enabled this functionality was a novel deep learning model developed in collaboration with the Google Translate team, called Deep Aligner. This single new model has led to dramatic improvements in alignment quality across all tested language pairs, reducing average alignment error rate from 25% to 5% compared to alignment approaches based on Hidden Markov models (HMMs).\\nIn November, in partnership with YouTube, we announced Lyria, our most advanced AI music generation model to date. We released two experiments designed to open a new playground for creativity, DreamTrack and music AI tools, in concert with YouTube’s Principles for partnering with the music industry on AI technology.\\nThen in December, we launched Gemini, our most capable and general AI model. Gemini was built to be multimodal from the ground up across text, audio, image and videos.\\nOur initial family of Gemini models comes in three different sizes, Nano, Pro, and Ultra. Nano models are our smallest and most efficient models for powering on-device experiences in products like Pixel. The Pro model is highly-capable and best for scaling across a wide range of tasks. The Ultra model is our largest and most capable model for highly complex tasks.\\nIn a technical report about Gemini models, we showed that Gemini Ultra’s performance exceeds current state-of-the-art results on 30 of the 32 widely-used academic benchmarks used in LLM research and development. With a score of 90.04%, Gemini Ultra was the first model to outperform human experts on MMLU, and achieved a state-of-the-art score of 59.4% on the new MMMU benchmark.\\nBuilding on AlphaCode, the first AI system to perform at the level of the median competitor in competitive programming, we introduced AlphaCode 2 powered by a specialized version of Gemini. When evaluated on the same platform as the original AlphaCode, we found that AlphaCode 2 solved 1.7x more problems, and performed better than 85% of competition participants\\nAt the same time, Bard got its biggest upgrade with its use of the Gemini Pro model, making it far more capable at things like understanding, summarizing, reasoning, coding, and planning. In six out of eight benchmarks, Gemini Pro outperformed GPT-3.5, including in MMLU, one of the key standards for measuring large AI models, and GSM8K, which measures grade school math reasoning. Gemini Ultra will come to Bard early next year through Bard Advanced, a new cutting-edge AI experience.\\nGemini Pro is also available on Vertex AI, Google Cloud’s end-to-end AI platform that empowers developers to build applications that can process information across text, code, images, and video. Gemini Pro was also made available in AI Studio in December.\\nTo best illustrate some of Gemini’s c...Omiting #23802 chars\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"max_tokens\": 8192,\n  \"cache_name\": \"OpenAIApiProxy.call\"\n}"}

A new collaboration with the Mayo Clinic brings physician team — and married couple — Chieh-Ju Chao and Chia-Chun Chiang to the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI (HAI) to learn how to bridge the gap.\\nImproving Treatment for Migraine Patients\\nAt the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, Chia-Chun Chiang splits her medical practice between treating patients who’ve suffered acute stroke and migraine sufferers who come to her to seek help with the intense headaches that can sometimes incapacitate them for weeks, months, or longer. Chiang, a specialist in headache medicine and vascular neurology, not only hopes to improve these daily realities for her patients but also wants to explore how AI may someday lead to better overall treatment through exciting new breakthroughs.\\nFor the next year, Chiang will be a visiting scholar at Stanford HAI, where she’s exploring the intersection of AI and neurology. The appointment is part of a new collaborative program between HAI and the Mayo Clinic and will give Chiang a chance to do what she’s always loved — find innovative solutions to challenging medical questions.\\nBorn in Taiwan, Chiang found her medical horizons were expanded early in her career, both by her neurosurgeon father and a series of influential mentors on two continents.\\n“My father always encouraged me to think not just about day-to-day realities in medical practice but about making research breakthroughs in medicine — about discovery,” she says. “Arthur Chiou, a professor of biophotonics at National Yang Ming University, opened a window for me to see different types of medical research. Later, I came to the University of California, San Diego, and met Professor Shu Chien in the department of bioengineering. He got me into the world of using math and physics to solve medical research problems. It was inspiring.”\\nChiang’s time at Stanford HAI will be spent on several research projects focusing on her special interest in migraine and stroke. She hopes to use AI to help doctors determine which of many preventive migraine medications might help chronic migraine sufferers — those experiencing migraine attacks more than 15 days per month — stave off debilitating attacks.\\n“Right now there’s no way to predict if a patient will respond to medication A, B, C, D, or E,” she says. “It’s a trial-and-error process, where we start with one medication and wait three months to see if it helps. This can be a long time and a long process when you’re in pain. I’m hoping to be able to apply advanced machine learning technologies to the Mayo Clinic’s established headache database to help predict good matches or to develop personalized treatment plans for patients with migraine.”\\nChiang is also collaborating with Nigam Shah, a Stanford professor of medicine and chief data scientist for Stanford Health Care, to be able to more effectively utilize all of a patient’s electronic health record data to understand which migraine patients might be at risk of stroke and cardiovascular disease.\\n“Things like clinician notes, consultations, and admission notes are written in free text, which traditionally have been hard for data scientists to access,” she says. “Dr. Shah’s lab has developed several advanced machine learning tools tailored to health care notes that can extract and use this sort of information. We hope to be able to apply these tools to databases at the Mayo Clinic and at Stanford to give us some solid research results from two different health care systems.”\\nChiang says AI is changing the field of neurology through innovations such as telemedicine and AI-assisted CT analysis, both of which benefit stroke patients, particularly those in isolated regions of the country where small hospitals may not have neurologists on staff. Continuing the introduction of relevant and user-friendly technology into health care, however, will require improved communication between those who develop AI and those who treat patients.\\n“I’m very excited about the use of AI in my field, which is why I wanted to come to HAI and contribute to this process by stimulating more discussion and work between data scientists and clinicians,” she says. “I see patients who are suffering every day in clinic. It’s crucial for us to continue imagining how AI tools can be developed to improve their quality of life.”\\nDeveloping Better Tools for Echocardiography\\nMayo Clinic cardiologist Chieh-Ju Chao was a teenager in Taiwan when the college entrance exam set him on a trajectory to medical school. Deep down, though, the 18-year-old harbored a secret ambition.\\n“I was happy to go into medicine, but I always loved physics,” he says. “It was always in the back of my mind. I love the beauty of the laws and formulas in physics and, as a kid, I dreamed of being the next Einstein or Feynman.” After medical school, Chao took postgraduate physics courses in Taiwan before becoming a postdoctoral fellow at UC San Diego, where he led a research project to build a 3D dynamic heart model. He began to see intersections between physics and medicine, particularly in the field of cardiology. “It was one of the most important periods of my life and one that really changed my career path,” he says.\\nFor the next year, Chao will have a chance to deeply explore his interdisciplinary interests, as a visiting scholar at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence. As part of a collaborative program between Stanford HAI and the Mayo Clinic, facilitated and guided by HAI Co-Director Fei-Fei Li, Chao will expand his current research on the potential use of AI technology to augment echocardiography, which harnesses ultrasound waves to examine the anatomy and dynamics of the heart. Chao hopes his dual background in medicine and technology will allow him to bridge the knowledge gap that often exists between health care and technology professionals and to accelerate the expansion of AI systems into clinical medicine at the Mayo Clinic and elsewhere.\\n“The usual pathway for this has always been for clinicians to come up with an idea, then talk to AI engineers,” he says. “But that process can take a long time because communication between the two disciplines is not easy. For the first time, this program between Mayo and HAI sends clinicians out into the AI field to learn some of these skills and take them back. I knew this was something I wanted to do. I see myself as a person who will be able to speak both languages.”\\nAt the Mayo Clinic, Chao studies how AI models might be used to solve clinical questions, such as how to classify different grades of cardiac diastolic dysfunction, which occur when the heart’s damaged ventricles are unable to completely fill with blood. (That work, in fact, resulted in Chao being named a “Young Investigator Award” finalist at the 2022 Amer...Omiting #2476 chars\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"max_tokens\": 8192,\n  \"cache_name\": \"OpenAIApiProxy.call\"\n}"}

They're developing AI models to make health information more accessible, personalize care, and …\\nContent: Advancing healthcare and scientific discovery with AI\\nLast week, at the Lake Nona Impact Forum for advancing global health, I discussed the potential of AI to meaningfully improve healthcare and advance science. Our recent AI breakthroughs provide unprecedented opportunities to make healthcare more accessible, personalized and effective for everyone, and to significantly accelerate scientific discovery. Here’s an update on our progress, how we’re collaborating with partners to bring AI to global healthcare settings and our recently announced AI co-scientist.\\nAI is making accurate health information more accessible\\nGoogle is often the first place people turn to when they are looking for answers to health-related questions, so we strive to make sure everyone has access to relevant, high-quality health information in their moment of need. Using Lens, people can take a picture to search skin conditions that are visually similar to what they see on their own skin, and on YouTube, we piloted AI tools with health creators and organizations like Cleveland Clinic to make it easier for them to publish authoritative, high-quality content.\\nFor care providers, we launched MedLM and Search for Healthcare which can provide answers to medical questions. These are available on the Google Cloud Vertex AI platform, helping clinicians make more informed decisions and helping patients receive the precise care they need. Our research into medical factuality ensures that health-related content generated by language models is as reliable and grounded in factual sources as possible.\\nGenerative AI is paving the way for personalized healthcare\\nWith advancements in multimodality and conversational AI, we’re able to reimagine patient care and how it could be personalized for everyone, with an emphasis on preventive healthcare.\\nFrom X-rays to digital health records, medicine is multimodal. Building on our MedLM research, we developed Med-Gemini, next-generation models for healthcare which have Gemini’s superior multimodal and reasoning capabilities and are fine-tuned on de-identified medical data. In published research, Med-Gemini achieved 91.1% accuracy on U.S. medical exam-style questions, and we demonstrated how the models can effectively interpret 3D scans or answer complex clinical questions.\\nWe’re researching how AI systems could serve as conversational diagnostic partners in clinical settings, using Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer (AMIE), a research AI system optimized for diagnostic reasoning and conversations. It is designed to take a “clinical history” and ask intelligent questions to help derive a differential diagnosis and handle discussions with empathy, including in subspecialist domains.\\nMobile and wearable devices are another promising area where generative AI models could provide personalized insights for both healthcare and wellness, using data such as step count and heart rate. We designed the Personal Health Large Language Model, another fine-tuned version of Gemini, which can interpret sensor data and generate insights and recommendations about an individual’s sleep and fitness patterns.\\nAI is improving health outcomes globally\\nEarly diagnosis of disease is critical for improving health outcomes. Over the past decade, we’ve tapped into AI’s imaging and diagnostic capabilities and developed AI models to help detect diseases including breast cancer, lung cancer and diabetic retinopathy. Through partnerships, we’re now bringing these solutions at scale to clinical settings so that more patients can benefit from timely and accurate screenings. The impact is particularly profound in low-resource medical settings and countries with fewer specialist doctors per capita. Over the next decade, our health-tech partners in India and Thailand aim to deliver 6 million diabetic retinopathy screenings at no cost to patients, and Apollo Radiology International will build on our AI models to provide 3 million free screenings across India for tuberculosis, lung cancer and breast cancer. Adding to our various initiatives to address maternal health in Africa, we’re also developing an ML model for cardiotocography, used to predict fetal well-being, and exploring its utility in medical settings with limited resources.\\nWe’re also laying the technological foundations for broader access to healthcare. Our Health AI Developer Foundations include open-weight models and resources to help developers build AI models for healthcare more efficiently. And solutions powered by our Open Health Stack (OHS) — a suite of open-source tools that makes it easier for developers to create next-gen digital health solutions for healthcare workers — have already been deployed across regions in Africa, South Asia and Southeast Asia to support frontline healthcare workers serving millions of patients.\\nAI is accelerating scientific discovery\\nMedicine is rooted in science. Building on AI’s ability to synthesize information and perform complex reasoning tasks, we’re exploring how it could augment scientific and biomedical discovery through our work on AI co-scientist, a multi-agent AI system based on Gemini 2.0. AI co-scientist is designed to function as a collaborative tool for scientists. It’s intended to uncover new, original knowledge and help scientists formulate novel research hypotheses and proposals, building upon prior evidence and tailored to specific research objectives. It has already demonstrated potential in areas such as drug repurposing for acute myeloid leukemia, proposing hypotheses for novel treatment targets for liver fibrosis and explaining mechanisms of horizontal gene transfer underlying antimicrobial resistance — each of which is a complex application and presents a different set of challenges.\\nWe continue to realize the incredible potential of AI to advance science and improve, personalize and democratize access to healthcare. The “magic cycle” where we achieve research breakthroughs and translate them to real world impact is accelerating and expanding in scope. We’ll pursue this opportunity responsibly, in collaboration with global partners, and continue to share our research — in 2024, we published more than 50 papers in which we shared cutting-edge health research, and we recently shared our 2025 Health Impact Report. Ultimately, we believe AI will continue to help advance healthcare and science for the benefit of billions of people.\\n</content>\\n\\nMake your judgment and output according to the requirements, determining whether the webpage content can fulfill the purpose of this search round\\n\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"max_tokens\": 8192,\n  \"cache_name\": \"OpenAIApiProxy.call\"\n}"}

Build technologies that work together: Effective healthcare technologies must work …\\nContent: Company\\nWe are very excited to announce the launch of DeepMind Health\\nWe founded DeepMind to solve intelligence and use it to make the world a better place by developing technologies that help address some of society's toughest challenges. It was clear to us that we should focus on healthcare because it’s an area where we believe we can make a real difference to people’s lives across the world.\\nWe're starting in the UK, where the National Health Service is hugely important to our team. The NHS helped bring many of us into the world, and has looked after our loved ones when they've most needed help. We want to see the NHS thrive, and to ensure that its talented clinicians get the tools and support they need to continue providing world-class care.\\nFrontline nurses, doctors and other healthcare professionals who spend their days treating patients know better than anyone what's needed to provide outstanding care. We at DeepMind Health aim to support clinicians by providing the technical expertise needed to build and scale technologies that help them provide the best possible care to their patients.\\nThe Future\\nWhile projects like Hark and AKI detection are in their early stages, the problems they solve are fundamental to the NHS. The hope is that these tools can help shift more resources away from reaction and towards better prevention. Ultimately the aim is to give nurses and doctors more time to focus on what’s most important.\\nThese past few months have given us a glimpse of what’s possible. As we continue to explore what nurses and doctors need, and work with them to design and scale new and better tools, we will remain guided by the following principles:\\n- Valuing clinician and patient expertise: Nurses, doctors and patients are the experts — we can help by building tools that support them. Everything we do will be driven by the needs and insights of those involved in frontline care. From identifying challenges, to co-designing solutions, to oversight and governance, clinicians and patients will lead us every step of the way.\\n- Stand behind the National Health Service: We are proud supporters of the NHS and believe in the core principle that healthcare should be universally available and free at the point of use. DeepMind Health’s work will support and strengthen the delivery of exemplary care in the NHS.\\n- Build technologies that work together: Effective healthcare technologies must work well with existing systems while supporting further innovation by clinicians and technologists. We will develop open and interoperable technology while absolutely protecting the confidentiality of patient data. This ensures that the benefits of innovation are widely shared.\\nThe world’s toughest problems become more tractable when diverse teams of leading practitioners work together in partnership. Building world-class technologies that support clinicians is one of the most important things we can do, and DeepMind Health is our promise to do just that.\\n</content>\\n\\nMake your judgment and output according to the requirements, determining whether the webpage content can fulfill the purpose of this search round\\n\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"max_tokens\": 8192,\n  \"cache_name\": \"OpenAIApiProxy.call\"\n}"}

Researchers note that conventional learning algorithms often do not incorporate existing scientific knowledge or hypotheses. Instead, these rely heavily on large, unbiased datasets, which can be challenging to obtain.\\nAccording to Dr. Li, this limitation considerably restricts the flexibility of AI methods and their uses in areas that demand knowledge discovery, like medicine.\\nAI is a valuable tool for identifying patterns in large and complex datasets like those employed in cancer research. The central challenge in using conventional AI has been maximizing the embedded information within those datasets.\\n\\\"Lack of integration between existing knowledge and hypothesis can be a problem. AI models may produce results without careful design from researchers and clinicians what we refer to as the 'rubbish in rubbish out’ problem,\\\" says Dr. Li. \\\"Without being guided by scientific questions, AI may provide less efficient analyses and struggle to yield significant insights that can help form testable hypotheses and move medicine forward.\\\"\\nWith hypothesis-driven AI, researchers look to find ways to incorporate an understanding of a disease, for example, integrating known pathogenic genetic variants and interactions between certain genes in cancer into the design of the learning algorithm. This will enable researchers and clinicians to determine which components contribute to model performance and, hence, enhance interpretability. Further, this strategy can address dataset issues and promote our focus on open scientific questions.\\n\\\"This new class of AI opens a new avenue for better understanding the interactions between cancer and the immune system and holds great promise not only to test medical hypotheses but also predict and explain how patients will respond to immunotherapies,\\\" says Daniel Billadeau, Ph.D., a professor in Mayo Clinic's Department of Immunology.

CNBC spoke with companies that have been testing Google's technology, like HCA Healthcare, and experts say the potential for impact is real, though they are taking steps to implement it carefully.\\nThe MedLM suite includes a large and a medium-sized AI model, both built on Med-PaLM 2, a large language model trained on medical data that Google first announced in March. It is generally available to eligible Google Cloud customers in the U.S. starting Wednesday, and Google said while the cost of the AI suite varies depending on how companies use the different models, the medium-sized model is less expensive to run.\\nGoogle said it also plans to introduce health-care-specific versions of Gemini, the company's newest and \\\"most capable\\\" AI model, to MedLM in the future.\\nAashima Gupta, Google Cloud's global director of health-care strategy and solutions, said the company found that different medically tuned AI models can carry out certain tasks better than others. That's why Google decided to introduce a suite of models instead of trying to build a \\\"one-size-fits-all\\\" solution.\\nFor instance, Google said its larger MedLM model is better for carrying out complicated tasks that require deep knowledge and lots of compute power, such as conducting a study using data from a health-care organization's entire patient population. But if companies need a more agile model that can be optimized for specific or real-time functions, such as summarizing an interaction between a doctor and patient, the medium-sized model should work better, according to Gupta.\\nReal-world use cases\\nWhen Google announced Med-PaLM 2 in March, the company initially said it could be used to answer questions like \\\"What are the first warning signs of pneumonia?\\\" and \\\"Can incontinence be cured?\\\" But as the company has tested the technology with customers, the use cases have changed, according to Greg Corrado, head of Google's health AI.\\nCorrado said clinicians don't often need help with \\\"accessible\\\" questions about the nature of a disease, so Google hasn't seen much demand for those capabilities from customers. Instead, health organizations often want AI to help solve more back-office or logistical problems, like managing paperwork.\\n\\\"They want something that's helping them with the real pain points and slowdowns that are in their workflow, that only they know,\\\" Corrado told CNBC.\\nFor instance, HCA Healthcare, one of the largest health systems in the U.S., has been testing Google's AI technology since the spring. The company announced an official collaboration with Google Cloud in August that aims to use its generative AI to \\\"improve workflows on time-consuming tasks.\\\"\\nDr. Michael Schlosser, senior vice president of care transformation and innovation at HCA, said the company has been using MedLM to help emergency medicine physicians automatically document their interactions with patients. For instance, HCA uses an ambient speech documentation system from a company called Augmedix to transcribe doctor-patient meetings. Google's MedLM suite can then take those transcripts and break them up into the components of an ER provider note.\\nSchlosser said HCA has been using MedLM within emergency rooms at four hospitals, and the company wants to expand use over the next year. By January, Schlosser added, he expects Google's technology will be able to successfully generate more than half of a note without help from providers. For doctors who can spend up to four hours a day on clerical paperwork, Schlosser said saving that time and effort makes a meaningful difference.\\n\\\"That's been a huge leap forward for us,\\\" Schlosser told CNBC. \\\"We now think we're going to be at a point where the AI, by itself, can create 60-plus percent of the note correctly on its own before we have the human doing the review and the editing.\\\"\\nSchlosser said HCA is also working to use MedLM to develop a handoff tool for nurses. The tool can read through the electronic health record and identify relevant information for nurses to pass along to the next shift.\\nHandoffs are \\\"laborious\\\" and a real pain point for nurses, so it would be \\\"powerful\\\" to automate the process, Schlosser said. Nurses across HCA's hospitals carry out around 400,000 handoffs a week, and two HCA hospitals have been testing the nurse handoff tool. Schlosser said nurses conduct a side-by-side comparison of a traditional handoff and an AI-generated handoff and provide feedback.\\nWith both use cases, though, HCA has found that MedLM is not foolproof.\\nSchlosser said the fact that AI models can spit out incorrect information is a big challenge, and HCA has been working with Google to come up with best practices to minimize those fabrications. He added that token limits, which restrict the amount of data that can be fed to the model, and managing the AI over time have been additional challenges for HCA.\\n\\\"What I would say right now, is that the hype around the current use of these AI models in health care is outstripping the reality,\\\" Schlosser said. \\\"Everyone's contending with this problem, and no one has really let these models loose in a scaled way in the health-care systems because of that.\\\"\\nEven so, Schlosser said providers' initial response to MedLM has been positive, and they recognize that they are not working with the finished product yet. He said HCA is working hard to implement the technology in a responsible way to avoid putting patients at risk.\\n\\\"We're being very cautious with how we approach these AI models,\\\" he said. \\\"We're not using those use cases where the model outputs can somehow affect someone's diagnosis and treatment.\\\"\\nGoogle also plans to introduce health-care-specific versions of Gemini to MedLM in the future. Its shares popped 5% after Gemini's launch earlier this month, but Google faced scrutiny over its demonstration video, which was not conducted in real time, the company confirmed to Bloomberg.\\nIn a statement, Google told CNBC: \\\"The video is an illustrative depiction of the possibilities of interacting with Gemini, based on real multimodal prompts and outputs from testing. We look forward to seeing what people create when access to Gemini Pro opens on December 13.\\\"\\nCorrado and Gupta of Google said Gemini is still in early stages, and it needs to be tested and evaluated with customers in controlled health-care settings before the model rolls out through MedLM more broadly.\\n\\\"We've been testing Med-PaLM 2 with our customers for months, and now we're comfortable taking that as part of MedLM,\\\" Gupta said. \\\"Gemini will follow the same thing.\\\"\\nSchlosser said HCA is \\\"very excited\\\" about Gemini, and the company is already working out plans to test the technology, \\\"We think that may give us an additional level of performance when we get that,\\\" he said.\\n...Omiting #2212 chars\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"max_tokens\": 8192,\n  \"cache_name\": \"OpenAIApiProxy.call\"\n}"}

Typically, this entails exciting conversations around Google’s mobile platform, Android, or the newest hardware the company is planning to release. However, this year, something else stole the show: Google’s incredible progress in artificial intelligence (AI).\\nAI has been all the buzz in both Silicon Valley and around the world for the last few months, especially after the release of Chat-GPT and advanced generative AI systems. This has triggered somewhat of a frantic rat-race amongst tech giants: everyone wants a piece of the AI pie, and the race to the top is intense.\\nFor example, Microsoft is investing significant resources into its AI capabilities, relentlessly trying to integrate the technology across a variety of sectors, ranging from manufacturing to healthcare. Amazon is also innovating in this space, offering customers turn-key services to build their own machine learning and AI models.\\nIn a similar fashion, Google has made incredible strides in its own AI journey. Though many may suspect that the buzz around AI is relatively new, the company has actually been setting the foundation for advanced language models and usable AI for many years. This work has culminated in products with incredible potential, including PaLM 2, Google’s latest generation large language model.\\nAs an introduction to PaLM 2, Zoubin Ghahramani, Vice President of Google DeepMind, wrote last week: “today we’re introducing PaLM 2, our next generation language model. PaLM 2 is a state-of-the-art language model with improved multilingual, reasoning and coding capabilities.” He goes on to describe these capabilities further, discussing how PaLM 2 is trained across 100 languages, has a higher capability for common sense reasoning and advanced mathematics and logic, and can even generate advanced code.\\nNotably, Ghahramani also discusses one of the most highly anticipated arenas of impact for AI: healthcare. He delves into Med-PaLM 2, the large language model developed specifically to generate medical insights: “trained by our health research teams with medical knowledge, [Med-PaLM 2] can answer questions and summarize insights from a variety of dense medical texts. It achieves state-of-the-art results in medical competency, and was the first large language model to perform at “expert” level on U.S. Medical Licensing Exam-style [USMLE] questions. We're now adding multimodal capabilities to synthesize information like x-rays and mammograms to one day improve patient outcomes. Med-PaLM 2 will open up to a small group of Cloud customers for feedback later this summer to identify safe, helpful use cases.”\\nThe full 2023 keynote can be viewed here:\\nGoogle Cloud, especially for Healthcare, has been incredibly successful over the last few years. For example, Google Cloud’s Healthcare Data Engine is an industry-leading platform to optimize interoperability in healthcare, which could resolve some of the sector’s most challenging problems: significant data-fragmentation, lack of cohesive insights, and splintered patient journeys.\\nGoogle Cloud’s Global Director of Healthcare Strategy & Solutions, Aashima Gupta, and Global Director of Health Plan Strategy & Solutions, Amy Waldron, explain: “Industry-tailored LLMs like Med-PaLM 2 are part of a burgeoning family of generative AI technologies that have the potential to significantly enhance healthcare experiences. We’re looking forward to working with our customers to understand how Med-PaLM 2 might be used to facilitate rich, informative discussions, answer complex medical questions, and find insights in complicated and unstructured medical texts. They might also explore its utility to help draft short- and long-form responses and summarize documentation and insights from internal data sets and bodies of scientific knowledge.”\\nThe Cloud team was also responsible for launching the Medical Imaging Suite, a comprehensive AI platform to make medical imaging data “accessible, interoperable, and useful.”\\nUndoubtedly, the development of PaLM 2 will be a gamechanger for healthcare. Whether it be used to conduct advanced analytics of vast amounts of public health or patient data, or simply as a means to better triage and improve physician workflows, the technology has immense potential to create tangible impact.\\nEspecially with regards to synthesis and insight generation, this technology may be immensely useful for organizations that want to scale their tactical approach to improving patient outcomes. For example, for public entities, harnessing this technology may one day make possible the ingestion of terabytes of public health data that is otherwise unstructured to generate usable insights. For private organizations, this technology could prove to be a significant boon in the realms of interoperability, improving patient journeys, and succeeding in true longitudinal care.\\nNevertheless, this technology requires guardrails. While there is significant potential for beneficial use, there is also some “fear of the unknown.” That is, in the wrong hands, the powerful technology that drives these advancements in AI can have negative repercussions. This is a prime reason why the developer conference had an entire segment dedicated to the “responsible development” of AI, serving as a reminder of the checks and balances needed in this rapidly growing arena of technology. Nonetheless, if developers and innovators are able to create and harness this technology in a safe and sustainable manner, it may potentially change the face of healthcare delivery for generations to come.\\n</content>\\n\\nOrganize and extract as required, focusing solely on the webpage content itself.

Last year at Google Health’s …\\nContent: Our progress on generative AI in health\\nLast year at Google Health’s Check Up event, we introduced Med-PaLM 2, our large language model (LLM) fine-tuned for healthcare. Since introducing that research, the model has become available to a set of global customer and partner organizations that are building solutions for a range of uses — including streamlining nurse handoffs and supporting clinicians’ documentation. At the end of last year, we introduced MedLM, a family of foundation models for healthcare built on Med-PaLM 2, and made it more broadly available through Google Cloud’s Vertex AI platform.\\nSince then, our work on generative AI for healthcare has progressed — from the new ways we’re training our health AI models to our latest research on applying AI to the healthcare industry.\\nNew modalities in models for healthcare\\nMedicine is a multimodal discipline; it’s made up of different types of information stored across formats — like radiology images, lab results, genomics data, environmental context and more. To get a fuller understanding of a person’s health, we need to build technology that understands all of this information.\\nWe’re bringing new capabilities to our models with the hope of making generative AI more helpful to healthcare organizations and people’s health. We just introduced MedLM for Chest X-ray, which has the potential to help transform radiology workflows by helping with the classification of chest X-rays for a variety of use cases. We’re starting with Chest X-rays because they are critical in detecting lung and heart conditions. MedLM for Chest X-ray is now available to trusted testers in an experimental preview on Google Cloud.\\nResearch on fine-tuning our models for the medical domain\\nApproximately 30% of the world’s data volume is being generated by the healthcare industry - and is growing at 36% annually. This includes large quantities of text, images, audio, and video. And further, important information about patients' histories is often buried deep in a medical record, making it difficult to find relevant information quickly.\\nFor these reasons, we’re researching how a version of the Gemini model, fine-tuned for the medical domain, can unlock new capabilities for advanced reasoning, understanding a high volume of context, and processing multiple modalities. Our latest research resulted in state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark for the U.S. Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE)-style questions at 91.1%, and on a video dataset called MedVidQA.\\nAnd because our Gemini models are multimodal, we were able to apply this fine-tuned model to other clinical benchmarks — including answering questions about chest X-ray images and genomics information. We’re also seeing promising results from our fine-tuned models on complex tasks such as report generation for 2D images like X-rays, as well as 3D images like brain CT scans – representing a step-change in our medical AI capabilities. While this work is still in the research phase, there’s potential for generative AI in radiology to bring assistive capabilities to health organizations.\\nA Personal Health LLM for personalized coaching and recommendations\\nFitbit and Google Research are working together to build a Personal Health Large Language Model that can power personalized health and wellness features in the Fitbit mobile app, helping people get even more insights and recommendations from the data from their Fitbit and Pixel devices. This model is being fine-tuned to deliver personalized coaching capabilities, like actionable messages and guidance, that can be individualized based on personal health and fitness goals. For example, this model may be able to analyze variations in your sleep patterns and sleep quality, and then suggest recommendations on how you might change the intensity of your workout based on those insights.\\nThis model is being built on Gemini models and fine-tuned on a de-identified, diverse set of health signals from high-quality research case studies. The studies are being collected and validated in partnership with accredited coaches and wellness experts, enabling the model to exhibit profound reasoning capabilities on physiological and behavioral data. For example, we’re testing performance using sleep medicine certification exam-like practice tests, and are already seeing that our model currently performs well. We'll continue to iterate and learn as we build this new Personal Health Large Language Model, and will share more research soon.\\nBetter understanding the assistive capabilities of AI\\nGenerative AI is already working as an assistive tool for clinicians, helping them with administrative tasks like documentation that typically takes up hours of time. We’re not stopping there – we’re now building on our work with partners to explore what’s possible.\\nEarlier this year, we introduced AMIE (Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer), a research AI system built on a LLM and optimized for diagnostic reasoning and clinical conversations. We explored the performance of a LLM by simulating text-based consultations with patient actors, adapting a well-known framework of “Objective Structured Clinical Examinations” to a consumer-facing user interface. In a randomized comparison with real primary care clinicians performing the same simulated text consultations, appropriately trained LLM rated higher than or on par with these consultations when measured for traits like diagnostic accuracy, empathy and helpful explanation.\\nOur next step is to test this with a healthcare organization to see how a LLM like AMIE can be helpful in supporting clinical conversations. We hope to learn how clinicians and patients perceive its use within the care experience with oversight from medical professionals.\\nHealthcare presents some of society’s most complex challenges. We’re working alongside our partners to see how AI might overcome them and improve care.\\n</content>\\n\\nOrganize and extract as required, focusing solely on the webpage content itself.

A new collaboration with the Mayo Clinic brings physician team — and married couple — Chieh-Ju Chao and Chia-Chun Chiang to the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI (HAI) to learn how to bridge the gap.\\nImproving Treatment for Migraine Patients\\nAt the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, Chia-Chun Chiang splits her medical practice between treating patients who’ve suffered acute stroke and migraine sufferers who come to her to seek help with the intense headaches that can sometimes incapacitate them for weeks, months, or longer. Chiang, a specialist in headache medicine and vascular neurology, not only hopes to improve these daily realities for her patients but also wants to explore how AI may someday lead to better overall treatment through exciting new breakthroughs.\\nFor the next year, Chiang will be a visiting scholar at Stanford HAI, where she’s exploring the intersection of AI and neurology. The appointment is part of a new collaborative program between HAI and the Mayo Clinic and will give Chiang a chance to do what she’s always loved — find innovative solutions to challenging medical questions.\\nBorn in Taiwan, Chiang found her medical horizons were expanded early in her career, both by her neurosurgeon father and a series of influential mentors on two continents.\\n“My father always encouraged me to think not just about day-to-day realities in medical practice but about making research breakthroughs in medicine — about discovery,” she says. “Arthur Chiou, a professor of biophotonics at National Yang Ming University, opened a window for me to see different types of medical research. Later, I came to the University of California, San Diego, and met Professor Shu Chien in the department of bioengineering. He got me into the world of using math and physics to solve medical research problems. It was inspiring.”\\nChiang’s time at Stanford HAI will be spent on several research projects focusing on her special interest in migraine and stroke. She hopes to use AI to help doctors determine which of many preventive migraine medications might help chronic migraine sufferers — those experiencing migraine attacks more than 15 days per month — stave off debilitating attacks.\\n“Right now there’s no way to predict if a patient will respond to medication A, B, C, D, or E,” she says. “It’s a trial-and-error process, where we start with one medication and wait three months to see if it helps. This can be a long time and a long process when you’re in pain. I’m hoping to be able to apply advanced machine learning technologies to the Mayo Clinic’s established headache database to help predict good matches or to develop personalized treatment plans for patients with migraine.”\\nChiang is also collaborating with Nigam Shah, a Stanford professor of medicine and chief data scientist for Stanford Health Care, to be able to more effectively utilize all of a patient’s electronic health record data to understand which migraine patients might be at risk of stroke and cardiovascular disease.\\n“Things like clinician notes, consultations, and admission notes are written in free text, which traditionally have been hard for data scientists to access,” she says. “Dr. Shah’s lab has developed several advanced machine learning tools tailored to health care notes that can extract and use this sort of information. We hope to be able to apply these tools to databases at the Mayo Clinic and at Stanford to give us some solid research results from two different health care systems.”\\nChiang says AI is changing the field of neurology through innovations such as telemedicine and AI-assisted CT analysis, both of which benefit stroke patients, particularly those in isolated regions of the country where small hospitals may not have neurologists on staff. Continuing the introduction of relevant and user-friendly technology into health care, however, will require improved communication between those who develop AI and those who treat patients.\\n“I’m very excited about the use of AI in my field, which is why I wanted to come to HAI and contribute to this process by stimulating more discussion and work between data scientists and clinicians,” she says. “I see patients who are suffering every day in clinic. It’s crucial for us to continue imagining how AI tools can be developed to improve their quality of life.”\\nDeveloping Better Tools for Echocardiography\\nMayo Clinic cardiologist Chieh-Ju Chao was a teenager in Taiwan when the college entrance exam set him on a trajectory to medical school. Deep down, though, the 18-year-old harbored a secret ambition.\\n“I was happy to go into medicine, but I always loved physics,” he says. “It was always in the back of my mind. I love the beauty of the laws and formulas in physics and, as a kid, I dreamed of being the next Einstein or Feynman.” After medical school, Chao took postgraduate physics courses in Taiwan before becoming a postdoctoral fellow at UC San Diego, where he led a research project to build a 3D dynamic heart model. He began to see intersections between physics and medicine, particularly in the field of cardiology. “It was one of the most important periods of my life and one that really changed my career path,” he says.\\nFor the next year, Chao will have a chance to deeply explore his interdisciplinary interests, as a visiting scholar at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence. As part of a collaborative program between Stanford HAI and the Mayo Clinic, facilitated and guided by HAI Co-Director Fei-Fei Li, Chao will expand his current research on the potential use of AI technology to augment echocardiography, which harnesses ultrasound waves to examine the anatomy and dynamics of the heart. Chao hopes his dual background in medicine and technology will allow him to bridge the knowledge gap that often exists between health care and technology professionals and to accelerate the expansion of AI systems into clinical medicine at the Mayo Clinic and elsewhere.\\n“The usual pathway for this has always been for clinicians to come up with an idea, then talk to AI engineers,” he says. “But that process can take a long time because communication between the two disciplines is not easy. For the first time, this program between Mayo and HAI sends clinicians out into the AI field to learn some of these skills and take them back. I knew this was something I wanted to do. I see myself as a person who will be able to speak both languages.”\\nAt the Mayo Clinic, Chao studies how AI models might be used to solve clinical questions, such as how to classify different grades of cardiac diastolic dysfunction, which occur when the heart’s damaged ventricles are unable to completely fill with blood. (That work, in fact, resulted in Chao being named a “Young Investigator Award” finalist at the 2022 American College of Cardiology Conference.)\\nAt Stanford HAI, he’ll focus on two primary research projects. The first will incorporate the use of AI to give cardiologists a more realistic view of the heart during procedures such as aortic and mitral valve replacements, which are often done with the use of catheters rather than open-heart surgery. Positioning these catheters currently relies on the 2D images provided by echocardiogram and X-ray. Chao envisions AI models that might be able to compile that information with CT images of the patient’s heart, giving doctors a real-time 3D and even hologram-based picture that wou...Omiting #1935 chars\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"max_tokens\": 8192,\n  \"cache_name\": \"OpenAIApiProxy.call\"\n}"}

CNBC spoke with companies that have been testing Google's technology, like HCA Healthcare, and experts say the potential for impact is real, though they are taking steps to implement it carefully.\\nThe MedLM suite includes a large and a medium-sized AI model, both built on Med-PaLM 2, a large language model trained on medical data that Google first announced in March. It is generally available to eligible Google Cloud customers in the U.S. starting Wednesday, and Google said while the cost of the AI suite varies depending on how companies use the different models, the medium-sized model is less expensive to run.\\nGoogle said it also plans to introduce health-care-specific versions of Gemini, the company's newest and \\\"most capable\\\" AI model, to MedLM in the future.\\nAashima Gupta, Google Cloud's global director of health-care strategy and solutions, said the company found that different medically tuned AI models can carry out certain tasks better than others. That's why Google decided to introduce a suite of models instead of trying to build a \\\"one-size-fits-all\\\" solution.\\nFor instance, Google said its larger MedLM model is better for carrying out complicated tasks that require deep knowledge and lots of compute power, such as conducting a study using data from a health-care organization's entire patient population. But if companies need a more agile model that can be optimized for specific or real-time functions, such as summarizing an interaction between a doctor and patient, the medium-sized model should work better, according to Gupta.\\nReal-world use cases\\nWhen Google announced Med-PaLM 2 in March, the company initially said it could be used to answer questions like \\\"What are the first warning signs of pneumonia?\\\" and \\\"Can incontinence be cured?\\\" But as the company has tested the technology with customers, the use cases have changed, according to Greg Corrado, head of Google's health AI.\\nCorrado said clinicians don't often need help with \\\"accessible\\\" questions about the nature of a disease, so Google hasn't seen much demand for those capabilities from customers. Instead, health organizations often want AI to help solve more back-office or logistical problems, like managing paperwork.\\n\\\"They want something that's helping them with the real pain points and slowdowns that are in their workflow, that only they know,\\\" Corrado told CNBC.\\nFor instance, HCA Healthcare, one of the largest health systems in the U.S., has been testing Google's AI technology since the spring. The company announced an official collaboration with Google Cloud in August that aims to use its generative AI to \\\"improve workflows on time-consuming tasks.\\\"\\nDr. Michael Schlosser, senior vice president of care transformation and innovation at HCA, said the company has been using MedLM to help emergency medicine physicians automatically document their interactions with patients. For instance, HCA uses an ambient speech documentation system from a company called Augmedix to transcribe doctor-patient meetings. Google's MedLM suite can then take those transcripts and break them up into the components of an ER provider note.\\nSchlosser said HCA has been using MedLM within emergency rooms at four hospitals, and the company wants to expand use over the next year. By January, Schlosser added, he expects Google's technology will be able to successfully generate more than half of a note without help from providers. For doctors who can spend up to four hours a day on clerical paperwork, Schlosser said saving that time and effort makes a meaningful difference.\\n\\\"That's been a huge leap forward for us,\\\" Schlosser told CNBC. \\\"We now think we're going to be at a point where the AI, by itself, can create 60-plus percent of the note correctly on its own before we have the human doing the review and the editing.\\\"\\nSchlosser said HCA is also working to use MedLM to develop a handoff tool for nurses. The tool can read through the electronic health record and identify relevant information for nurses to pass along to the next shift.\\nHandoffs are \\\"laborious\\\" and a real pain point for nurses, so it would be \\\"powerful\\\" to automate the process, Schlosser said. Nurses across HCA's hospitals carry out around 400,000 handoffs a week, and two HCA hospitals have been testing the nurse handoff tool. Schlosser said nurses conduct a side-by-side comparison of a traditional handoff and an AI-generated handoff and provide feedback.\\nWith both use cases, though, HCA has found that MedLM is not foolproof.\\nSchlosser said the fact that AI models can spit out incorrect information is a big challenge, and HCA has been working with Google to come up with best practices to minimize those fabrications. He added that token limits, which restrict the amount of data that can be fed to the model, and managing the AI over time have been additional challenges for HCA.\\n\\\"What I would say right now, is that the hype around the current use of these AI models in health care is outstripping the reality,\\\" Schlosser said. \\\"Everyone's contending with this problem, and no one has really let these models loose in a scaled way in the health-care systems because of that.\\\"\\nEven so, Schlosser said providers' initial response to MedLM has been positive, and they recognize that they are not working with the finished product yet. He said HCA is working hard to implement the technology in a responsible way to avoid putting patients at risk.\\n\\\"We're being very cautious with how we approach these AI models,\\\" he said. \\\"We're not using those use cases where the model outputs can somehow affect someone's diagnosis and treatment.\\\"\\nGoogle also plans to introduce health-care-specific versions of Gemini to MedLM in the future. Its shares popped 5% after Gemini's launch earlier this month, but Google faced scrutiny over its demonstration video, which was not conducted in real time, the company confirmed to Bloomberg.\\nIn a statement, Google told CNBC: \\\"The video is an illustrative depiction of the possibilities of interacting with Gemini, based on real multimodal prompts and outputs from testing. We look forward to seeing what people create when access to Gemini Pro opens on December 13.\\\"\\nCorrado and Gupta of Google said Gemini is still in early stages, and it needs to be tested and evaluated with customers in controlled health-care settings before the model rolls out through MedLM more broadly.\\n\\\"We've been testing Med-PaLM 2 with our customers for months, and now we're comfortable taking that as part of MedLM,\\\" Gupta said. \\\"Gemini will follow the same thing.\\\"\\nSchlosser said HCA is \\\"very excited\\\" about Gemini, and the company is already working out plans to test the technology, \\\"We think that may give us an additional level of performance when we get that,\\\" he said.\\nAnother company that has been using MedLM is BenchSci, which aims to use AI to solve problems in drug discovery. Google is an investor in BenchSci, and the company has been testing its MedLM technology for a few months.\\nLiran Belenzon, BenchSci's co-founder and CEO, said the company has merged MedLM's AI with BenchSci's own technology to help scientists identify biomarkers, which are key to understanding how a disease progresses and how it can be cured.\\nBelenzon said the company spent a lot of time testing and validating the model, including providing Google with feedback about necessary improvements.

But how do leading institutions like the Mayo Clinic turn AI’s potential into real-world impact? With a strategic approach and a commitment to responsible innovation, Mayo Clinic is setting a new benchmark for how AI can enhance patient care and streamline medical workflows.\\nKey speakers\\n- Moderator: Gabriel Perna, Modern Healthcare’s Digital Health Editor\\n- Speaker: Cris Ross, Mayo Clinic’s Former CIO\\nThese insights came from our ScaleUp:AI event in November 2024, an industry-leading global conference that features topics across technologies and industries. Watch the full session below:\\nKey takeaways\\n- Workforce shortages: AI can help alleviate the strain by automating tasks and improving efficiency.\\n- Data complexity: Healthcare generates about 30% of the world’s data, growing at an annual rate of 36%. AI helps structure this data for quality management, reimbursement, and research.\\n- Patient experience: AI tools are being deployed to improve patient interactions, such as summarizing doctor visits for stressed patients who might struggle to retain information.\\n- Access, affordability, and quality: AI can optimize medical workflows, reducing avoidable medical injuries and improving treatment quality.\\n- Cures for complex diseases: AI is already making strides in accelerating diagnostics and treatment strategies for conditions such as atrial fibrillation and cancer.\\nAddressing healthcare challenges with AI\\nWorkforce shortages and data complexity\\nThe healthcare industry is facing a generational shortage of professionals, which poses significant challenges for patient care. Ross emphasized that AI can help bridge this gap by taking on administrative and repetitive tasks, allowing medical professionals to focus on patient interactions and complex decision-making.\\n“We have a generational shortage of healthcare professionals.”\\n“We have a generational shortage of healthcare professionals,” Ross explained. “AI has some challenges in other industries from an ethical perspective on reduction in jobs, but look, if it can do the jobs of people in healthcare, it’s a hero job.”\\nAt the same time, healthcare is one of the most data-intensive industries, with an estimated 30% of the world’s healthcare-related data. This data grows at a staggering 36% annual rate, presenting both challenges and opportunities for AI.\\n“Doctors want to have conversations with patients,” Ross said. “So what can we do to improve the patient experience by using AI tools to be explainers, so patients can ask questions of a record and have a computer answer in a sensible way, where doctors don’t have time to answer those questions.”\\nEnhancing patient experience and healthcare accessibility\\nThe stress and confusion that often accompany medical visits make it difficult for patients to absorb and retain crucial health information. AI tools can improve patient experiences by summarizing doctor visits and providing personalized explanations.\\nAdditionally, quality healthcare remains out of reach for many due to accessibility and affordability issues. AI is being used to improve workflow efficiencies, streamline diagnoses, and enhance decision-making to reduce costs and increase care quality.\\n“We still have tens of thousands of people who are injured every year in the U.S. from medical injury that’s avoidable. So there’s all sorts of things we can do to improve.” Ross noted. AI can help reduce these errors, ensure more efficient triage, and make scheduling and operational management more effective.\\nAdvancing treatments and accelerating disease detection\\nAI is accelerating disease detection and treatment breakthroughs, particularly in areas like arrhythmia detection, cancer treatment, and transplant matching.\\n“Some of the stuff that we’ve done in Mayo is, for instance, detection of arrhythmias,” Ross explained. “We’re at the point where the rhythms can be detected on a single lead ECG, meaning something that can be in an Apple watch or some other device. From that, we can both diagnose arrhythmias and treat them. So when a patient goes into arrhythmia, you can take interventions to get them back into rhythm.”\\nHe also highlighted Mayo Clinic’s work with Google on radiotherapy optimization: “We worked with Google to develop algorithms to do better radiotherapy treatment of disease, and we started with head and neck cancers.” With AI-powered radiotherapy, AI can maximize tumor targeting while minimizing damage to surrounding tissue, potentially transforming cancer treatment outcomes.\\nAI at scale: Mayo Clinic’s enterprise-wide approach\\nUnlike many healthcare institutions that focus on isolated AI projects, Mayo Clinic has developed an enterprise-wide AI strategy:\\nData consolidation: Over a decade, Mayo Clinic unified its electronic health records into a single system, creating a comprehensive, structured patient database.\\nAI factory: Hosted on Google Cloud’s Vertex AI, Mayo Clinic’s AI factory supports over 250 AI research and deployment projects, integrating models with real-time patient data.\\nCloud app factory: Ensuring AI models can be deployed efficiently within workflows, bridging the gap between innovation and clinical application.\\n“We have two jobs: One is to support technology for the world’s best hospital. The second is to innovate at Silicon Valley speed and put solutions into production.”\\n“We have two jobs,” Ross explained. “One is to support technology for the world’s best hospital. The second is to innovate at Silicon Valley speed and put solutions into production.”\\n“We need to go as fast as we can, but no faster than is safe”\\nAs AI adoption grows, Ross urged the industry to focus on the five core challenges he outlined. Looking ahead, he sees a future where startups, research institutions, and cloud platforms collaborate to create transformative healthcare solutions.\\n“We need to go as fast as we can, but no faster than is safe,” he concluded, reinforcing the importance of responsible AI deployment in healthcare.\\nWith AI-driven solutions already improving diagnosis, treatment, and patient care, Mayo Clinic’s work serves as a blueprint for the future of AI in medicine.\\nWatch more sessions from ScaleUp:AI, and see scaleup.events for updates on ScaleUp:AI 2025.\\n</content>\\n\\nOrganize and extract as required, focusing solely on the webpage content itself.

In addition, strong performance requires models to move beyond short passages of text to understand complex multimodal data, including images, videos, and the extensive length and breadth of electronic health records (EHRs). With this in mind, Gemini models have demonstrated a leap forward in multimodal and long-context reasoning, which presents substantial potential in medicine.\\nToday we present two recent research papers in which we explore the possibilities of Gemini in the healthcare space and introduce Med-Gemini, a new family of next-generation models fine-tuned for the medical domain. This family of models builds upon Google’s Gemini models by fine-tuning on de-identified medical data while inheriting Gemini’s native reasoning, multimodal, and long-context abilities. Med-Gemini builds on our initial research into medically tuned large language models with Med-PaLM.\\nThe first paper, “Capabilities of Gemini Models in Medicine”, describes a broad exploration of Gemini’s capabilities across a wide range of text, image, video, and EHR tasks. We benchmark the new Med-Gemini models on 14 tasks spanning text, multimodal and long-context applications, and demonstrate strong results, including a new state-of-the-art of 91.1% accuracy for the popular MedQA benchmark.\\nIn the second paper, “Advancing Multimodal Medical Capabilities of Gemini”, we offer a deeper dive into Med-Gemini’s multimodal capabilities through application to radiology, pathology, dermatology, ophthalmology, and genomics in healthcare. We focus on clinical applicability, improving benchmarks, and leveraging specialist evaluations to assess the models’ capabilities. For the first time, we demonstrate how large multimodal models can interpret complex 3D scans, answer clinical questions, and generate state-of-the-art radiology reports. Additionally, we demonstrate a novel mechanism to encode genomic information for risk prediction using large language models across a wealth of disease areas with strong results.\\nThe broad capabilities of Gemini models in medicine\\nIn “Capabilities of Gemini Models in Medicine”, we enhance our models’ clinical reasoning capabilities through self-training and web search integration, while improving multimodal performance through fine-tuning and customized encoders.\\nWe then benchmark Med-Gemini models on 14 tasks spanning text, multimodal and long-context applications. In the popular MedQA US Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE)-style question benchmark, Med-Gemini achieves a state-of-the-art performance of 91.1% accuracy, surpassing our prior best of Med-PaLM 2 by 4.6% (shown below). We conducted a careful inspection of the MedQA benchmark with expert clinicians, and found that 7.4% of the questions were deemed unfit for evaluation as they either lacked key information or supported multiple plausible interpretations. We account for these data quality issues to more precisely characterize the performance of our model.\\nOur approach utilizes uncertainty-guided web search to enable the model to use accurate and up-to-date information. This approach generalizes to achieve state-of-the-art performance in other challenging benchmarks, including complex diagnostic challenges from NEJM clinico-pathological conferences.\\nOn multimodal benchmarks such as NEJM Image Challenges and multimodal USMLE-style questions, Med-Gemini achieves a new state of the art, surpassing GPT-4 V by a wide margin. We demonstrate the effectiveness of long-context capabilities through medical video and EHR question answering on which Med-Gemini surpasses prior bespoke methods in a zero-shot manner. In order to assess performance on common text-based tasks, we evaluated performance on medical text summarization and simplification of referral letter generation, finding that Med-Gemini–produced drafts were preferred to those of clinicians for succinctness, coherence, and in some cases also for accuracy. In multiple qualitative examples, we demonstrate the clear potential for Med-Gemini to provide accurate and useful conversation about multimodal artifacts such as medical imaging (dermatology or radiology) or long multimodal research articles.\\nIn this safety-critical domain, considerable further research is needed before real-world application can be considered. For example, additional research and evaluations on potential biases, safety, and reliability are essential to ensure building safe applications. These systems should also be thoroughly evaluated not just in isolation, but with human experts in the loop.\\nAdvancing multimodal medical capabilities\\nOur second piece of research, “Advancing Multimodal Medical Capabilities of Gemini”, expands on our multimodal medical large language model work from 2023 by diving deeper into multimodal capabilities made possible by the Gemini family of models. We focus on tuning for radiology, pathology, dermatology, ophthalmology, and genomics applications in healthcare via Med-Gemini-2D, Med-Gemini-3D, and Med-Gemini-Polygenic.\\nTrained on a range of conventional 2D medical images (chest X-rays, CT slices, pathology slides, etc) using de-identified medical data with free text labels, Med-Gemini-2D is able to perform a number of tasks, such as classification, visual question answering, and text generation. One example includes report generation for chest X-rays, which was shown to exceed previous state-of-the-art results by up to 12% across normal and abnormal scans from two separate datasets.\\nMed-Gemini-3D can also understand and write radiology reports for 3D studies like computed tomography (CT) imaging of the head (example shown below). Volumetric, 3D scans are an essential tool in modern medicine, providing more context for countless diagnostic and treatment decisions requiring an understanding of 3D anatomy. Technically, 3D reflects a meaningful jump in multimodal clinical task complexity when compared to 2D. Additionally, in evaluation of the reports generated by Med-Gemini-3D, more than half were determined to result in the same care recommendations made by a radiologist. However, additional real-world research and validation is needed to ensure consistent expert reporting quality.\\nBeyond report generation, Med-Gemini-2D also achieves a new state-of-the-art for chest X-ray visual question answering, and performs well across a range of classification tasks across histopathology, ophthalmology, dermatology, and radiology, approaching the performance of task-specific models.\\nBeyond imaging, our new Med-Gemini-Polygenic research model is the first language model to perform disease and health outcome prediction from genomic data. The model outperforms previous linear polygenic scores for prediction of eight health outcomes (depression, stroke, glaucoma, rheumatoid arthritis, all cause mortality, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), type 2 diabetes) and is surprisingly able to predict an additional six health outcomes for which it had not explicitly been trained. Based on this performance, we believe the model is able to leverage intrinsic knowledge about genetic correlation for predicting health outcomes.\\nEvaluation is an increasingly critical piece of research in this domain.

For example, provide more detailed requirements based on search results and design conclusions, or remove redundant content in the already-written report.\\n\\n2. **Atomic Writing Task Determination**: Within the context of the overall plan and the already-written report, evaluate whether the given writing task is an atomic task, meaning it does not require further planning. According to research and analysis theories, a writing task can be further broken down into more granular writing sub-tasks, search sub-tasks and analysis sub-tasks. Writing tasks involve the actual creation of specific portions of text, while analysis sub-tasks can include tasks such as designing outlines, detailed outlines, data analysis, information organization, logic structure building, and key argument determination, e.t.c, to support actual writing; search sub-tasks are responsible for gathering necessary information and data from internet.\\n\\n# Goal Updating Tips\\n- When the references in the task goal can be resolved using the results from the search or analysis tasks, update the task goal.\\n- When combining the results of search tasks or analysis tasks can make the task goal more specific, update the task goal.\\n- Carefully review the results of the dependent search or analysis tasks. If the current task goal is inappropriate or contains errors based on these results, update the task goal.\\n- Directly output the updated goal.

This surge in research activity has translated into practical applications across the healthcare spectrum, from diagnostic tools to treatment optimization systems.\n\n### Scope and Objectives\n\nThis report examines three fundamental areas where AI is making substantial impacts:\n\n1. Medical Diagnosis: Analysis of AI's role in improving diagnostic accuracy and efficiency across various medical conditions, including breakthrough achievements in imaging analysis and disease prediction.\n\n2. Treatment Planning: Evaluation of AI applications in personalizing treatment approaches, optimizing surgical procedures, and enhancing therapeutic outcomes.\n\n3. Patient Outcomes: Assessment of AI's contribution to improving clinical results, reducing healthcare costs, and enhancing the overall quality of care delivery.\n\nThe analysis draws upon real-world implementation cases, including pioneering initiatives at major healthcare institutions. For instance, Mayo Clinic's enterprise-wide AI strategy and HCA Healthcare's innovative documentation systems demonstrate the practical application and scalability of AI solutions in healthcare settings [reference:12][reference:15].\n\nThrough systematic examination of these areas, this report aims to provide healthcare stakeholders with a comprehensive understanding of AI's current capabilities, implementation challenges, and future potential in transforming medical care delivery. The following sections detail specific applications, outcomes, and considerations for successful AI integration in healthcare settings.\n</article>"}}], "add_time": "2025-03-14_16:06:26", "hint": "{\n  \"model\": \"claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022\",\n  \"messages\": [\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"\\nThe collaborative report-writing requirement to be completed:  \\n**Write a simple report on the impact of artificial intelligence on healthcare, focusing on diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient outcomes.**  \\n\\nIt has been decomposed into several parts (writing tasks), as shown below.

Highlighting recent AI model achievements like Med-Gemini\n3. Providing real-world implementation examples\n4. Maintaining a professional yet engaging tone\n5. Ensuring smooth transitions between subsections\n6. Including appropriate citations using [reference:X] format\n\nThe section should flow naturally from the Introduction's context about AI's growing role in healthcare, while diving deeper into specific diagnostic capabilities and implementations.\n</think>\n\n<article>\n\n## AI in Medical Diagnosis\n\nThe application of artificial intelligence in medical diagnosis represents one of the most promising developments in modern healthcare. AI systems have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in detecting and diagnosing various medical conditions, often matching or exceeding human expert performance. This section examines both the technical capabilities of AI diagnostic systems and their practical implementation in clinical settings.\n\n### Technical Capabilities and Performance Metrics\n\nAI diagnostic systems have achieved unprecedented accuracy levels across a wide spectrum of medical conditions. In breast cancer detection, advanced artificial neural networks (ANN) and deep belief networks have demonstrated exceptional accuracy rates ranging from 98.57% to 99.68%, significantly enhancing early detection capabilities [reference:2]. Similarly, in COVID-19 diagnosis, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) analyzing chest X-rays and CT scans have achieved accuracy rates up to 99.68%, providing crucial support during the pandemic response [reference:3].\n\nThe scope of AI's diagnostic capabilities extends to various chronic conditions:\n- Diabetes prediction models show accuracy rates ranging from 75.7% to 99%\n- Kidney disease detection systems using Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and ANNs achieve over 97% accuracy\n- Heart disease diagnostic tools, particularly those utilizing ensemble learning approaches, demonstrate accuracy rates exceeding 97% [reference:2][reference:3]\n\nRecent developments in AI models have pushed the boundaries of diagnostic capabilities even further. Med-Gemini, a state-of-the-art AI system, has achieved a remarkable 91.1% accuracy on the MedQA benchmark, demonstrating expert-level performance on medical licensing examination questions [reference:9]. Additionally, AI systems have shown a 12% improvement in chest X-ray report generation accuracy, enhancing the speed and precision of radiological diagnostics [reference:11].\n\n### Implementation in Clinical Practice\n\nThe transition from theoretical capabilities to practical applications has been marked by successful implementations across various healthcare settings. In medical imaging analysis, AI systems are being deployed for:\n- Real-time interpretation of 3D medical scans\n- Enhanced genomic health outcome predictions\n- Automated preliminary screening of routine imaging studies [reference:13]\n\nThese implementations have demonstrated particular success in emergency medicine and routine screening scenarios. Healthcare institutions implementing AI-powered diagnostic tools report significant improvements in workflow efficiency, with diagnosis times reduced from hours to minutes in emergency cases [reference:4]. This acceleration in diagnostic processes has proven especially valuable in time-critical situations where rapid decision-making is essential.\n\nThe integration of AI diagnostic systems with existing healthcare infrastructure has yielded impressive results in clinical settings. Major healthcare institutions have reported:\n- Improved early-stage disease detection, particularly in oncology, with breast cancer patients showing greater than 90% five-year survival rates when AI-assisted early diagnosis is employed [reference:2]\n- Enhanced accuracy in routine screening procedures\n- Reduced diagnostic errors through AI-powered second opinions\n- More efficient allocation of clinical resources [reference:7]\n\n### Comparative Performance with Human Expertise\n\nWhen comparing AI performance with human expertise, studies have shown that AI systems can match or exceed human diagnostic accuracy in specific domains. This is particularly evident in:\n- Radiological analysis, where AI systems have demonstrated expert-level performance in identifying subtle abnormalities\n- Pathology screening, where AI assists in reducing false positives and negatives\n- Complex pattern recognition in medical imaging [reference:11][reference:13]\n\nHowever, it's important to note that AI's role is primarily complementary to human expertise rather than replacive. The most effective implementations combine AI's processing capabilities with clinician oversight, creating a synergistic approach that enhances diagnostic accuracy while maintaining the critical role of human judgment in medical decision-making.\n\nThe integration of AI in medical diagnosis continues to evolve, with ongoing research and development focusing on expanding capabilities and improving accuracy across an ever-wider range of medical conditions. As these systems become more sophisticated and widely implemented, they promise to further enhance the speed, accuracy, and accessibility of medical diagnostics, ultimately contributing to improved patient outcomes.\n\n</article>"}}], "add_time": "2025-03-14_16:07:26", "hint": "{\n  \"model\": \"claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022\",\n  \"messages\": [\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"\\nThe collaborative report-writing requirement to be completed:  \\n**Write a simple report on the impact of artificial intelligence on healthcare, focusing on diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient outcomes.**  \\n\\nIt has been decomposed into several parts (writing tasks), as shown below.

In Parkinson's disease cases, for example, AI systems analyze continuous patient monitoring data to optimize deep brain stimulation settings, leading to more effective symptom management and improved quality of life [reference:2]. This dynamic adjustment capability represents a significant advancement over traditional static treatment approaches.\n\nPredictive analytics for population health management has emerged as another crucial application of AI in treatment planning. These systems:\n- Identify high-risk patient populations\n- Predict potential health complications before they occur\n- Enable proactive intervention strategies\n- Optimize resource allocation for preventive care [reference:4]\n\n### Clinical Implementation and Integration\n\nLeading healthcare institutions are spearheading the integration of AI into their clinical workflows, with Mayo Clinic's enterprise-wide AI strategy serving as a notable example. Their comprehensive approach includes:\n- Management of over 250 AI research projects\n- Implementation of a unified Electronic Health Record (EHR) database\n- Development of specialized AI applications for various medical specialties\n- Integration of AI tools into daily clinical practice [reference:12]\n\nHCA Healthcare's implementation represents another successful case study in AI integration. Their focus on AI-powered documentation aims to achieve 60% AI-generated clinical notes by early 2024, demonstrating the practical application of AI in reducing administrative burden while maintaining accuracy [reference:15]. This initiative includes:\n- Automated emergency medicine documentation\n- AI-assisted nurse shift handoff tools\n- Streamlined clinical workflow processes\n- Enhanced data capture and analysis capabilities\n\nThe integration of AI systems with existing clinical workflows has required careful consideration of both technical and human factors. Successful implementations have focused on:\n- Seamless integration with existing EHR systems\n- Minimal disruption to established clinical procedures\n- Clear communication of AI-generated insights to healthcare providers\n- Maintenance of human oversight in decision-making processes\n\nReal-world optimization examples demonstrate the practical benefits of AI integration. In arrhythmia detection, AI systems provide continuous monitoring and early warning capabilities, enabling faster intervention and improved outcomes. In radiotherapy planning, AI optimization has led to:\n- More precise treatment targeting\n- Reduced radiation exposure to healthy tissue\n- Improved treatment efficiency\n- Better patient outcomes [reference:12]\n\nThe success of these implementations highlights the importance of a systematic approach to AI integration in healthcare settings. Healthcare organizations are increasingly recognizing that effective AI implementation requires not just technological sophistication but also careful consideration of workflow integration, staff training, and ongoing evaluation of outcomes.\n\nThrough these various applications and implementations, AI is demonstrating its potential to transform treatment planning and delivery from a one-size-fits-all approach to a highly personalized and optimized process. As healthcare institutions continue to expand their AI capabilities, the integration of these technologies promises to further enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of medical treatment delivery.\n\n</article>"}}], "add_time": "2025-03-14_16:08:00", "hint": "{\n  \"model\": \"claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022\",\n  \"messages\": [\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"\\nThe collaborative report-writing requirement to be completed:  \\n**Write a simple report on the impact of artificial intelligence on healthcare, focusing on diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient outcomes.**  \\n\\nIt has been decomposed into several parts (writing tasks), as shown below.

Cost savings have been realized through:\n- Earlier disease detection leading to less intensive treatment requirements\n- Reduced hospital readmission rates through better follow-up care\n- More efficient resource utilization in diagnostic procedures\n- Prevention of unnecessary tests and procedures [reference:7]\n\nRehabilitation outcomes have seen significant enhancement through AI-powered tools and monitoring systems. These systems provide:\n- Real-time feedback for physical therapy exercises\n- Personalized adjustment of rehabilitation protocols\n- Continuous monitoring of patient progress\n- Early detection of potential complications [reference:4]\n\nThe impact of preventive interventions has been particularly noteworthy. AI-driven predictive analytics have enabled healthcare providers to identify high-risk patients and implement targeted preventive measures before conditions become severe. This proactive approach has resulted in:\n- Reduced emergency department visits\n- Lower hospitalization rates\n- Better management of chronic conditions\n- Improved patient engagement in preventive care [reference:2][reference:4]\n\n### Healthcare System Efficiency\n\nThe implementation of AI solutions has led to substantial improvements in healthcare system efficiency and resource utilization. Workflow optimization has been observed across various healthcare settings, with institutions reporting:\n- Streamlined patient scheduling and resource allocation\n- Reduced administrative burden on healthcare providers\n- More efficient distribution of clinical workload\n- Enhanced coordination between departments [reference:12]\n\nThe market response to these improvements has been remarkable. The healthcare AI market is projected to grow from $11.2 billion in 2023 to $427.5 billion by 2032, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 47.6% [reference:1]. This extraordinary growth reflects both the proven benefits of AI implementation and increasing confidence in AI technologies among healthcare providers and institutions.\n\nAdoption trends show increasing trust levels among healthcare professionals, particularly in areas where AI has demonstrated consistent reliability. Healthcare organizations are responding with strategic budget allocations for AI initiatives, prioritizing:\n- Infrastructure development for AI implementation\n- Staff training and development programs\n- Integration of AI tools with existing systems\n- Ongoing evaluation and optimization of AI solutions [reference:15]\n\nBudget allocation patterns in healthcare organizations reflect this growing commitment to AI integration. Major institutions like Mayo Clinic and HCA Healthcare are leading the way with comprehensive AI strategies, demonstrating the scalability and sustainability of AI investments in healthcare settings [reference:12][reference:15]. These investments are increasingly viewed as essential for maintaining competitive advantage and ensuring optimal patient care in modern healthcare environments.\n\nThe cumulative impact of these improvements is reflected in enhanced patient satisfaction scores, reduced waiting times, and more efficient use of healthcare resources. As AI technologies continue to evolve and mature, their positive impact on patient outcomes and healthcare system efficiency is expected to grow, further transforming the landscape of healthcare delivery.\n\n</article>"}}], "add_time": "2025-03-14_16:08:33", "hint": "{\n  \"model\": \"claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022\",\n  \"messages\": [\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"\\nThe collaborative report-writing requirement to be completed:  \\n**Write a simple report on the impact of artificial intelligence on healthcare, focusing on diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient outcomes.**  \\n\\nIt has been decomposed into several parts (writing tasks), as shown below.

Healthcare leaders are interested in AI tools that provide clear value, whether that’s a better clinician experience, …\\nContent: Which AI Solutions Will Healthcare Organizations Adopt in 2025?\\nHealthcare leaders are interested in AI tools that provide clear value, whether that’s a better clinician experience, reduced costs, increased administrative efficiencies or improved patient care. Here are some examples.\\nAmbient Listening Reduces Clinical Documentation\\nMany organizations are already going down the AI path with ambient listening, which are machine learning-powered audio solutions. Used by physicians initially before being expanded to nurses, the voice-recognition technology listens to and analyzes patient-provider conversations in real time, then extracts the relevant information for use in clinical notes, meeting billing and coding requirements. This enables clinicians to focus on the patient rather than having to multitask to complete documentation.\\nA major reason that organizations are choosing ambient listening as a first step into AI is that they’ve evaluated and found clear ROI around these solutions when it comes to clinical efficiency and mitigating burnout.\\nAnother reason is that ambient listening isn’t considered as risky as it was in the past. It now falls into a category of low-hanging fruit in the healthcare AI space, along with chart summarization.\\nPushing for Increased Accuracy and Transparency in Generative AI\\nSome healthcare organizations are beginning to experiment with retrieval-augmented generation. RAG is an AI framework that combines traditional vector database capabilities with LLMs. In other words, users get the benefits of a generative AI-powered chatbot that can access an organization’s more accurate and recent data.\\nRAG allows the organization’s chatbot to produce better answers for staff in Q&A applications. This reduces some of the pitfalls of using generative AI tools.\\nThe use of synthetic data in AI development and testing is another area that will see heightened interest, because having decent data to validate models is a challenge. This is part of a larger trend in model testing and model assurance capabilities. Performance claims for these models will face increasing scrutiny by healthcare organizations.\\nIn the past, organizations didn’t know what questions to ask, but now there’s a lot more education available. Healthcare leaders want to ensure that the models do what they promise. Groups such as the Coalition for Health AI are creating frameworks to do this very thing.\\nDIVE DEEPER: Demystify artificial intelligence adoption for your organization.\\nMachine Vision Improves Patient Care\\nAdding cameras, sensors and microphones to patient rooms enables healthcare organizations to collect more data that can be analyzed by AI platforms to improve care. For example, cameras can detect when a patient has turned over in bed, and the platform can alert care team members that they don’t need to turn the patient manually. Some cameras can also detect when a patient is getting up and alert staff so they can prevent a fall.\\nAs these tools advance and more Internet of Medical Things sensors and cameras are added to patient rooms, more solutions will combine the AI capabilities of machine vision and ambient listening to improve proactive patient care as well as clinical workflows.\\nWill AI Regulation Increase in 2025?\\nThere’s already been an uptick in AI regulation, and we expect that to increase due to the nature of AI and fears of the unknown. Whether it comes from the government or from regulatory agencies and organizations, there will likely be new regulation to ensure AI isn’t used inappropriately. However, it’s important to achieve a balance between regulation and innovation.\\nHealthcare organizations will also become more interested in learning how to comply with existing regulations such as the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology’s HTI-1 Final Rule regarding health data, technology and interoperability.\\nPreparing for AI Adoption in Healthcare\\nAI provides healthcare organizations with exciting possibilities for provider experience and patient care, but being able to use AI tools effectively comes down to IT infrastructure. Have an organization’s speeds and feeds been upgraded to handle these solutions?\\nOrganizations looking to implement AI solutions should also work on getting their data shop in order. Even out-of-the-box, consumable AI solutions require good data governance. The more an organization understands its own data, the easier it is for the IT team to know how a solution will work in the organization’s environment. If the data isn’t in order, then AI implementation is going to be more of a challenge.\\nAI governance is another important factor in achieving implementation success. An organization should have a good definition of what AI is and be able to ensure that the right people exist within the organization to discuss potential risks, ROI and cultural readiness. It’s worth having those discussions early and often to corral the different AI interests inside the organization.\\nCONSIDER: When is the cloud right for healthcare organizations deploying AI?\\nIT leaders also need to consider how to integrate AI solutions into workflows effectively while gaining user buy-in. The solution may be great, but if it’s implemented incorrectly, then you might as well have done nothing at all.\\nMost healthcare organizations have limited budgets; therefore, some AI tools will make the cut while others won’t. Tools that don’t solve an existing problem or provide some form of return on the money being spent will be a lower priority for an organization, which may choose to do what it’s always done instead.\\nOnce healthcare organizations are ready to move to the next step of AI implementation, it can be helpful to collaborate with a technology partner that has experience in the realm. CDW offers data workshops to help healthcare organizations prepare their data for AI. We also offer strategy engagements for modern data platforms and deploying generative AI.\\nWe can also help executive teams level-set on what AI is and isn’t, and how to approach management. Ultimately, we help guide healthcare organizations to ensure that their AI initiative is sustainable and becomes part of their culture.\\nThis article is part of HealthTech’s MonITor blog series.\\n</content>\\n\\nMake your judgment and output according to the requirements, determining whether the webpage content can fulfill the purpose of this search round\\n\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"max_tokens\": 8192,\n  \"cache_name\": \"OpenAIApiProxy.call\"\n}"}

Nearly 300 attendees from Mayo Clinic and other institutions gathered in person and virtually to discuss the challenges and opportunities in applying AI technology to healthcare.\\n\\\"As we are entering the era of artificial intelligence, AI has great potential and is already playing a critical role in revolutionizing healthcare and biomedicine,\\\" said Cui Tao, Ph.D., chair of Mayo Clinic's Department of Artificial Intelligence and Informatics, in her opening remarks. Dr. Tao is the Nancy Peretsman and Robert Scully Chair of AI and Informatics.\\n\\\"Our role as a Research shield enables us to lead innovation and discovery efforts within the AI medicine ecosystem,\\\" adds Dr. Tao. \\\"Through collaborative research, we aim to drive advancements to significantly enhance healthcare outcomes.\\\"\\nAI integrates text, radiology images, digital pathology slides, genomics and other sources of information to assist care teams in defining disease and making predictive analyses to support clinical decision-making. This \\\"multimodal\\\" AI supports healthcare teams, enhancing their ability to develop innovative solutions and improve patient care.\\nDeveloping models and bridging the AI translation gap\\nJohn Halamka, M.D., the Dwight and Dian Diercks President of Mayo Clinic Platform and Michael D. Brennan, M.D., President's Strategic Initiative Professor, was a keynote speaker. He emphasized the need for AI solutions to address global healthcare challenges over the next 20 years.\\n\\\"Culturally, I think we have an imperative to build these new solutions,\\\" he said, noting lower birthrates, higher longevity and higher demand for healthcare in many nations. Automation and AI, he explained, can be part of those solutions, enabling healthcare that is more proactive, less costly, less invasive and more focused on wellness and cures.\\nTo create solutions that benefit global populations, AI developers need access to curated, de-identified data with depth, breadth and heterogeneity, said Dr. Halamka.\\nMayo Clinic hosts the largest curated, de-identified dataset in the world, he said, representing 32.5 million patients and growing. Companies such as those participating in the Mayo Clinic Platform's Accelerator program can leverage this data within a secure cloud environment to develop AI models.\\nOnce developed, these models must be validated, approved by regulatory bodies and implemented so that they are easy for clinicians to use.\\n\\\"Handing a data model and an AI model to a physician is not going to get its use and impact. It has to be fully integrated into their workflow,\\\" Dr. Halamka said. \\\"It needs to be just-in-time, there offering appropriate advice without additional effort.\\\"\\nGetting to patients more quickly\\nOther headline speakers were Shauna Overgaard, Ph.D., senior director of AI Strategy and Frameworks, and co-director of the AI Validation and Stewardship Research Program at Mayo Clinic; Thomas Fuchs, D.Sc., dean of Artificial Intelligence and Human Health at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; Anant Madabhushi, Ph.D., executive director for the Emory University Empathetic AI for Health Institute; and Hoifung Poon, general manager at Microsoft Health Futures.\\nIn her keynote, Dr. Overgaard discussed the \\\"AI translation gap\\\" between proof of concept and clinical implementation. The estimated time for translating a basic science discovery to clinical practice is 17 years, she noted. \\\"We know that as we work toward innovation, we absolutely cannot wait 17 years.\\\"\\nTranslating AI solutions into patient care involves overcoming challenges such as gaining clinician trust, ensuring reliability through continuous scientific validation, securing payer approval, and meeting regulatory requirements. These efforts ensure that AI tools efficiently augment and enhance healthcare professionals' expertise and patient care practices.\\n\\\"Part of our work is identifying potential barriers to AI translation and then working together to close those barriers as well as streamline innovation,\\\" she said. This will require scientific rigor and multidisciplinary teamwork. Dr. Overgaard said that a solid translational process should enable stakeholders by addressing transparency, reproducibility, ethics and effectiveness.

Generative AI: a time-saving virtual assistant. With staff stretched thin, …\\nContent: Dec 03, 2024 | 10 minute read\\nFaced with ongoing staff shortages and growing patient demand, healthcare organizations around the world are being compelled to rethink how and where they deliver care. There is also a growing recognition of the importance of reducing the sector’s environmental impact. These 10 healthcare technology trends highlight the potential of innovation to help deliver better care to more people, in a sustainable way.\\nWith staff stretched thin, healthcare leaders are turning to automation to reduce the burden on healthcare professionals. The 2024 Philips Future Health Index report showed that 92% of surveyed healthcare leaders think automation is critical for addressing staff shortages by relieving them of repetitive tasks and processes. An equal percentage believe it will save healthcare professionals time by reducing administrative work, allowing them to spend more time with patients. Generative AI has emerged as a powerful tool supporting this healthcare technology trend, promising to boost clinician productivity in ways that seemed impossible just a few years ago. It’s no wonder that 85% of healthcare leaders worldwide are already investing or plan to invest in generative AI within the next three years. We expect this trend to accelerate in 2025 as the sector continues to explore ways of gaining workflow efficiencies with generative AI. Already today, generative AI can function as a virtual assistant to save healthcare professionals valuable time, using large language models to organize clinical notes and simplify the ways patient information is communicated across teams. In areas like cancer care, generative AI could be a game-changer by summarizing vast historical reports to give care teams immediate insights into a patient’s history. It could also speed up reporting and translate complex medical information into common terms, helping to engage patients more in their own care.\\nWhile AI can significantly streamline administrative tasks and improve patient engagement, its role in healthcare extends beyond automation. AI can also elevate the skills of healthcare professionals. With experienced staff in short supply in many healthcare systems around the world, AI can help simplify complex diagnostics, enabling less experienced professionals to provide high-quality care with confidence. For example, recent advances in AI have made cardiac CT easier to use, making it accessible to more facilities to increase capacity and deliver better cardiac care to more people. In addition, less experienced technicians can rely on remote consultations and expert training for virtual support and reassurance. Similarly, embedding AI in ultrasound systems allows physicians to detect, diagnose and monitor cardiac conditions more confidently and efficiently. Integrating AI into cancer treatments can also enhance patient care by addressing the increased risk of heart disease associated with therapies such as radiation and chemotherapy. Studies show that adult cancer survivors across a wide range of cancers face a 37% higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease [1]. The latest AI technologies can quickly detect signs of cardiotoxicity early in the treatment process by automating and accelerating echocardiographic measurements. Improved reproducibility and shorter study times make the process more efficient and reliable, reducing the risk of treatment delays. That’s good news for cancer patients who may otherwise face serious heart issues alongside their recovery.\\nA silent revolution in surgery is marching ahead as minimally invasive procedures continue to replace traditional open surgeries. These minimally invasive procedures are transforming how providers treat cardiovascular conditions, offering patients faster recovery, reduced pain and fewer complications. With the introduction of new technologies in interventional care, minimally invasive procedures have become more advanced – but also increasingly complex. Physicians need to collect and analyze data from a wide range of sources, such as live 2D X-ray images, 3D ultrasound, Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS), and FFR or iFR physiological flow measurements, all while closely monitoring the patient. That’s why integration of systems, software and devices has become increasingly important. This integration allows interventional physicians to treat patients with greater control and confidence during every stage of minimally invasive cardiac procedures. The latest innovations in image-guided therapy also offer a unique opportunity to expand access to life-saving stroke care. Every two seconds, someone on Earth has a stroke, making it the second leading cause of death and a major cause of long-term disability. Yet less than 5% of our global population has access to mechanical thrombectomy, a minimally invasive treatment that has shown to be highly effective [2]. Expanding access by increasing the number of stroke-ready hospitals and training healthcare professionals in the latest interventional techniques is a cause that Philips is committed to, in partnership with the World Stroke Organization.\\nIn critical care, time is crucial – yet always in short supply. Healthcare professionals often lose valuable time pulling patient data together from disparate sources. An open ecosystem approach to patient monitoring can help overcome this challenge by allowing data to flow freely across healthcare technology from different vendors. This creates a unified, standardized patient view that is accessible from anywhere in the hospital. In 2025, expect further advances in patient monitoring based on this open ecosystem approach to healthcare technology. Medical device integration and vendor-neutral interoperability in critical care are already helping healthcare organizations improve clinical efficiency and data accuracy, while freeing up staff to focus on providing patient-centered care. Advancing common interoperability standards with industry partners will further enhance this approach, giving systems and devices a common language to ‘speak to each other’ so that patient information can be shared even more easily. By breaking down data silos, we will also see further development of algorithms that can help care providers predict and prevent adverse patient events. We are just beginning to explore the potential of advanced analytics in critical care, using smart rules to provide care teams with actionable alerts for emerging events. In the future, AI will offer increasingly personalized recommendations by comparing the full patient picture with thousands of similar cases to help determine the best approach for each patient.\\nWhile the previous four healthcare technology trends all focus on improving hospital care, there is an equally important trend that will continue to gain traction in 2025: the ongoing shift to managing health outside of the hospital. Hospital-at-home programs for patients who need acute-level care continue to be on the rise, allowing patients to receive high standards of care wherever they are, not just in hospital settings. Remote patient monitoring plays a critical role in this shift by providing healthcare professionals with real-time data to manage patient care from a distance. It has also been shown to be effective in reducing hospital readmissions for patients with chronic diseases such as congestive heart failure and is increasingly used in post-operative monitoring for early and safe patient discharge.

Now that the dust is …\\nContent: Alexander Podgornyy, CEO @ IT Medical, software development company, specializing in custom AI-powered solutions for the healthcare sector.\\nIn 2024, the healthcare industry explored different use cases for AI to improve care, streamline administrative workflows and increase efficiency. Now that the dust is beginning to settle, healthcare organizations are focused on getting real value from AI in 2025.\\nWhile the AI hype persists, administrators are now more focused on securing a clear return on investment (ROI). They are prioritizing technologies that deliver immediate benefits and holding off on those that aren’t fully developed.\\nAs the managing director and founder of IT Medical, I’ve seen how AI can transform healthcare by enhancing patient outcomes and streamlining clinical workflows. My work in health tech has fueled my passion for using AI to solve real-world challenges.\\nIn this article, I’ll explore five key areas that I believe will become increasingly important in 2025 as organizations adopt AI to achieve meaningful value.\\n1. AI-Driven Genomics For Precision Medicine\\nAI has revolutionized genomic medicine, paving the way for rapid advancements in precision medicine, a key focus for the future. Cancer is recognized as a disease of the genome. However, our inability to effectively manage and analyze large volumes of genomic data has slowed progress across research and clinical applications. AI-driven genomics promises rapid improvements in cancer care by overcoming these challenges.\\nFor instance, a 2024 paper leveraged AI to analyze large genomics and other omics datasets to predict survival outcomes for patients with pancreatic cancer. This demonstrated AI’s ability to generate actionable insights from large volumes of diverse data. Another paper from 2024 used machine learning to identify complex genomic variants associated with psychiatric disorders from standard genomics datasets.\\nThese studies deepen our understanding of individual disease risks and support personalized treatment and prevention strategies.\\n2. Next-Generation Medical Imaging\\nA cornerstone of diagnostics for cancer and other diseases, medical imaging has already benefited enormously from AI-driven processes, and 2025 promises further achievements.\\nA study published in January 2025 demonstrated AI’s real-world, large-scale implementation in medical imaging and its benefits to patient care. The research involved the optional AI-assisted mammography screening of 260,739 women from 463,094 patients. With AI support, radiologists increased breast cancer detection by 17.6% and lowered recall rates. Additionally, the AI group had a higher positive predictive value for recalls than the control group.\\nGE Healthcare’s Roland Rott predicts that “2025 will showcase many more examples of AI’s ability to improve the lives of cancer patients and the care offered by their providers.” AI not only benefits diagnostic accuracy and supports clinical decision making but also enables faster radiology workflows and reduced costs.\\n3. Generative AI For Clinical Documentation And Support\\nTechnological developments like electronic health records (EHR) have improved clinical workflows but have led to problems like clinician burnout and documentation burdens. In 2025, AI promises to help reduce these burdens by providing more accurate and comprehensive support during clinical documentation procedures.\\nAI-powered scribes can lead to a 170% increase in recording speed compared to in-person scribes, and the use of AI for documentation removes the need for manual documentation by clinicians, representing a potential 90% reduction in time spent on administrative tasks.\\nIn a study of more than 100,000 virtual healthcare encounters, clinicians assessed AI-conducted patient interviews and diagnoses. Upon review, they agreed with the AI-generated diagnoses in 84.2% of cases and the top-ranked diagnoses in 60.9% of cases. These results demonstrate AI’s effectiveness in supporting clinical diagnosis in addition to routine documentation tasks.\\n4. Integration of AI And IoMT\\nThe Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is an interconnected system of medical devices and other technologies that track health parameters and monitor patients. First mentioned in 1999, the IoMT has grown to an estimated market value of 97.7% billion in 2025.\\nThe IoMT enables patients to take tests at home, receive reminders to take medicine and allows for real-time monitoring. Wearable technologies are a central pillar of the IoMT, allowing health parameters to be recorded and shared with high accuracy. The data collected by these devices includes but is not limited to blood glucose levels, electrocardiogram readings, skin temperature and respiration rates. This makes them indispensable for tracking chronic diseases such as diabetes and predicting acute health events.\\nFor instance, a randomized controlled trial found that daily remote monitoring of cardiovascular parameters and integrating these data within neural network modeling significantly improved risk stratification and appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) treatments. Another randomized controlled trial found continuous glucose monitoring resulted in a statistically significant reduction in hypoglycemia.\\n5. AI-Driven Remote Patient Monitoring\\nAn essential role of AI lies in remote patient engagement and monitoring. AI-powered assistants mean patients don’t need to rely on non-personalized online information. Instead, they can query symptoms against a personalized system that accounts for their medical history, including recent real-time data.\\nA study found that 90% of patients using AI assistants reported receiving useful information for their health problems and perceived it as a helpful diagnostic tool. A paper from January 2025 established a model called CRAFT-MD for testing the applicability of AI models for patient engagement, medical history tracking and questioning, highlighting areas for improvement as these tools become more widespread within healthcare.\\nUltimately, AI-driven remote patient engagement is poised to significantly enhance personalized healthcare and improve patient outcomes as its applications expand.\\nConclusion\\nIn 2025, AI innovations look set to transform healthcare by facilitating precision medicine, improving diagnostic accuracy, enhancing patient experience and streamlining clinical workflows. Early adopters who leverage AI-driven genomics, next-generation imaging, advanced clinical documentation and integrated IoMT systems are poised to achieve significant ROI and better patient outcomes in 2025.\\nTo adopt AI successfully, focus on areas where it delivers immediate value, like enhancing diagnostics or reducing administrative tasks. Ensure smooth integration with existing systems, invest in staff training to boost AI literacy and choose a provider with proven healthcare AI expertise for reliable, long-term support.\\nAs more healthcare providers embrace these transformative AI solutions, the industry stands on the brink of a new era marked by efficiency, innovation and improved health.\\nForbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives.

A report from the National Academy of Medicine identified three potential benefits of AI in healthcare: improving outcomes for both patients and clinical teams, lowering …\\nContent: With the widespread media coverage in recent months, it’s likely that you’ve heard about artificial intelligence (AI) — technology that enables computers to do things that would otherwise require a human’s brain. In other words, machines can be given access to large amounts of information, and trained to solve problems, spot patterns and make recommendations. Common examples of AI in everyday life are virtual assistants like Alexa and Siri.\\nWhat you might not know is that AI has been and is being used for a variety of healthcare applications. Here’s a look at how AI can be helpful in healthcare, and what to watch for as it evolves.\\nWhat can AI technology in healthcare do for me?\\nA report from the National Academy of Medicine identified three potential benefits of AI in healthcare: improving outcomes for both patients and clinical teams, lowering healthcare costs, and benefitting population health.\\nFrom preventive screenings to diagnosis and treatment, AI is being used throughout the continuum of care today. Here are two examples:\\nPreventive care\\nCancer screenings that use radiology, like a mammogram or lung cancer screening, can leverage AI to help produce results faster.\\nFor example, in polycystic kidney disease (PKD), researchers discovered that the size of the kidneys — specifically, an attribute known as total kidney volume — correlated with how rapidly kidney function was going to decline in the future.\\nBut assessing total kidney volume, though incredibly informative, involves analyzing dozens of kidney images, one slide after another — a laborious process that can take about 45 minutes per patient. With the innovations developed at the PKD Center at Mayo Clinic, researchers now use artificial intelligence (AI) to automate the process, generating results in a matter of seconds.\\nBradley J. Erickson, M.D., Ph.D., director of Mayo Clinic’s Radiology Informatics Lab, says that AI can complete time-consuming or mundane work for radiology professionals, like tracing tumors and structures, or measuring amounts of fat and muscle. “If a computer can do that first pass, that can help us a lot,” says Dr. Erickson.\\nRisk assessment\\nIn a Mayo Clinic cardiology study, AI successfully identified people at risk of left ventricular dysfunction, which is the medical name for a weak heart pump, even though the individuals had no noticeable symptoms. And that’s far from the only intersection of cardiology and AI.\\n“We have an AI model now that can incidentally say, ‘Hey, you’ve got a lot of coronary artery calcium, and you’re at high risk for a heart attack or a stroke in five or 10 years,’ ” says Bhavik Patel, M.D., M.B.A., the chief artificial intelligence officer at Mayo Clinic in Arizona.\\nHow can AI technology advance medicine and public health?\\nWhen it comes to supporting the overall health of a population, AI can help people manage chronic illnesses themselves — think asthma, diabetes and high blood pressure — by connecting certain people with relevant screening and therapy, and reminding them to take steps in their care, such as take medication.\\nAI also can help promote information on disease prevention online, reaching large numbers of people quickly, and even analyze text on social media to predict outbreaks. Considering the example of a widespread public health crisis, think of how these examples might have supported people during the early stages of COVID-19. For example, a study found that internet searches for terms related to COVID-19 were correlated with actual COVID-19 cases. Here, AI could have been used to predict where an outbreak would happen, and then help officials know how to best communicate and make decisions to help stop the spread.\\nHow can AI solutions assist in providing superior patient care?\\nYou might think that healthcare from a computer isn’t equal to what a human can provide. That’s true in many situations, but it isn’t always the case.\\nStudies have shown that in some situations, AI can do a more accurate job than humans. For example, AI has done a more accurate job than current pathology methods in predicting who will survive malignant mesothelioma, which is a type of cancer that impacts the internal organs. AI is used to identify colon polyps and has been shown to improve colonoscopy accuracy and diagnose colorectal cancer as accurately as skilled endoscopists can.\\nIn a study of a social media forum, most people asking healthcare questions preferred responses from an AI-powered chatbot over those from physicians, ranking the chatbot’s answers higher in quality and empathy. However, the researchers conducting this study emphasize that their results only suggest the value of such chatbots in answering patients’ questions, and recommend it be followed up with a more convincing study.\\nHow can physicians use AI and machine learning in healthcare?\\nOne of the key things that AI may be able to do to help healthcare professionals is save them time. For example:\\n- Keeping up with current advances. When physicians are actively participating in caring for people and other clinical duties, it can be challenging for them to keep pace with evolving technological advances that support care. AI can work with huge volumes of information — from medical journals to healthcare records — and highlight the most relevant pieces.\\n- Taking care of tedious work. When a healthcare professional must complete tasks like writing clinical notes or filling out forms, AI could potentially complete the task faster than traditional methods, even if revision was needed to refine the first pass AI makes.\\nDespite the potential for AI to save time for healthcare professionals, AI isn’t intended to replace humans. The American Medical Association commonly refers to “augmented intelligence,” which stresses the importance of AI assisting, rather than replacing, healthcare professionals. In the case of current AI applications and technology, healthcare professionals are still needed to provide:\\n- Clinical context for the algorithms that train AI.\\n- Accurate and relevant information for AI to analyze.\\n- Translation of AI findings to be meaningful for patients.\\nA helpful comparison to reiterate the collaborative nature needed between AI and humans for healthcare is that in most cases, a human pilot is still needed to fly a plane. Although technology has enabled quite a bit of automation in flying today, people are needed to make adjustments, interpret the equipment’s data, and take over in cases of emergency.\\nWhat are the drawbacks of AI in healthcare?\\nDespite the many exciting possibilities for AI in healthcare, there are some risks to weigh:\\n- If not properly trained, AI can lead to bias and discrimination. For example, if AI is trained on electronic health records, it is building only on people that can access healthcare and is perpetuating any human bias captured within the records.\\n- AI chatbots can generate medical advice that is misleading or false, which is why there’s a need for effectively regulating their use.\\nWhere can AI solutions take the healthcare industry next?\\nAs AI continues to evolve and play a more prominent role in healthcare, the need for effective regulation and use becomes more critical. That’s why Mayo Clinic is a member of Health AI Partnership, which is focused on helping healthcare organizations evaluate and implement AI effectively, equitably and safely.\\nIn terms of the possibilities for healthcare professionals to further integrate AI, Mark D.

The health system will continue a phased deployment over the next year to remaining eligible providers, Amy Williams, executive dean of practice at Mayo, said in a statement to Healthcare Dive.\\n- Mayo and Abridge — along with electronic health record vendor Epic — have already been working together to develop an AI documentation product for nurses announced last summer.\\nDive Insight:\\nFounded in 2018, Abridge has rolled out its documentation assistant to a number of health systems over the past year. The product records conversations between providers and patients, and then drafts a clinical note for review.\\nLast month, the company said it would deploy the product at Michigan-based Corewell Health in one of Abridge’s larger health system partnerships, according to CEO Shiv Rao. Abridge has also recently notched deals with Duke Health, Johns Hopkins Medicine and Kaiser Permanente.\\nMayo is also an AI developer in its own right, with more than 200 projects in different stages, according to the provider’s website. The health system performed a “rigorous clinical note quality assessment” to ensure the documentation tool would meet its standards, according to a press release.\\nUsing AI for clinical documentation has become a competitive space for technology companies, with firms like Microsoft-owned Nuance Communications, Suki, Amazon, Veradigm and Oracle offering their own tools.\\nProponents argue notetaking is ripe for AI innovation, given the long-documented challenges by providers who say the hours they spend on administrative work can impede patient care.\\nAI generally has become one of the most exciting technologies for the healthcare sector, spurring increased venture capital investment in healthcare startups last year, according to Silicon Valley Bank. Abridge raised $150 million in a Series C funding round nearly a year ago.\\nStill, deploying AI products at health systems can be challenging, as inaccurate or biased tools could pose risks to patient care and safety. Last week, the HHS laid out a strategic plan for overseeing the rollout of AI in the healthcare sector.\\n</content>\\n\\nMake your judgment and output according to the requirements, determining whether the webpage content can fulfill the purpose of this search round\\n\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"max_tokens\": 8192,\n  \"cache_name\": \"OpenAIApiProxy.call\"\n}"}

Our recent AI breakthroughs provide unprecedented opportunities to make healthcare more accessible, personalized and effective for everyone, and to significantly accelerate scientific discovery. Here’s an update on our progress, how we’re collaborating with partners to bring AI to global healthcare settings and our recently announced AI co-scientist.\\nAI is making accurate health information more accessible\\nGoogle is often the first place people turn to when they are looking for answers to health-related questions, so we strive to make sure everyone has access to relevant, high-quality health information in their moment of need. Using Lens, people can take a picture to search skin conditions that are visually similar to what they see on their own skin, and on YouTube, we piloted AI tools with health creators and organizations like Cleveland Clinic to make it easier for them to publish authoritative, high-quality content.\\nFor care providers, we launched MedLM and Search for Healthcare which can provide answers to medical questions. These are available on the Google Cloud Vertex AI platform, helping clinicians make more informed decisions and helping patients receive the precise care they need. Our research into medical factuality ensures that health-related content generated by language models is as reliable and grounded in factual sources as possible.\\nGenerative AI is paving the way for personalized healthcare\\nWith advancements in multimodality and conversational AI, we’re able to reimagine patient care and how it could be personalized for everyone, with an emphasis on preventive healthcare.\\nFrom X-rays to digital health records, medicine is multimodal. Building on our MedLM research, we developed Med-Gemini, next-generation models for healthcare which have Gemini’s superior multimodal and reasoning capabilities and are fine-tuned on de-identified medical data. In published research, Med-Gemini achieved 91.1% accuracy on U.S. medical exam-style questions, and we demonstrated how the models can effectively interpret 3D scans or answer complex clinical questions.\\nWe’re researching how AI systems could serve as conversational diagnostic partners in clinical settings, using Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer (AMIE), a research AI system optimized for diagnostic reasoning and conversations. It is designed to take a “clinical history” and ask intelligent questions to help derive a differential diagnosis and handle discussions with empathy, including in subspecialist domains.\\nMobile and wearable devices are another promising area where generative AI models could provide personalized insights for both healthcare and wellness, using data such as step count and heart rate. We designed the Personal Health Large Language Model, another fine-tuned version of Gemini, which can interpret sensor data and generate insights and recommendations about an individual’s sleep and fitness patterns.\\nAI is improving health outcomes globally\\nEarly diagnosis of disease is critical for improving health outcomes. Over the past decade, we’ve tapped into AI’s imaging and diagnostic capabilities and developed AI models to help detect diseases including breast cancer, lung cancer and diabetic retinopathy. Through partnerships, we’re now bringing these solutions at scale to clinical settings so that more patients can benefit from timely and accurate screenings. The impact is particularly profound in low-resource medical settings and countries with fewer specialist doctors per capita. Over the next decade, our health-tech partners in India and Thailand aim to deliver 6 million diabetic retinopathy screenings at no cost to patients, and Apollo Radiology International will build on our AI models to provide 3 million free screenings across India for tuberculosis, lung cancer and breast cancer. Adding to our various initiatives to address maternal health in Africa, we’re also developing an ML model for cardiotocography, used to predict fetal well-being, and exploring its utility in medical settings with limited resources.\\nWe’re also laying the technological foundations for broader access to healthcare. Our Health AI Developer Foundations include open-weight models and resources to help developers build AI models for healthcare more efficiently. And solutions powered by our Open Health Stack (OHS) — a suite of open-source tools that makes it easier for developers to create next-gen digital health solutions for healthcare workers — have already been deployed across regions in Africa, South Asia and Southeast Asia to support frontline healthcare workers serving millions of patients.\\nAI is accelerating scientific discovery\\nMedicine is rooted in science. Building on AI’s ability to synthesize information and perform complex reasoning tasks, we’re exploring how it could augment scientific and biomedical discovery through our work on AI co-scientist, a multi-agent AI system based on Gemini 2.0. AI co-scientist is designed to function as a collaborative tool for scientists. It’s intended to uncover new, original knowledge and help scientists formulate novel research hypotheses and proposals, building upon prior evidence and tailored to specific research objectives. It has already demonstrated potential in areas such as drug repurposing for acute myeloid leukemia, proposing hypotheses for novel treatment targets for liver fibrosis and explaining mechanisms of horizontal gene transfer underlying antimicrobial resistance — each of which is a complex application and presents a different set of challenges.\\nWe continue to realize the incredible potential of AI to advance science and improve, personalize and democratize access to healthcare. The “magic cycle” where we achieve research breakthroughs and translate them to real world impact is accelerating and expanding in scope. We’ll pursue this opportunity responsibly, in collaboration with global partners, and continue to share our research — in 2024, we published more than 50 papers in which we shared cutting-edge health research, and we recently shared our 2025 Health Impact Report. Ultimately, we believe AI will continue to help advance healthcare and science for the benefit of billions of people.\\n</content>\\n\\nMake your judgment and output according to the requirements, determining whether the webpage content can fulfill the purpose of this search round\\n\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"max_tokens\": 8192,\n  \"cache_name\": \"OpenAIApiProxy.call\"\n}"}

Here’s what to expect in 2025.\\nContent: From Point Solutions to Operational Transformation\\n\\\"We're witnessing a fundamental shift in how AI is deployed in healthcare,\\\" explains Neil Patel, Head of Ventures. \\\"The technology is moving beyond basic automation toward truly autonomous systems capable of handling complex operational workflows end-to-end. What's particularly exciting is how voice AI is evolving to support natural clinician-patient conversations while simultaneously managing documentation and providing real-time clinical decision support.\\\"\\nThis evolution is particularly evident in how data is being integrated and utilized. Multiple streams of information – imaging, lab results, patient history, and real-time monitoring – are being unified into cohesive systems that drive more informed clinical decisions.\\nLindsey Rogers, Director of New Ventures, has observed a significant expansion in AI applications beyond traditional use cases. \\\"Early adopters focused on obvious opportunities like call center optimization and scheduling,\\\" she notes. \\\"But in 2025, we're seeing entirely new applications emerge. Companies are using AI to evaluate the robustness of clinical studies, predict hospital supply chain needs with unprecedented accuracy, and provide practice owners with sophisticated operational insights drawn from vast amounts of previously unstructured data.\\\"\\n\\\"We're witnessing a fundamental shift in how AI is deployed in healthcare.\\\"\\nThe Changing Investment Landscape\\nThe venture landscape in healthcare is experiencing a notable shift. \\\"Traditional venture firms are becoming increasingly selective about early-stage investments,\\\" Patel observes. \\\"They're focusing primarily on AI-enabled companies that can demonstrate immediate impact, while specialist healthcare funds are emerging as the primary backers of tech-enabled services companies.\\\"\\nThis bifurcation is creating fascinating market dynamics. Early-stage companies leveraging AI are achieving significant milestones with far less capital than their predecessors. Meanwhile, Rogers points out a crucial challenge facing established players: \\\"Incumbent and later-stage companies with significant technical debt – sophisticated technology stacks not designed to be AI-native – are beginning to lose major business to earlier stage competitors who can offer more customized solutions at better price points.\\\"\\nWorkforce Innovation and Clinical Impact\\nThe healthcare workforce is undergoing its own revolution. Ryan Schneiter, Managing Director of New Ventures, sees AI technology reshaping how risk-bearing providers approach health outcomes. \\\"We're seeing providers leverage AI for better risk stratification, improved preventative clinical interventions, and enhanced physician productivity,\\\" he explains. \\\"The technology is moving beyond simple task automation to fundamentally changing how clinical teams operate.\\\"\\nThe financial implications are significant, particularly in Revenue Cycle Management. \\\"The true ROI breakthrough lies in AI-driven tools that streamline billing, claims processing, and documentation verification,\\\" Patel notes. \\\"Health systems with significant operational expenses in clinical and non-clinical labor stand to gain substantially from AI adoption, both for productivity gains and, where appropriate, labor optimization.\\\"\\nRegulatory Considerations\\nAs AI becomes more deeply integrated into care delivery and clinical decision support, new challenges are emerging. \\\"Software-as-a-medical-device requirements have come into increased focus,\\\" Schneiter emphasizes. \\\"These requirements will continue to shape how companies approach building AI products and solutions, adding an important layer of complexity to innovation in this space.\\\"\\nLooking Ahead\\nAs we move into 2025, the focus will be on meaningful integration of these emerging technologies. Rogers is particularly optimistic about new opportunities: \\\"As founders and investors better understand AI's capabilities, we expect to see AI enter new healthcare markets with novel offerings while creating new opportunities in traditional sectors where innovation had reached a ceiling without large language models.\\\"\\nThe challenge for healthcare organizations won't be finding AI solutions – it will be selecting the right ones and implementing them effectively. \\\"Success will require not just technological adoption but thoughtful integration that considers workforce impact, clinical workflows, and patient outcomes,\\\" Patel explains. \\\"The organizations that succeed will be those that can navigate this transformation while keeping sight of healthcare's fundamental mission: improving patient outcomes and expanding access to care.\\\"\\nWe continue to be excited by the opportunities ahead and look forward to partnering with innovative companies that are thoughtfully approaching these challenges.\\n</content>\\n\\nMake your judgment and output according to the requirements, determining whether the webpage content can fulfill the purpose of this search round\\n\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"max_tokens\": 8192,\n  \"cache_name\": \"OpenAIApiProxy.call\"\n}"}

But how do chatbots do when guiding treatment and care after the diagnosis? For example, how long before surgery should a patient stop taking prescribed blood thinners? Should a patient’s treatment protocol change if they’ve had adverse reactions to similar drugs in the past? These sorts of questions don’t have a textbook right or wrong answer — it’s up to physicians to use their judgment.\\nJonathan H. Chen, MD, PhD, assistant professor of medicine, and a team of researchers are exploring whether chatbots, a type of large language model, or LLM, can effectively answer such nuanced questions, and whether physicians supported by chatbots perform better.\\nThe answers, it turns out, are yes and yes. The research team tested how a chatbot performed when faced with a variety of clinical crossroads. A chatbot on its own outperformed doctors who could access only an internet search and medical references, but armed with their own LLM, the doctors, from multiple regions and institutions across the United States, kept up with the chatbots.\\n“For years I’ve said that, when combined, human plus computer is going to do better than either one by itself,” Chen said. “I think this study challenges us to think about that more critically and ask ourselves, ‘What is a computer good at? What is a human good at?’ We may need to rethink where we use and combine those skills and for which tasks we recruit AI.”\\nA study detailing these results published in Nature Medicine on Feb. 5. Chen and Adam Rodman, MD, assistant professor at Harvard University, are co-senior authors. Postdoctoral scholars Ethan Goh, MD, and Robert Gallo, MD, are co-lead author.\\nBoosted by chatbots\\nIn October 2024, Chen and Goh led a team that ran a study, published in JAMA Network Open, that tested how the chatbot performed when diagnosing diseases and that found its accuracy was higher than that of doctors, even if they were using a chatbot. The current paper digs into the squishier side of medicine, evaluating chatbot and physician performance on questions that fall into a category called “clinical management reasoning.”\\nGoh explains the difference like this: Imagine you’re using a map app on your phone to guide you to a certain destination. Using an LLM to diagnose a disease is sort of like using the map to pinpoint the correct location. How you get there is the management reasoning part — do you take backroads because there’s traffic? Stay the course, bumper to bumper? Or wait and hope the roads clear up?\\nIn a medical context, these decisions can get tricky. Say a doctor incidentally discovers a hospitalized patient has a sizeable mass in the upper part of the lung. What would the next steps be? The doctor (or chatbot) should recognize that a large nodule in the upper lobe of the lung statistically has a high chance of spreading throughout the body. The doctor could immediately take a biopsy of the mass, schedule the procedure for a later date or order imaging to try to learn more.\\nDetermining which approach is best suited for the patient comes down to a host of details, starting with the patient’s known preferences. Are they reticent to undergo an invasive procedure? Does the patient’s history show a lack of following up on appointments? Is the hospital’s health system reliable when organizing follow-up appointments? What about referrals? These types of contextual factors are crucial to consider, Chen said.\\nThe team designed a trial to study clinical management reasoning performance in three groups: the chatbot alone, 46 doctors with chatbot support, and 46 doctors with access only to internet search and medical references. They selected five de-identified patient cases and gave them to the chatbot and to the doctors, all of whom provided a written response that detailed what they would do in each case, why and what they considered when making the decision.\\nIn addition, the researchers tapped a group of board-certified doctors to create a rubric that would qualify a medical judgment or decision as appropriately assessed. The decisions were then scored against the rubric.\\nTo the team’s surprise, the chatbot outperformed the doctors who had access only to the internet and medical references, ticking more items on the rubric than the doctors did. But the doctors who were paired with a chatbot performed as well as the chatbot alone.\\nA future of chatbot doctors?\\nExactly what gave the physician-chatbot collaboration a boost is up for debate. Does using the LLM force doctors to be more thoughtful about the case? Or is the LLM providing guidance that the doctors wouldn’t have thought of on their own? It’s a future direction of exploration, Chen said.\\nThe positive outcomes for chatbots and physicians paired with chatbots beg an ever-popular question: Are AI doctors on their way?\\n“Perhaps it’s a point in AI’s favor,” Chen said. But rather than replacing physicians, the results suggest that doctors might want to welcome a chatbot assist. “This doesn’t mean patients should skip the doctor and go straight to chatbots. Don’t do that,” he said. “There’s a lot of good information out there, but there’s also bad information. The skill we all have to develop is discerning what’s credible and what’s not right. That’s more important now than ever.”\\nResearchers from VA Palo Alto Health Care System, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard University, University of Minnesota, University of Virginia, Microsoft and Kaiser contributed to this work.\\nThe study was funded by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, the Stanford Clinical Excellence Research Center and the VA Advanced Fellowship in Medical Informatics.\\nStanford’s Department of Medicine also supported the work.\\n</content>\\n\\nMake your judgment and output according to the requirements, determining whether the webpage content can fulfill the purpose of this search round\\n\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"max_tokens\": 8192,\n  \"cache_name\": \"OpenAIApiProxy.call\"\n}"}

Here are some examples.\\nAmbient Listening Reduces Clinical Documentation\\nMany organizations are already going down the AI path with ambient listening, which are machine learning-powered audio solutions. Used by physicians initially before being expanded to nurses, the voice-recognition technology listens to and analyzes patient-provider conversations in real time, then extracts the relevant information for use in clinical notes, meeting billing and coding requirements. This enables clinicians to focus on the patient rather than having to multitask to complete documentation.\\nA major reason that organizations are choosing ambient listening as a first step into AI is that they’ve evaluated and found clear ROI around these solutions when it comes to clinical efficiency and mitigating burnout.\\nAnother reason is that ambient listening isn’t considered as risky as it was in the past. It now falls into a category of low-hanging fruit in the healthcare AI space, along with chart summarization.\\nPushing for Increased Accuracy and Transparency in Generative AI\\nSome healthcare organizations are beginning to experiment with retrieval-augmented generation. RAG is an AI framework that combines traditional vector database capabilities with LLMs. In other words, users get the benefits of a generative AI-powered chatbot that can access an organization’s more accurate and recent data.\\nRAG allows the organization’s chatbot to produce better answers for staff in Q&A applications. This reduces some of the pitfalls of using generative AI tools.\\nThe use of synthetic data in AI development and testing is another area that will see heightened interest, because having decent data to validate models is a challenge. This is part of a larger trend in model testing and model assurance capabilities. Performance claims for these models will face increasing scrutiny by healthcare organizations.\\nIn the past, organizations didn’t know what questions to ask, but now there’s a lot more education available. Healthcare leaders want to ensure that the models do what they promise. Groups such as the Coalition for Health AI are creating frameworks to do this very thing.\\nDIVE DEEPER: Demystify artificial intelligence adoption for your organization.\\nMachine Vision Improves Patient Care\\nAdding cameras, sensors and microphones to patient rooms enables healthcare organizations to collect more data that can be analyzed by AI platforms to improve care. For example, cameras can detect when a patient has turned over in bed, and the platform can alert care team members that they don’t need to turn the patient manually. Some cameras can also detect when a patient is getting up and alert staff so they can prevent a fall.\\nAs these tools advance and more Internet of Medical Things sensors and cameras are added to patient rooms, more solutions will combine the AI capabilities of machine vision and ambient listening to improve proactive patient care as well as clinical workflows.\\nWill AI Regulation Increase in 2025?\\nThere’s already been an uptick in AI regulation, and we expect that to increase due to the nature of AI and fears of the unknown. Whether it comes from the government or from regulatory agencies and organizations, there will likely be new regulation to ensure AI isn’t used inappropriately. However, it’s important to achieve a balance between regulation and innovation.\\nHealthcare organizations will also become more interested in learning how to comply with existing regulations such as the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology’s HTI-1 Final Rule regarding health data, technology and interoperability.\\nPreparing for AI Adoption in Healthcare\\nAI provides healthcare organizations with exciting possibilities for provider experience and patient care, but being able to use AI tools effectively comes down to IT infrastructure. Have an organization’s speeds and feeds been upgraded to handle these solutions?\\nOrganizations looking to implement AI solutions should also work on getting their data shop in order. Even out-of-the-box, consumable AI solutions require good data governance. The more an organization understands its own data, the easier it is for the IT team to know how a solution will work in the organization’s environment. If the data isn’t in order, then AI implementation is going to be more of a challenge.\\nAI governance is another important factor in achieving implementation success. An organization should have a good definition of what AI is and be able to ensure that the right people exist within the organization to discuss potential risks, ROI and cultural readiness. It’s worth having those discussions early and often to corral the different AI interests inside the organization.\\nCONSIDER: When is the cloud right for healthcare organizations deploying AI?\\nIT leaders also need to consider how to integrate AI solutions into workflows effectively while gaining user buy-in. The solution may be great, but if it’s implemented incorrectly, then you might as well have done nothing at all.\\nMost healthcare organizations have limited budgets; therefore, some AI tools will make the cut while others won’t. Tools that don’t solve an existing problem or provide some form of return on the money being spent will be a lower priority for an organization, which may choose to do what it’s always done instead.\\nOnce healthcare organizations are ready to move to the next step of AI implementation, it can be helpful to collaborate with a technology partner that has experience in the realm. CDW offers data workshops to help healthcare organizations prepare their data for AI. We also offer strategy engagements for modern data platforms and deploying generative AI.\\nWe can also help executive teams level-set on what AI is and isn’t, and how to approach management. Ultimately, we help guide healthcare organizations to ensure that their AI initiative is sustainable and becomes part of their culture.\\nThis article is part of HealthTech’s MonITor blog series.\\n</content>\\n\\nOrganize and extract as required, focusing solely on the webpage content itself.

A report from the National Academy of Medicine identified three potential benefits of AI in healthcare: improving outcomes for both patients and clinical teams, lowering …\\nContent: With the widespread media coverage in recent months, it’s likely that you’ve heard about artificial intelligence (AI) — technology that enables computers to do things that would otherwise require a human’s brain. In other words, machines can be given access to large amounts of information, and trained to solve problems, spot patterns and make recommendations. Common examples of AI in everyday life are virtual assistants like Alexa and Siri.\\nWhat you might not know is that AI has been and is being used for a variety of healthcare applications. Here’s a look at how AI can be helpful in healthcare, and what to watch for as it evolves.\\nWhat can AI technology in healthcare do for me?\\nA report from the National Academy of Medicine identified three potential benefits of AI in healthcare: improving outcomes for both patients and clinical teams, lowering healthcare costs, and benefitting population health.\\nFrom preventive screenings to diagnosis and treatment, AI is being used throughout the continuum of care today. Here are two examples:\\nPreventive care\\nCancer screenings that use radiology, like a mammogram or lung cancer screening, can leverage AI to help produce results faster.\\nFor example, in polycystic kidney disease (PKD), researchers discovered that the size of the kidneys — specifically, an attribute known as total kidney volume — correlated with how rapidly kidney function was going to decline in the future.\\nBut assessing total kidney volume, though incredibly informative, involves analyzing dozens of kidney images, one slide after another — a laborious process that can take about 45 minutes per patient. With the innovations developed at the PKD Center at Mayo Clinic, researchers now use artificial intelligence (AI) to automate the process, generating results in a matter of seconds.\\nBradley J. Erickson, M.D., Ph.D., director of Mayo Clinic’s Radiology Informatics Lab, says that AI can complete time-consuming or mundane work for radiology professionals, like tracing tumors and structures, or measuring amounts of fat and muscle. “If a computer can do that first pass, that can help us a lot,” says Dr. Erickson.\\nRisk assessment\\nIn a Mayo Clinic cardiology study, AI successfully identified people at risk of left ventricular dysfunction, which is the medical name for a weak heart pump, even though the individuals had no noticeable symptoms. And that’s far from the only intersection of cardiology and AI.\\n“We have an AI model now that can incidentally say, ‘Hey, you’ve got a lot of coronary artery calcium, and you’re at high risk for a heart attack or a stroke in five or 10 years,’ ” says Bhavik Patel, M.D., M.B.A., the chief artificial intelligence officer at Mayo Clinic in Arizona.\\nHow can AI technology advance medicine and public health?\\nWhen it comes to supporting the overall health of a population, AI can help people manage chronic illnesses themselves — think asthma, diabetes and high blood pressure — by connecting certain people with relevant screening and therapy, and reminding them to take steps in their care, such as take medication.\\nAI also can help promote information on disease prevention online, reaching large numbers of people quickly, and even analyze text on social media to predict outbreaks. Considering the example of a widespread public health crisis, think of how these examples might have supported people during the early stages of COVID-19. For example, a study found that internet searches for terms related to COVID-19 were correlated with actual COVID-19 cases. Here, AI could have been used to predict where an outbreak would happen, and then help officials know how to best communicate and make decisions to help stop the spread.\\nHow can AI solutions assist in providing superior patient care?\\nYou might think that healthcare from a computer isn’t equal to what a human can provide. That’s true in many situations, but it isn’t always the case.\\nStudies have shown that in some situations, AI can do a more accurate job than humans. For example, AI has done a more accurate job than current pathology methods in predicting who will survive malignant mesothelioma, which is a type of cancer that impacts the internal organs. AI is used to identify colon polyps and has been shown to improve colonoscopy accuracy and diagnose colorectal cancer as accurately as skilled endoscopists can.\\nIn a study of a social media forum, most people asking healthcare questions preferred responses from an AI-powered chatbot over those from physicians, ranking the chatbot’s answers higher in quality and empathy. However, the researchers conducting this study emphasize that their results only suggest the value of such chatbots in answering patients’ questions, and recommend it be followed up with a more convincing study.\\nHow can physicians use AI and machine learning in healthcare?\\nOne of the key things that AI may be able to do to help healthcare professionals is save them time. For example:\\n- Keeping up with current advances. When physicians are actively participating in caring for people and other clinical duties, it can be challenging for them to keep pace with evolving technological advances that support care. AI can work with huge volumes of information — from medical journals to healthcare records — and highlight the most relevant pieces.\\n- Taking care of tedious work. When a healthcare professional must complete tasks like writing clinical notes or filling out forms, AI could potentially complete the task faster than traditional methods, even if revision was needed to refine the first pass AI makes.\\nDespite the potential for AI to save time for healthcare professionals, AI isn’t intended to replace humans. The American Medical Association commonly refers to “augmented intelligence,” which stresses the importance of AI assisting, rather than replacing, healthcare professionals. In the case of current AI applications and technology, healthcare professionals are still needed to provide:\\n- Clinical context for the algorithms that train AI.\\n- Accurate and relevant information for AI to analyze.\\n- Translation of AI findings to be meaningful for patients.\\nA helpful comparison to reiterate the collaborative nature needed between AI and humans for healthcare is that in most cases, a human pilot is still needed to fly a plane. Although technology has enabled quite a bit of automation in flying today, people are needed to make adjustments, interpret the equipment’s data, and take over in cases of emergency.\\nWhat are the drawbacks of AI in healthcare?\\nDespite the many exciting possibilities for AI in healthcare, there are some risks to weigh:\\n- If not properly trained, AI can lead to bias and discrimination. For example, if AI is trained on electronic health records, it is building only on people that can access healthcare and is perpetuating any human bias captured within the records.\\n- AI chatbots can generate medical advice that is misleading or false, which is why there’s a need for effectively regulating their use.\\nWhere can AI solutions take the healthcare industry next?\\nAs AI continues to evolve and play a more prominent role in healthcare, the need for effective regulation and use becomes more critical. That’s why Mayo Clinic is a member of Health AI Partnership, which is focused on helping healthcare organizations evaluate and implement AI effectively, equitably and safely.\\nIn terms of the possibilities for healthcare professionals to further integrate AI, Mark D. Stegall, M.D., a transplant surgeon and researcher at Mayo Clinic in Minnesota says, “I predict AI also will become an important decision-making tool for physicians.”\\nMayo Clinic hopes that AI could help create new ways to diagnose, treat, predict, prevent and cure disease. This might be achieved by:\\n- Selecting and matching patients with the most promising clinical trials.\\n- Developing and setting up remote health-monitoring devices.\\n- Detecting currently imperceptible conditions.\\n- Anticipating disease-risk years in advance.\\nRelevant reading\\nMayo Clinic on Hearing and Balance, 3rd Edition\\nMayo Clinic on Better Hearing and B...Omiting #423 chars\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"max_tokens\": 8192,\n  \"cache_name\": \"OpenAIApiProxy.call\"\n}"}

Now that the dust is beginning to settle, healthcare organizations are focused on getting real value from AI in 2025.\\nWhile the AI hype persists, administrators are now more focused on securing a clear return on investment (ROI). They are prioritizing technologies that deliver immediate benefits and holding off on those that aren’t fully developed.\\nAs the managing director and founder of IT Medical, I’ve seen how AI can transform healthcare by enhancing patient outcomes and streamlining clinical workflows. My work in health tech has fueled my passion for using AI to solve real-world challenges.\\nIn this article, I’ll explore five key areas that I believe will become increasingly important in 2025 as organizations adopt AI to achieve meaningful value.\\n1. AI-Driven Genomics For Precision Medicine\\nAI has revolutionized genomic medicine, paving the way for rapid advancements in precision medicine, a key focus for the future. Cancer is recognized as a disease of the genome. However, our inability to effectively manage and analyze large volumes of genomic data has slowed progress across research and clinical applications. AI-driven genomics promises rapid improvements in cancer care by overcoming these challenges.\\nFor instance, a 2024 paper leveraged AI to analyze large genomics and other omics datasets to predict survival outcomes for patients with pancreatic cancer. This demonstrated AI’s ability to generate actionable insights from large volumes of diverse data. Another paper from 2024 used machine learning to identify complex genomic variants associated with psychiatric disorders from standard genomics datasets.\\nThese studies deepen our understanding of individual disease risks and support personalized treatment and prevention strategies.\\n2. Next-Generation Medical Imaging\\nA cornerstone of diagnostics for cancer and other diseases, medical imaging has already benefited enormously from AI-driven processes, and 2025 promises further achievements.\\nA study published in January 2025 demonstrated AI’s real-world, large-scale implementation in medical imaging and its benefits to patient care. The research involved the optional AI-assisted mammography screening of 260,739 women from 463,094 patients. With AI support, radiologists increased breast cancer detection by 17.6% and lowered recall rates. Additionally, the AI group had a higher positive predictive value for recalls than the control group.\\nGE Healthcare’s Roland Rott predicts that “2025 will showcase many more examples of AI’s ability to improve the lives of cancer patients and the care offered by their providers.” AI not only benefits diagnostic accuracy and supports clinical decision making but also enables faster radiology workflows and reduced costs.\\n3. Generative AI For Clinical Documentation And Support\\nTechnological developments like electronic health records (EHR) have improved clinical workflows but have led to problems like clinician burnout and documentation burdens. In 2025, AI promises to help reduce these burdens by providing more accurate and comprehensive support during clinical documentation procedures.\\nAI-powered scribes can lead to a 170% increase in recording speed compared to in-person scribes, and the use of AI for documentation removes the need for manual documentation by clinicians, representing a potential 90% reduction in time spent on administrative tasks.\\nIn a study of more than 100,000 virtual healthcare encounters, clinicians assessed AI-conducted patient interviews and diagnoses. Upon review, they agreed with the AI-generated diagnoses in 84.2% of cases and the top-ranked diagnoses in 60.9% of cases. These results demonstrate AI’s effectiveness in supporting clinical diagnosis in addition to routine documentation tasks.\\n4. Integration of AI And IoMT\\nThe Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is an interconnected system of medical devices and other technologies that track health parameters and monitor patients. First mentioned in 1999, the IoMT has grown to an estimated market value of 97.7% billion in 2025.\\nThe IoMT enables patients to take tests at home, receive reminders to take medicine and allows for real-time monitoring. Wearable technologies are a central pillar of the IoMT, allowing health parameters to be recorded and shared with high accuracy. The data collected by these devices includes but is not limited to blood glucose levels, electrocardiogram readings, skin temperature and respiration rates. This makes them indispensable for tracking chronic diseases such as diabetes and predicting acute health events.\\nFor instance, a randomized controlled trial found that daily remote monitoring of cardiovascular parameters and integrating these data within neural network modeling significantly improved risk stratification and appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) treatments. Another randomized controlled trial found continuous glucose monitoring resulted in a statistically significant reduction in hypoglycemia.\\n5. AI-Driven Remote Patient Monitoring\\nAn essential role of AI lies in remote patient engagement and monitoring. AI-powered assistants mean patients don’t need to rely on non-personalized online information. Instead, they can query symptoms against a personalized system that accounts for their medical history, including recent real-time data.\\nA study found that 90% of patients using AI assistants reported receiving useful information for their health problems and perceived it as a helpful diagnostic tool. A paper from January 2025 established a model called CRAFT-MD for testing the applicability of AI models for patient engagement, medical history tracking and questioning, highlighting areas for improvement as these tools become more widespread within healthcare.\\nUltimately, AI-driven remote patient engagement is poised to significantly enhance personalized healthcare and improve patient outcomes as its applications expand.\\nConclusion\\nIn 2025, AI innovations look set to transform healthcare by facilitating precision medicine, improving diagnostic accuracy, enhancing patient experience and streamlining clinical workflows. Early adopters who leverage AI-driven genomics, next-generation imaging, advanced clinical documentation and integrated IoMT systems are poised to achieve significant ROI and better patient outcomes in 2025.\\nTo adopt AI successfully, focus on areas where it delivers immediate value, like enhancing diagnostics or reducing administrative tasks. Ensure smooth integration with existing systems, invest in staff training to boost AI literacy and choose a provider with proven healthcare AI expertise for reliable, long-term support.\\nAs more healthcare providers embrace these transformative AI solutions, the industry stands on the brink of a new era marked by efficiency, innovation and improved health.\\nForbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives.

Nearly 300 attendees from Mayo Clinic and other institutions gathered in person and virtually to discuss the challenges and opportunities in applying AI technology to healthcare.\\n\\\"As we are entering the era of artificial intelligence, AI has great potential and is already playing a critical role in revolutionizing healthcare and biomedicine,\\\" said Cui Tao, Ph.D., chair of Mayo Clinic's Department of Artificial Intelligence and Informatics, in her opening remarks. Dr. Tao is the Nancy Peretsman and Robert Scully Chair of AI and Informatics.\\n\\\"Our role as a Research shield enables us to lead innovation and discovery efforts within the AI medicine ecosystem,\\\" adds Dr. Tao. \\\"Through collaborative research, we aim to drive advancements to significantly enhance healthcare outcomes.\\\"\\nAI integrates text, radiology images, digital pathology slides, genomics and other sources of information to assist care teams in defining disease and making predictive analyses to support clinical decision-making. This \\\"multimodal\\\" AI supports healthcare teams, enhancing their ability to develop innovative solutions and improve patient care.\\nDeveloping models and bridging the AI translation gap\\nJohn Halamka, M.D., the Dwight and Dian Diercks President of Mayo Clinic Platform and Michael D. Brennan, M.D., President's Strategic Initiative Professor, was a keynote speaker. He emphasized the need for AI solutions to address global healthcare challenges over the next 20 years.\\n\\\"Culturally, I think we have an imperative to build these new solutions,\\\" he said, noting lower birthrates, higher longevity and higher demand for healthcare in many nations. Automation and AI, he explained, can be part of those solutions, enabling healthcare that is more proactive, less costly, less invasive and more focused on wellness and cures.\\nTo create solutions that benefit global populations, AI developers need access to curated, de-identified data with depth, breadth and heterogeneity, said Dr. Halamka.\\nMayo Clinic hosts the largest curated, de-identified dataset in the world, he said, representing 32.5 million patients and growing. Companies such as those participating in the Mayo Clinic Platform's Accelerator program can leverage this data within a secure cloud environment to develop AI models.\\nOnce developed, these models must be validated, approved by regulatory bodies and implemented so that they are easy for clinicians to use.\\n\\\"Handing a data model and an AI model to a physician is not going to get its use and impact. It has to be fully integrated into their workflow,\\\" Dr. Halamka said. \\\"It needs to be just-in-time, there offering appropriate advice without additional effort.\\\"\\nGetting to patients more quickly\\nOther headline speakers were Shauna Overgaard, Ph.D., senior director of AI Strategy and Frameworks, and co-director of the AI Validation and Stewardship Research Program at Mayo Clinic; Thomas Fuchs, D.Sc., dean of Artificial Intelligence and Human Health at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; Anant Madabhushi, Ph.D., executive director for the Emory University Empathetic AI for Health Institute; and Hoifung Poon, general manager at Microsoft Health Futures.\\nIn her keynote, Dr. Overgaard discussed the \\\"AI translation gap\\\" between proof of concept and clinical implementation. The estimated time for translating a basic science discovery to clinical practice is 17 years, she noted. \\\"We know that as we work toward innovation, we absolutely cannot wait 17 years.\\\"\\nTranslating AI solutions into patient care involves overcoming challenges such as gaining clinician trust, ensuring reliability through continuous scientific validation, securing payer approval, and meeting regulatory requirements. These efforts ensure that AI tools efficiently augment and enhance healthcare professionals' expertise and patient care practices.\\n\\\"Part of our work is identifying potential barriers to AI translation and then working together to close those barriers as well as streamline innovation,\\\" she said. This will require scientific rigor and multidisciplinary teamwork. Dr. Overgaard said that a solid translational process should enable stakeholders by addressing transparency, reproducibility, ethics and effectiveness.

Generative AI: a time-saving virtual assistant. With staff stretched thin, …\\nContent: Dec 03, 2024 | 10 minute read\\nFaced with ongoing staff shortages and growing patient demand, healthcare organizations around the world are being compelled to rethink how and where they deliver care. There is also a growing recognition of the importance of reducing the sector’s environmental impact. These 10 healthcare technology trends highlight the potential of innovation to help deliver better care to more people, in a sustainable way.\\nWith staff stretched thin, healthcare leaders are turning to automation to reduce the burden on healthcare professionals. The 2024 Philips Future Health Index report showed that 92% of surveyed healthcare leaders think automation is critical for addressing staff shortages by relieving them of repetitive tasks and processes. An equal percentage believe it will save healthcare professionals time by reducing administrative work, allowing them to spend more time with patients. Generative AI has emerged as a powerful tool supporting this healthcare technology trend, promising to boost clinician productivity in ways that seemed impossible just a few years ago. It’s no wonder that 85% of healthcare leaders worldwide are already investing or plan to invest in generative AI within the next three years. We expect this trend to accelerate in 2025 as the sector continues to explore ways of gaining workflow efficiencies with generative AI. Already today, generative AI can function as a virtual assistant to save healthcare professionals valuable time, using large language models to organize clinical notes and simplify the ways patient information is communicated across teams. In areas like cancer care, generative AI could be a game-changer by summarizing vast historical reports to give care teams immediate insights into a patient’s history. It could also speed up reporting and translate complex medical information into common terms, helping to engage patients more in their own care.\\nWhile AI can significantly streamline administrative tasks and improve patient engagement, its role in healthcare extends beyond automation. AI can also elevate the skills of healthcare professionals. With experienced staff in short supply in many healthcare systems around the world, AI can help simplify complex diagnostics, enabling less experienced professionals to provide high-quality care with confidence. For example, recent advances in AI have made cardiac CT easier to use, making it accessible to more facilities to increase capacity and deliver better cardiac care to more people. In addition, less experienced technicians can rely on remote consultations and expert training for virtual support and reassurance. Similarly, embedding AI in ultrasound systems allows physicians to detect, diagnose and monitor cardiac conditions more confidently and efficiently. Integrating AI into cancer treatments can also enhance patient care by addressing the increased risk of heart disease associated with therapies such as radiation and chemotherapy. Studies show that adult cancer survivors across a wide range of cancers face a 37% higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease [1]. The latest AI technologies can quickly detect signs of cardiotoxicity early in the treatment process by automating and accelerating echocardiographic measurements. Improved reproducibility and shorter study times make the process more efficient and reliable, reducing the risk of treatment delays. That’s good news for cancer patients who may otherwise face serious heart issues alongside their recovery.\\nA silent revolution in surgery is marching ahead as minimally invasive procedures continue to replace traditional open surgeries. These minimally invasive procedures are transforming how providers treat cardiovascular conditions, offering patients faster recovery, reduced pain and fewer complications. With the introduction of new technologies in interventional care, minimally invasive procedures have become more advanced – but also increasingly complex. Physicians need to collect and analyze data from a wide range of sources, such as live 2D X-ray images, 3D ultrasound, Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS), and FFR or iFR physiological flow measurements, all while closely monitoring the patient. That’s why integration of systems, software and devices has become increasingly important. This integration allows interventional physicians to treat patients with greater control and confidence during every stage of minimally invasive cardiac procedures. The latest innovations in image-guided therapy also offer a unique opportunity to expand access to life-saving stroke care. Every two seconds, someone on Earth has a stroke, making it the second leading cause of death and a major cause of long-term disability. Yet less than 5% of our global population has access to mechanical thrombectomy, a minimally invasive treatment that has shown to be highly effective [2]. Expanding access by increasing the number of stroke-ready hospitals and training healthcare professionals in the latest interventional techniques is a cause that Philips is committed to, in partnership with the World Stroke Organization.\\nIn critical care, time is crucial – yet always in short supply. Healthcare professionals often lose valuable time pulling patient data together from disparate sources. An open ecosystem approach to patient monitoring can help overcome this challenge by allowing data to flow freely across healthcare technology from different vendors. This creates a unified, standardized patient view that is accessible from anywhere in the hospital. In 2025, expect further advances in patient monitoring based on this open ecosystem approach to healthcare technology. Medical device integration and vendor-neutral interoperability in critical care are already helping healthcare organizations improve clinical efficiency and data accuracy, while freeing up staff to focus on providing patient-centered care. Advancing common interoperability standards with industry partners will further enhance this approach, giving systems and devices a common language to ‘speak to each other’ so that patient information can be shared even more easily. By breaking down data silos, we will also see further development of algorithms that can help care providers predict and prevent adverse patient events. We are just beginning to explore the potential of advanced analytics in critical care, using smart rules to provide care teams with actionable alerts for emerging events. In the future, AI will offer increasingly personalized recommendations by comparing the full patient picture with thousands of similar cases to help determine the best approach for each patient.\\nWhile the previous four healthcare technology trends all focus on improving hospital care, there is an equally important trend that will continue to gain traction in 2025: the ongoing shift to managing health outside of the hospital. Hospital-at-home programs for patients who need acute-level care continue to be on the rise, allowing patients to receive high standards of care wherever they are, not just in hospital settings. Remote patient monitoring plays a critical role in this shift by providing healthcare professionals with real-time data to manage patient care from a distance. It has also been shown to be effective in reducing hospital readmissions for patients with chronic diseases such as congestive heart failure and is increasingly used in post-operative monitoring for early and safe patient discharge. Hospitals get to free up scarce beds for patients who need them more urgently, while patients benefit from an improved experience at home. In 2025, we will see further advances in AI and predictive analytics to support remote detection of patient health risks based on vital signs and other data. In fact, our 2024 Future Health Index report shows that remote patient monitoring is the biggest area of planned AI implementation over the next three years, with 41% of healthcare leaders intending to invest in it. This will not only help prevent complications and hospitalizations by enabling timely interventions, but also...Omiting #10255 chars\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"max_tokens\": 8192,\n  \"cache_name\": \"OpenAIApiProxy.call\"\n}"}

Topics discussed include the need for industry collaboration, AI safety and security, and the importance of human connection. Speakers also emphasized how digital tools and AI support staff.\\nSeveral themes echoed across the conference sessions:\\n- Healthcare's most pressing challenges require platform thinking and industry-wide collaboration.\\nFundamental challenges in healthcare include too much disease, increasing demand, and uneven quality across communities and countries. The industry needs easier ways to collaborate to create more cures, provide even more support to staff and make quality care more accessible. - Healthcare needs change — and platform thinking.\\nThe World Health Organization estimates that there will be a shortfall of 10 million health workers by 2030. Platform thinking and emerging technologies will support the work that only healthcare workers can do, ensuring that, as demand increases, the quality of care can stay consistent. Healthcare must change, and platforms present the best opportunity to support that change. - Trust is essential for transformation.\\nHealthcare professionals will only adopt AI-based solutions they can trust. AI solutions need to be mitigated for bias and validated by experts. Validation frameworks, like the ones developed by Mayo Clinic Platform_Validate, provide the evidence to establish the trustworthiness of solutions that can help teams enhance operational efficiency and improve patient care. - Mayo Clinic Platform is the model and conduit for global healthcare transformation.\\nA platform model of healthcare can and will be one of Mayo Clinic's most transformative and far-reaching contributions to the future of healthcare.

Nearly 300 attendees from Mayo Clinic and other institutions gathered in person and virtually to discuss the challenges and opportunities in applying AI technology to healthcare.\\n\\\"As we are entering the era of artificial intelligence, AI has great potential and is already playing a critical role in revolutionizing healthcare and biomedicine,\\\" said Cui Tao, Ph.D., chair of Mayo Clinic's Department of Artificial Intelligence and Informatics, in her opening remarks. Dr. Tao is the Nancy Peretsman and Robert Scully Chair of AI and Informatics.\\n\\\"Our role as a Research shield enables us to lead innovation and discovery efforts within the AI medicine ecosystem,\\\" adds Dr. Tao. \\\"Through collaborative research, we aim to drive advancements to significantly enhance healthcare outcomes.\\\"\\nAI integrates text, radiology images, digital pathology slides, genomics and other sources of information to assist care teams in defining disease and making predictive analyses to support clinical decision-making. This \\\"multimodal\\\" AI supports healthcare teams, enhancing their ability to develop innovative solutions and improve patient care.\\nDeveloping models and bridging the AI translation gap\\nJohn Halamka, M.D., the Dwight and Dian Diercks President of Mayo Clinic Platform and Michael D. Brennan, M.D., President's Strategic Initiative Professor, was a keynote speaker. He emphasized the need for AI solutions to address global healthcare challenges over the next 20 years.\\n\\\"Culturally, I think we have an imperative to build these new solutions,\\\" he said, noting lower birthrates, higher longevity and higher demand for healthcare in many nations. Automation and AI, he explained, can be part of those solutions, enabling healthcare that is more proactive, less costly, less invasive and more focused on wellness and cures.\\nTo create solutions that benefit global populations, AI developers need access to curated, de-identified data with depth, breadth and heterogeneity, said Dr. Halamka.\\nMayo Clinic hosts the largest curated, de-identified dataset in the world, he said, representing 32.5 million patients and growing. Companies such as those participating in the Mayo Clinic Platform's Accelerator program can leverage this data within a secure cloud environment to develop AI models.\\nOnce developed, these models must be validated, approved by regulatory bodies and implemented so that they are easy for clinicians to use.\\n\\\"Handing a data model and an AI model to a physician is not going to get its use and impact. It has to be fully integrated into their workflow,\\\" Dr. Halamka said. \\\"It needs to be just-in-time, there offering appropriate advice without additional effort.\\\"\\nGetting to patients more quickly\\nOther headline speakers were Shauna Overgaard, Ph.D., senior director of AI Strategy and Frameworks, and co-director of the AI Validation and Stewardship Research Program at Mayo Clinic; Thomas Fuchs, D.Sc., dean of Artificial Intelligence and Human Health at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; Anant Madabhushi, Ph.D., executive director for the Emory University Empathetic AI for Health Institute; and Hoifung Poon, general manager at Microsoft Health Futures.\\nIn her keynote, Dr. Overgaard discussed the \\\"AI translation gap\\\" between proof of concept and clinical implementation. The estimated time for translating a basic science discovery to clinical practice is 17 years, she noted. \\\"We know that as we work toward innovation, we absolutely cannot wait 17 years.\\\"\\nTranslating AI solutions into patient care involves overcoming challenges such as gaining clinician trust, ensuring reliability through continuous scientific validation, securing payer approval, and meeting regulatory requirements. These efforts ensure that AI tools efficiently augment and enhance healthcare professionals' expertise and patient care practices.\\n\\\"Part of our work is identifying potential barriers to AI translation and then working together to close those barriers as well as streamline innovation,\\\" she said. This will require scientific rigor and multidisciplinary teamwork. Dr. Overgaard said that a solid translational process should enable stakeholders by addressing transparency, reproducibility, ethics and effectiveness. The AI Summit was hosted by the Department of Artificial Intelligence and Informatics. Hamid Tizhoosh, Ph.D., Artificial Intelligence and Informatics, served as chair of the AI Summit\\n</content>\\n\\nMake your judgment and output according to the requirements, determining whether the webpage content can fulfill the purpose of this search round\\n\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"max_tokens\": 8192,\n  \"cache_name\": \"OpenAIApiProxy.call\"\n}"}

But a new study from Stanford Medicine shows the potential of AI as a facilitator - one that helps doctors and nurses connect to achieve more efficient, effective patient care.\\nThe study, which published in JAMA Internal Medicine last month, describes an AI-based model in use at Stanford Hospital that predicts when a patient is declining and flags the patient's physicians and nurses. Ron Li, MD, a clinical associate professor of medicine and medical informatics director for digital health who is the senior author on the study, said the alert system helps clinicians connect more efficiently and effectively as well as intervene to prevent patients from deteriorating and landing in the intensive care unit.\\nLi, who worked with informatics postdoctoral scholar and lead author Robert Gallo, MD, on the evaluation, discussed their team's approach to harnessing the algorithm and how it fosters clinician connection in a ceaselessly buzzing hospital environment. Lisa Shieh, MD, PhD, clinical professor of medicine; Margaret Smith, executive director of the Healthcare AI Applied Research Team, operations for primary care and population health; and Jerri Westphal, nursing informatics manager, also helped lead the study and the implementation of the AI system.\\nRon Li\\nWhat is a deterioration model and how does AI fit in?\\nThe algorithm is a prediction model that pulls data - such as vital signs, information from electronic health records and lab results - in near-real time to predict whether a patient in the hospital is about to suffer a health decline. Physicians aren't able to monitor all of these data points for every patient all of the time, so the model runs in the background, looking at these values about every 15 minutes. It then uses artificial intelligence to calculate a risk score on the probability the patient is going to deteriorate, and if the patient seems like they might be declining, the model sends an alert to the care team.\\nWhat's the benefit of having such a model run in a hospital?\\nThe big question I want to answer is, \\\"How do we use AI to build a more resilient health system in high-stakes situations?\\\" There are many ways to do that, but one core characteristic for a resilient system is strong communication channels. This model is powered by AI, but the action it triggers, the intervention, is basically a conversation that otherwise may not have happened.\\nNurses and physicians have conversations and handoffs when they change shifts, but it's difficult to standardize these communication channels due to busy schedules and other hospital dynamics. The algorithm can help standardize it and draw clinicians' attention to a patient who may need additional care. Once the alert comes into the nurse and physician simultaneously, it initiates a conversation about what the patient needs to ensure they don't decline to the point of requiring a transfer to the ICU.\\nTell me about how your team implemented and evaluated the model.\\nWe integrated this model, which we did not create, into our workflow, but with a few tweaks. Originally, it sent an alert when the patient was already deteriorating, which we didn't find very helpful. We adjusted the model to focus on predicting ICU transfers and other indicators of health decline.\\nWe wanted to ensure the nursing team was heavily involved and felt empowered to initiate conversations with physicians about adjusting a patient's care. When we evaluated the tool, which we had running for almost 10,000 patients, we saw a significant improvement in clinical outcomes - a 10.4% decrease in deterioration events, which we defined as transfers to the ICU, rapid response team events, or codes - among a subset of 963 patients with risk scores within a \\\"regression discontinuity window,\\\" which basically means they're at the cusp of being high risk. These are patients whose clinical trajectory may not be as obvious to the medical team. For that group of patients, this model was especially helpful for encouraging physicians and nurses to collaborate to determine which patients need extra tending.\\nHow have nurses and physicians responded to the integration of this new model?\\nThe model is far from perfect. The reactions have overall been positive, but there is concern about alert fatigue, since not all alerts are flagging a real decline. When the model was validated on data from patients prior to implementation, we calculated that about 20% of patients flagged by the model did end up experiencing a deterioration event within six to 18 hours. At this point, even though it's not a completely accurate model, it's accurate enough to warrant a conversation. It shows that the algorithm doesn't have to be perfect for it to be effective.\\nWith that said, we want to improve the accuracy; you need to do that to improve trust. That's what we're working on now.\\nFor more news about responsible AI in health and medicine, sign up for the RAISE Health newsletter.\\nRegister for the RAISE Health Symposium on May 14.\\n</content>\\n\\nMake your judgment and output according to the requirements, determining whether the webpage content can fulfill the purpose of this search round\\n\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"max_tokens\": 8192,\n  \"cache_name\": \"OpenAIApiProxy.call\"\n}"}

But how do leading institutions like the Mayo Clinic turn AI’s potential into real-world impact? With a strategic approach and a commitment to responsible innovation, Mayo Clinic is setting a new benchmark for how AI can enhance patient care and streamline medical workflows.\\nKey speakers\\n- Moderator: Gabriel Perna, Modern Healthcare’s Digital Health Editor\\n- Speaker: Cris Ross, Mayo Clinic’s Former CIO\\nThese insights came from our ScaleUp:AI event in November 2024, an industry-leading global conference that features topics across technologies and industries. Watch the full session below:\\nKey takeaways\\n- Workforce shortages: AI can help alleviate the strain by automating tasks and improving efficiency.\\n- Data complexity: Healthcare generates about 30% of the world’s data, growing at an annual rate of 36%. AI helps structure this data for quality management, reimbursement, and research.\\n- Patient experience: AI tools are being deployed to improve patient interactions, such as summarizing doctor visits for stressed patients who might struggle to retain information.\\n- Access, affordability, and quality: AI can optimize medical workflows, reducing avoidable medical injuries and improving treatment quality.\\n- Cures for complex diseases: AI is already making strides in accelerating diagnostics and treatment strategies for conditions such as atrial fibrillation and cancer.\\nAddressing healthcare challenges with AI\\nWorkforce shortages and data complexity\\nThe healthcare industry is facing a generational shortage of professionals, which poses significant challenges for patient care. Ross emphasized that AI can help bridge this gap by taking on administrative and repetitive tasks, allowing medical professionals to focus on patient interactions and complex decision-making.\\n“We have a generational shortage of healthcare professionals.”\\n“We have a generational shortage of healthcare professionals,” Ross explained. “AI has some challenges in other industries from an ethical perspective on reduction in jobs, but look, if it can do the jobs of people in healthcare, it’s a hero job.”\\nAt the same time, healthcare is one of the most data-intensive industries, with an estimated 30% of the world’s healthcare-related data. This data grows at a staggering 36% annual rate, presenting both challenges and opportunities for AI.\\n“Doctors want to have conversations with patients,” Ross said. “So what can we do to improve the patient experience by using AI tools to be explainers, so patients can ask questions of a record and have a computer answer in a sensible way, where doctors don’t have time to answer those questions.”\\nEnhancing patient experience and healthcare accessibility\\nThe stress and confusion that often accompany medical visits make it difficult for patients to absorb and retain crucial health information. AI tools can improve patient experiences by summarizing doctor visits and providing personalized explanations.\\nAdditionally, quality healthcare remains out of reach for many due to accessibility and affordability issues. AI is being used to improve workflow efficiencies, streamline diagnoses, and enhance decision-making to reduce costs and increase care quality.\\n“We still have tens of thousands of people who are injured every year in the U.S. from medical injury that’s avoidable. So there’s all sorts of things we can do to improve.” Ross noted. AI can help reduce these errors, ensure more efficient triage, and make scheduling and operational management more effective.\\nAdvancing treatments and accelerating disease detection\\nAI is accelerating disease detection and treatment breakthroughs, particularly in areas like arrhythmia detection, cancer treatment, and transplant matching.\\n“Some of the stuff that we’ve done in Mayo is, for instance, detection of arrhythmias,” Ross explained. “We’re at the point where the rhythms can be detected on a single lead ECG, meaning something that can be in an Apple watch or some other device. From that, we can both diagnose arrhythmias and treat them. So when a patient goes into arrhythmia, you can take interventions to get them back into rhythm.”\\nHe also highlighted Mayo Clinic’s work with Google on radiotherapy optimization: “We worked with Google to develop algorithms to do better radiotherapy treatment of disease, and we started with head and neck cancers.” With AI-powered radiotherapy, AI can maximize tumor targeting while minimizing damage to surrounding tissue, potentially transforming cancer treatment outcomes.\\nAI at scale: Mayo Clinic’s enterprise-wide approach\\nUnlike many healthcare institutions that focus on isolated AI projects, Mayo Clinic has developed an enterprise-wide AI strategy:\\nData consolidation: Over a decade, Mayo Clinic unified its electronic health records into a single system, creating a comprehensive, structured patient database.\\nAI factory: Hosted on Google Cloud’s Vertex AI, Mayo Clinic’s AI factory supports over 250 AI research and deployment projects, integrating models with real-time patient data.\\nCloud app factory: Ensuring AI models can be deployed efficiently within workflows, bridging the gap between innovation and clinical application.\\n“We have two jobs: One is to support technology for the world’s best hospital. The second is to innovate at Silicon Valley speed and put solutions into production.”\\n“We have two jobs,” Ross explained. “One is to support technology for the world’s best hospital. The second is to innovate at Silicon Valley speed and put solutions into production.”\\n“We need to go as fast as we can, but no faster than is safe”\\nAs AI...Omiting #797 chars\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"max_tokens\": 8192,\n  \"cache_name\": \"OpenAIApiProxy.call\"\n}"}

In other words, machines can be given access to large amounts of information, and trained to solve problems, spot patterns and make recommendations. Common examples of AI in everyday life are virtual assistants like Alexa and Siri.\\nWhat you might not know is that AI has been and is being used for a variety of healthcare applications. Here’s a look at how AI can be helpful in healthcare, and what to watch for as it evolves.\\nWhat can AI technology in healthcare do for me?\\nA report from the National Academy of Medicine identified three potential benefits of AI in healthcare: improving outcomes for both patients and clinical teams, lowering healthcare costs, and benefitting population health.\\nFrom preventive screenings to diagnosis and treatment, AI is being used throughout the continuum of care today. Here are two examples:\\nPreventive care\\nCancer screenings that use radiology, like a mammogram or lung cancer screening, can leverage AI to help produce results faster.\\nFor example, in polycystic kidney disease (PKD), researchers discovered that the size of the kidneys — specifically, an attribute known as total kidney volume — correlated with how rapidly kidney function was going to decline in the future.\\nBut assessing total kidney volume, though incredibly informative, involves analyzing dozens of kidney images, one slide after another — a laborious process that can take about 45 minutes per patient. With the innovations developed at the PKD Center at Mayo Clinic, researchers now use artificial intelligence (AI) to automate the process, generating results in a matter of seconds.\\nBradley J. Erickson, M.D., Ph.D., director of Mayo Clinic’s Radiology Informatics Lab, says that AI can complete time-consuming or mundane work for radiology professionals, like tracing tumors and structures, or measuring amounts of fat and muscle. “If a computer can do that first pass, that can help us a lot,” says Dr. Erickson.\\nRisk assessment\\nIn a Mayo Clinic cardiology study, AI successfully identified people at risk of left ventricular dysfunction, which is the medical name for a weak heart pump, even though the individuals had no noticeable symptoms. And that’s far from the only intersection of cardiology and AI.\\n“We have an AI model now that can incidentally say, ‘Hey, you’ve got a lot of coronary artery calcium, and you’re at high risk for a heart attack or a stroke in five or 10 years,’ ” says Bhavik Patel, M.D., M.B.A., the chief artificial intelligence officer at Mayo Clinic in Arizona.\\nHow can AI technology advance medicine and public health?\\nWhen it comes to supporting the overall health of a population, AI can help people manage chronic illnesses themselves — think asthma, diabetes and high blood pressure — by connecting certain people with relevant screening and therapy, and reminding them to take steps in their care, such as take medication.\\nAI also can help promote information on disease prevention online, reaching large numbers of people quickly, and even analyze text on social media to predict outbreaks. Considering the example of a widespread public health crisis, think of how these examples might have supported people during the early stages of COVID-19. For example, a study found that internet searches for terms related to COVID-19 were correlated with actual COVID-19 cases. Here, AI could have been used to predict where an outbreak would happen, and then help officials know how to best communicate and make decisions to help stop the spread.\\nHow can AI solutions assist in providing superior patient care?\\nYou might think that healthcare from a computer isn’t equal to what a human can provide. That’s true in many situations, but it isn’t always the case.\\nStudies have shown that in some situations, AI can do a more accurate job than humans. For example, AI has done a more accurate job than current pathology methods in predicting who will survive malignant mesothelioma, which is a type of cancer that impacts the internal organs. AI is used to identify colon polyps and has been shown to improve colonoscopy accuracy and diagnose colorectal cancer as accurately as skilled endoscopists can.\\nIn a study of a social media forum, most people asking healthcare questions preferred responses from an AI-powered chatbot over those from physicians, ranking the chatbot’s answers higher in quality and empathy. However, the researchers conducting this study emphasize that their results only suggest the value of such chatbots in answering patients’ questions, and recommend it be followed up with a more convincing study.\\nHow can physicians use AI and machine learning in healthcare?\\nOne of the key things that AI may be able to do to help healthcare professionals is save them time. For example:\\n- Keeping up with current advances. When physicians are actively participating in caring for people and other clinical duties, it can be challenging for them to keep pace with evolving technological advances that support care. AI can work with huge volumes of information — from medical journals to healthcare records — and highlight the most relevant pieces.\\n- Taking care of tedious work. When a healthcare professional must complete tasks like writing clinical notes or filling out forms, AI could potentially complete the task faster than traditional methods, even if revision was needed to refine the first pass AI makes.\\nDespite the potential for AI to save time for healthcare professionals, AI isn’t intended to replace humans.

A new collaboration with the Mayo Clinic brings physician team — and married couple — Chieh-Ju Chao and Chia-Chun Chiang to the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI (HAI) to learn how to bridge the gap.\\nImproving Treatment for Migraine Patients\\nAt the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, Chia-Chun Chiang splits her medical practice between treating patients who’ve suffered acute stroke and migraine sufferers who come to her to seek help with the intense headaches that can sometimes incapacitate them for weeks, months, or longer. Chiang, a specialist in headache medicine and vascular neurology, not only hopes to improve these daily realities for her patients but also wants to explore how AI may someday lead to better overall treatment through exciting new breakthroughs.\\nFor the next year, Chiang will be a visiting scholar at Stanford HAI, where she’s exploring the intersection of AI and neurology. The appointment is part of a new collaborative program between HAI and the Mayo Clinic and will give Chiang a chance to do what she’s always loved — find innovative solutions to challenging medical questions.\\nBorn in Taiwan, Chiang found her medical horizons were expanded early in her career, both by her neurosurgeon father and a series of influential mentors on two continents.\\n“My father always encouraged me to think not just about day-to-day realities in medical practice but about making research breakthroughs in medicine — about discovery,” she says. “Arthur Chiou, a professor of biophotonics at National Yang Ming University, opened a window for me to see different types of medical research. Later, I came to the University of California, San Diego, and met Professor Shu Chien in the department of bioengineering. He got me into the world of using math and physics to solve medical research problems. It was inspiring.”\\nChiang’s time at Stanford HAI will be spent on several research projects focusing on her special interest in migraine and stroke. She hopes to use AI to help doctors determine which of many preventive migraine medications might help chronic migraine sufferers — those experiencing migraine attacks more than 15 days per month — stave off debilitating attacks.\\n“Right now there’s no way to predict if a patient will respond to medication A, B, C, D, or E,” she says. “It’s a trial-and-error process, where we start with one medication and wait three months to see if it helps. This can be a long time and a long process when you’re in pain. I’m hoping to be able to apply advanced machine learning technologies to the Mayo Clinic’s established headache database to help predict good matches or to develop personalized treatment plans for patients with migraine.”\\nChiang is also collaborating with Nigam Shah, a Stanford professor of medicine and chief data scientist for Stanford Health Care, to be able to more effectively utilize all of a patient’s electronic health record data to understand which migraine patients might be at risk of stroke and cardiovascular disease.\\n“Things like clinician notes, consultations, and admission notes are written in free text, which traditionally have been hard for data scientists to access,” she says. “Dr. Shah’s lab has developed several advanced machine learning tools tailored to health care notes that can extract and use this sort of information. We hope to be able to apply these tools to databases at the Mayo Clinic and at Stanford to give us some solid research results from two different health care systems.”\\nChiang says AI is changing the field of neurology through innovations such as telemedicine and AI-assisted CT analysis, both of which benefit stroke patients, particularly those in isolated regions of the country where small hospitals may not have neurologists on staff. Continuing the introduction of relevant and user-friendly technology into health care, however, will require improved communication between those who develop AI and those who treat patients.\\n“I’m very excited about the use of AI in my field, which is why I wanted to come to HAI and contribute to this process by stimulating more discussion and work between data scientists and clinicians,” she says. “I see patients who are suffering every day in clinic. It’s crucial for us to continue imagining how AI tools can be developed to improve their quality of life.”\\nDeveloping Better Tools for Echocardiography\\nMayo Clinic cardiologist Chieh-Ju Chao was a teenager in Taiwan when the college entrance exam set him on a trajectory to medical school. Deep down, though, the 18-year-old harbored a secret ambition.\\n“I was happy to go into medicine, but I always loved physics,” he says. “It was always in the back of my mind. I love the beauty of the laws and formulas in physics and, as a kid, I dreamed of being the next Einstein or Feynman.” After medical school, Chao took postgraduate physics courses in Taiwan before becoming a postdoctoral fellow at UC San Diego, where he led a research project to build a 3D dynamic heart model. He began to see intersections between physics and medicine, particularly in the field of cardiology. “It was one of the most important periods of my life and one that really changed my career path,” he says.\\nFor the next year, Chao will have a chance to deeply explore his interdisciplinary interests, as a visiting scholar at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence.

AI helps structure this data for quality management, reimbursement, and research.\\n- Patient experience: AI tools are being deployed to improve patient interactions, such as summarizing doctor visits for stressed patients who might struggle to retain information.\\n- Access, affordability, and quality: AI can optimize medical workflows, reducing avoidable medical injuries and improving treatment quality.\\n- Cures for complex diseases: AI is already making strides in accelerating diagnostics and treatment strategies for conditions such as atrial fibrillation and cancer.\\nAddressing healthcare challenges with AI\\nWorkforce shortages and data complexity\\nThe healthcare industry is facing a generational shortage of professionals, which poses significant challenges for patient care. Ross emphasized that AI can help bridge this gap by taking on administrative and repetitive tasks, allowing medical professionals to focus on patient interactions and complex decision-making.\\n“We have a generational shortage of healthcare professionals.”\\n“We have a generational shortage of healthcare professionals,” Ross explained. “AI has some challenges in other industries from an ethical perspective on reduction in jobs, but look, if it can do the jobs of people in healthcare, it’s a hero job.”\\nAt the same time, healthcare is one of the most data-intensive industries, with an estimated 30% of the world’s healthcare-related data. This data grows at a staggering 36% annual rate, presenting both challenges and opportunities for AI.\\n“Doctors want to have conversations with patients,” Ross said. “So what can we do to improve the patient experience by using AI tools to be explainers, so patients can ask questions of a record and have a computer answer in a sensible way, where doctors don’t have time to answer those questions.”\\nEnhancing patient experience and healthcare accessibility\\nThe stress and confusion that often accompany medical visits make it difficult for patients to absorb and retain crucial health information. AI tools can improve patient experiences by summarizing doctor visits and providing personalized explanations.\\nAdditionally, quality healthcare remains out of reach for many due to accessibility and affordability issues. AI is being used to improve workflow efficiencies, streamline diagnoses, and enhance decision-making to reduce costs and increase care quality.\\n“We still have tens of thousands of people who are injured every year in the U.S. from medical injury that’s avoidable. So there’s all sorts of things we can do to improve.” Ross noted. AI can help reduce these errors, ensure more efficient triage, and make scheduling and operational management more effective.\\nAdvancing treatments and accelerating disease detection\\nAI is accelerating disease detection and treatment breakthroughs, particularly in areas like arrhythmia detection, cancer treatment, and transplant matching.\\n“Some of the stuff that we’ve done in Mayo is, for instance, detection of arrhythmias,” Ross explained. “We’re at the point where the rhythms can be detected on a single lead ECG, meaning something that can be in an Apple watch or some other device. From that, we can both diagnose arrhythmias and treat them. So when a patient goes into arrhythmia, you can take interventions to get them back into rhythm.”\\nHe also highlighted Mayo Clinic’s work with Google on radiotherapy optimization: “We worked with Google to develop algorithms to do better radiotherapy treatment of disease, and we started with head and neck cancers.” With AI-powered radiotherapy, AI can maximize tumor targeting while minimizing damage to surrounding tissue, potentially transforming cancer treatment outcomes.\\nAI at scale: Mayo Clinic’s enterprise-wide approach\\nUnlike many healthcare institutions that focus on isolated AI projects, Mayo Clinic has developed an enterprise-wide AI strategy:\\nData consolidation: Over a decade, Mayo Clinic unified its electronic health records into a single system, creating a comprehensive, structured patient database.\\nAI factory: Hosted on Google Cloud’s Vertex AI, Mayo Clinic’s AI factory supports over 250 AI research and deployment projects, integrating models with real-time patient data.\\nCloud app factory: Ensuring AI models can be deployed efficiently within workflows, bridging the gap between innovation and clinical application.\\n“We have two jobs: One is to support technology for the world’s best hospital. The second is to innovate at Silicon Valley speed and put solutions into production.”\\n“We have two jobs,” Ross explained. “One is to support technology for the world’s best hospital. The second is to innovate at Silicon Valley speed and put solutions into production.”\\n“We need to go as fast as we can, but no faster than is safe”\\nAs AI adoption grows, Ross urged the industry to focus on the five core challenges he outlined. Looking ahead, he sees a future where startups, research institutions, and cloud platforms collaborate to create transformative healthcare solutions.\\n“We need to go as fast as we can, but no faster than is safe,” he concluded, reinforcing the importance of responsible AI deployment in healthcare.\\nWith AI-driven solutions already improving diagnosis, treatment, and patient care, Mayo Clinic’s work serves as a blueprint for the future of AI in medicine.\\nWatch more sessions from ScaleUp:AI, and see scaleup.events for upda...Omiting #266 chars\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"max_tokens\": 8192,\n  \"cache_name\": \"OpenAIApiProxy.call\"\n}"}

A new collaboration with the Mayo Clinic brings physician team — and married couple — Chieh-Ju Chao and Chia-Chun Chiang to the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI (HAI) to learn how to bridge the gap.\\nImproving Treatment for Migraine Patients\\nAt the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, Chia-Chun Chiang splits her medical practice between treating patients who’ve suffered acute stroke and migraine sufferers who come to her to seek help with the intense headaches that can sometimes incapacitate them for weeks, months, or longer. Chiang, a specialist in headache medicine and vascular neurology, not only hopes to improve these daily realities for her patients but also wants to explore how AI may someday lead to better overall treatment through exciting new breakthroughs.\\nFor the next year, Chiang will be a visiting scholar at Stanford HAI, where she’s exploring the intersection of AI and neurology. The appointment is part of a new collaborative program between HAI and the Mayo Clinic and will give Chiang a chance to do what she’s always loved — find innovative solutions to challenging medical questions.\\nBorn in Taiwan, Chiang found her medical horizons were expanded early in her career, both by her neurosurgeon father and a series of influential mentors on two continents.\\n“My father always encouraged me to think not just about day-to-day realities in medical practice but about making research breakthroughs in medicine — about discovery,” she says. “Arthur Chiou, a professor of biophotonics at National Yang Ming University, opened a window for me to see different types of medical research. Later, I came to the University of California, San Diego, and met Professor Shu Chien in the department of bioengineering. He got me into the world of using math and physics to solve medical research problems. It was inspiring.”\\nChiang’s time at Stanford HAI will be spent on several research projects focusing on her special interest in migraine and stroke. She hopes to use AI to help doctors determine which of many preventive migraine medications might help chronic migraine sufferers — those experiencing migraine attacks more than 15 days per month — stave off debilitating attacks.\\n“Right now there’s no way to predict if a patient will respond to medication A, B, C, D, or E,” she says. “It’s a trial-and-error process, where we start with one medication and wait three months to see if it helps. This can be a long time and a long process when you’re in pain. I’m hoping to be able to apply advanced machine learning technologies to the Mayo Clinic’s established headache database to help predict good matches or to develop personalized treatment plans for patients with migraine.”\\nChiang is also collaborating with Nigam Shah, a Stanford professor of medicine and chief data scientist for Stanford Health Care, to be able to more effectively utilize all of a patient’s electronic health record data to understand which migraine patients might be at risk of stroke and cardiovascular disease.\\n“Things like clinician notes, consultations, and admission notes are written in free text, which traditionally have been hard for data scientists to access,” she says. “Dr. Shah’s lab has developed several advanced machine learning tools tailored to health care notes that can extract and use this sort of information. We hope to be able to apply these tools to databases at the Mayo Clinic and at Stanford to give us some solid research results from two different health care systems.”\\nChiang says AI is changing the field of neurology through innovations such as telemedicine and AI-assisted CT analysis, both of which benefit stroke patients, particularly those in isolated regions of the country where small hospitals may not have neurologists on staff. Continuing the introduction of relevant and user-friendly technology into health care, however, will require improved communication between those who develop AI and those who treat patients.\\n“I’m very excited about the use of AI in my field, which is why I wanted to come to HAI and contribute to this process by stimulating more discussion and work between data scientists and clinicians,” she says. “I see patients who are suffering every day in clinic. It’s crucial for us to continue imagining how AI tools can be developed to improve their quality of life.”\\nDeveloping Better Tools for Echocardiography\\nMayo Clinic cardiologist Chieh-Ju Chao was a teenager in Taiwan when the college entrance exam set him on a trajectory to medical school. Deep down, though, the 18-year-old harbored a secret ambition.\\n“I was happy to go into medicine, but I always loved physics,” he says. “It was always in the back of my mind. I love the beauty of the laws and formulas in physics and, as a kid, I dreamed of being the next Einstein or Feynman.” After medical school, Chao took postgraduate physics courses in Taiwan before becoming a postdoctoral fellow at UC San Diego, where he led a research project to build a 3D dynamic heart model. He began to see intersections between physics and medicine, particularly in the field of cardiology. “It was one of the most important periods of my life and one that really changed my career path,” he says.\\nFor the next year, Chao will have a chance to deeply explore his interdisciplinary interests, as a visiting scholar at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence. As part of a collaborative program between Stanford HAI and the Mayo Clinic, facilitated and guided by HAI Co-Director Fei-Fei Li, Chao will expand his current research on the potential use of AI technology to augment echocardiography, which harnesses ultrasound waves to examine the anatomy and dynamics of the heart. Chao hopes his dual background in medicine and technology will allow him to bridge the knowledge gap that often exists between health care and technology professionals and to accelerate the expansion of AI systems into clinical medicine at the Mayo Clinic and elsewhere.\\n“The usual pathway for this has always...Omiting #3357 chars\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"max_tokens\": 8192,\n  \"cache_name\": \"OpenAIApiProxy.call\"\n}"}

The exponential growth of healthcare data presents one of the most pressing challenges, with the sector generating approximately 30% of global data volume and experiencing an annual growth rate of 36% [reference:6]. This massive data volume creates substantial management challenges in terms of storage, processing, and meaningful analysis.\n\nImplementation barriers present another significant hurdle for healthcare organizations. The integration of AI systems with existing Electronic Health Record (EHR) infrastructure requires careful planning and substantial resources, as evidenced by Mayo Clinic's experience in managing over 250 AI research projects simultaneously [reference:12]. Healthcare institutions must also contend with the need for continuous monitoring and validation of AI outputs to prevent potential errors in clinical documentation and decision-making.\n\nWorkforce considerations represent a critical challenge in AI implementation. The current healthcare workforce shortage impacts organizations' capacity to effectively implement and manage AI systems [reference:15]. Healthcare professionals require extensive training to utilize AI tools effectively, while new roles and expertise are needed for system management and oversight. This creates a dual challenge of upskilling existing staff while recruiting specialists with AI-specific expertise.\n\nTechnical limitations also pose significant challenges. Current AI systems sometimes struggle with accurately understanding user intent and context in clinical settings [reference:6]. The complexity of medical decision-making often requires nuanced judgment that AI systems may not fully replicate. Additionally, ensuring system reliability and managing downtime risks remains crucial, particularly in critical care settings where continuous operation is essential.\n\nThese challenges are interconnected and require comprehensive solutions that address technical, organizational, and human factors simultaneously. Healthcare institutions must develop robust implementation frameworks, comprehensive training programs, and clear risk management strategies while maintaining their primary focus on patient care quality and safety.\n\n</article>"}}], "add_time": "2025-03-14_16:12:29", "hint": "{\n  \"model\": \"claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022\",\n  \"messages\": [\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"\\nThe collaborative report-writing requirement to be completed:  \\n**Write a simple report on the impact of artificial intelligence on healthcare, focusing on diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient outcomes.**  \\n\\nIt has been decomposed into several parts (writing tasks), as shown below.

Lila was no ordinary fairy; she had wings that shimmered like rainbows and a heart as kind as a summer breeze.\n\nOne sunny morning, as Lila fluttered through the forest, she stumbled upon a peculiar sight. A little squirrel named Nutty was frantically searching for something beneath the towering oak trees. His bushy tail twitched with worry, and his tiny paws dug furiously into the earth.\n\n\"Why, Nutty, whatever is the matter?\" Lila asked, her voice as gentle as a lullaby.\n\n\"Oh, Lila!\" Nutty squeaked, his eyes wide with distress. \"I've lost my acorn! The one with the golden hue! It's the most special acorn in all the forest, and I can't find it anywhere!\"\n\nLila's heart fluttered with sympathy. \"Fear not, dear Nutty. We shall find your golden acorn together.\"\n\nWith a sprinkle of fairy dust, Lila and Nutty embarked on their quest. They searched high and low, through the emerald glades and beneath the mossy stones. As they ventured deeper into the forest, they encountered a wise old owl perched on a gnarled branch.\n\n\"Whoo, whoo, what brings you here, little ones?\" the owl hooted, his eyes twinkling with ancient wisdom.\n\n\"We're searching for Nutty's golden acorn,\" Lila explained. \"Have you seen it, wise owl?\"\n\nThe owl pondered for a moment, then nodded. \"Ah, the golden acorn. It rolled away to the Meadow of Dreams, where the flowers dance and the sun never sets.\"\n\nThanking the owl, Lila and Nutty hurried to the Meadow of Dreams. The meadow was a kaleidoscope of colors, with blossoms swaying to an invisible melody. In the center, they spotted the golden acorn, glistening like a tiny sunbeam.\n\nNutty scampered forward, his heart leaping with joy. \"Oh, thank you, Lila! Thank you for helping me find my precious acorn!\"\n\nLila smiled, her wings casting a rainbow glow over the meadow. \"Remember, Nutty, sometimes the things we cherish most are found when we least expect them.\"\n\nAs the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky with hues of pink and gold, Lila and Nutty returned to the heart of the Enchanted Forest. The trees whispered their approval, and the rivers sang a song of friendship and gratitude.\n\nAnd so, in the magical embrace of the forest, Lila and Nutty learned that true friendship is the greatest treasure of all.\n\nAnd they lived happily ever after, in a world where dreams and reality danced hand in hand, forevermore.

A high-level plan tailored to the user's novel-writing needs is already in place, and your task is to further recursively plan the specified writing sub-tasks within this framework. Through your planning, the resulting novel will strictly adhere to user requirements and achieve perfection in terms of plot, creativity (ideas, themes, and topics), and development.\\n\\n1. Continue the recursive planning for the specified professional novel-writing sub-tasks. According to narrative theory, the organization of story writing and the result of the design tasks, break the tasks down into more granular writing sub-tasks, specifying their scope and specific writing content.  \\n2. Plan design sub-tasks as needed to assist and support specific writing. Design sub-tasks can include designing core conflicts, character settings, outlines and detailed outlines, key story beats, story backgrounds, plot elements, etc., to support the actual writing.  \\n3. For each task, plan a sub-task DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), where the edges represent dependency relationships between design tasks within the same layer of the DAG. Recursively plan each sub-task until all sub-tasks are atomic tasks.\\n\\n# Task Types\\n## Writing (Core, actual writing)\\n- **Function**: Perform actual novel-writing tasks in sequence according to the plan. Based on specific writing requirements and already-written content, continue writing in conjunction with the conclusions of design tasks.  \\n- **All writing tasks are continuation tasks**: Ensure continuity with the preceding content during planning. Writing tasks should flow smoothly and seamlessly with one another.  \\n- **Breakable tasks**: Writing, Design  \\n- Unless necessary, each writing sub-task should be > 500 words.\\n\\n## Design\\n- **Function**: Analyze and design any novel-writing needs other than actual writing. This includes but is not limited to designing core conflicts, character settings, outlines and detailed outlines, key story beats, story backgrounds, plot elements, etc., to support the actual writing.  \\n- **Breakable tasks**: Design  \\n\\n# Information Provided to You\\n- **`Already-written novel content`**: Content from previous writing tasks that has already been written.  \\n- **`Overall plan`**: The overall writing plan, which specifies the task you need to plan through the `is_current_to_plan_task` key.  \\n- **`Results of design tasks completed in higher-level tasks`**  \\n- **`Results of design tasks dependent on the same-layer DAG tasks`**  \\n- **`Writing tasks that require further planning`**  \\n- **`Reference planning`**: A planning sample is provided, which you may cautiously reference.  \\n\\n# Planning Tips\\n1. The last sub-task derived from a writing task must always be a writing task.  \\n2. Reasonably control the number of sub-tasks in each layer of the DAG, generally 3–5 sub-tasks. If the number of tasks exceeds this, aim to plan recursively.  \\n3. **Design tasks** can serve as **sub-tasks of writing tasks**, and as many design sub-tasks as possible should be generated to enhance the quality of writing.  \\n4. Use `dependency` to list the IDs of design tasks within the same-layer DAG. List all potential dependencies as comprehensively as possible.  \\n5. When a design sub-task involves designing specific writing structures (e.g., plot design), subsequent dependent writing tasks should not be laid out flat but should await recursive planning in subsequent rounds.  \\n6. **Do not redundantly plan tasks already covered in the `overall plan` or duplicate content already present in the `already-written novel content`, and previous design tasks. ** \\n7. Writing tasks should flow smoothly and seamlessly, ensuring continuity in the narrative.\\n8. Following the Results of design tasks\\n\\n# Task Attributes\\n1. **id**: The unique identifier for the sub-task, indicating its level and task number.  \\n2. **goal**: A precise and complete description of the sub-task goal in string format.  \\n3. **dependency**: A list of design task IDs from the same-layer DAG that this task depends on. List all potential dependencies as comprehensively as possible. If there are no dependent sub-tasks, this should be empty.  \\n4. **task_type**: A string indicating the type of task. Writing tasks are labeled as `write`, and design tasks are labeled as `think`.  \\n5. **length**: For writing tasks, this attribute specifies the scope, it is required for writing task. Design tasks do not require this attribute.  \\n6. **sub_tasks**: A JSON list representing the sub-task DAG. Each element in the list is a JSON object representing a task.\\n\\n\\n# Example\\n\\n<example index=1>\\nUser-given writing task:\\n{\\n    \\\"id\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n    \\\"task_type\\\": \\\"write\\\",\\n    \\\"goal\\\": \\\"Create an excellent suspense story set in the colony on Europa (Jupiter’s moon), incorporating the real environmental characteristics of Europa.

The setting should be enchanting and captivating, providing a backdrop that complements the plot and character development.\n\n**Location: Whispering Woods**\n\n- **Geography:** The Whispering Woods is a vast, enchanted forest filled with towering ancient trees whose leaves shimmer with a silvery hue. The forest is divided into different regions, each with its own unique characteristics. There's the Glimmering Glade, where sunlight filters through the leaves, creating a mosaic of light on the forest floor. The Enchanted River winds through the woods, its waters sparkling with a magical glow. The Forgotten Grove is a mysterious part of the forest, cloaked in mist and shadow, where Lila discovers the hidden path.\n\n- **Flora and Fauna:** The forest is home to a variety of magical creatures, including talking animals, sprites, and fairies. The flora is equally magical, with flowers that change colors with the seasons and trees that hum gentle melodies. The Heart's Bloom, a rare and powerful flower, grows only at the top of the tallest mountain, surrounded by protective enchantments.\n\n**Time Period: Timeless Fantasy**\n\n- The story is set in a timeless fantasy period, where the concept of time is fluid. This allows for a blend of ancient magic and whimsical elements without being tied to a specific historical era. The timeless setting enhances the fairy tale atmosphere, making the story accessible and relatable to children of all ages.\n\n**Magical Elements:**\n\n- **Enchanted Lantern:** Lila's lantern, which detects magic, is a key magical item. It glows brighter in the presence of strong magic and can reveal hidden paths and secrets within the forest.\n\n- **The Enchantment:** The dark enchantment cast by Morgana affects the Whispering Woods, causing parts of the forest to wither and lose their magic. This enchantment is a central element of the conflict, driving Lila's quest.\n\n- **Heart's Bloom:** This magical flower has the power to lift the enchantment and restore the forest. Its petals are said to contain the essence of pure joy and hope.\n\n- **Oliver's Feathers:** Oliver the owl's feathers have protective properties, creating a shield against dark magic.\n\n- **Flick's Pixie Dust:** Flick's pixie dust allows for temporary flight and can create illusions, adding an element of playfulness and wonder to the story.\n\nThe setting of Whispering Woods, with its timeless fantasy atmosphere and rich magical elements, provides a perfect backdrop for Lila's adventure.

The trees here were taller, their branches weaving a canopy that whispered secrets of forgotten times. Suddenly, a soft hoot echoed through the air, and from the shadows emerged Oliver, the wise old owl. His feathers glistened like moonlit snow, and his eyes, deep as the night sky, held a knowing glint.\n\n\"Ah, young Lila,\" Oliver greeted, his voice a gentle rumble. \"What brings you to this forsaken grove, where shadows dance and secrets sleep?\"\n\nLila, her heart a flutter of excitement and trepidation, replied, \"I seek the mysteries hidden within, Oliver. The forest calls to me, and I must answer.\"\n\nOliver nodded, his expression grave yet understanding. \"Beware, for this path is shrouded in a dark enchantment cast by Morgana, the sorrowful sorceress. Her magic has twisted the heart of the woods, and only the Heart's Bloom can lift the spell.\"\n\nJust then, a burst of laughter tinkled through the air like wind chimes, and Flick, the playful sprite, appeared in a swirl of pixie dust. \"Oh, Lila!

They faced many challenges: mischievous sprites that led them astray, thorny vines that reached out like greedy fingers, and shadows that whispered doubts into their ears.\n\nYet, Lila's courage never wavered. Her enchanted lantern glowed brighter with each step, revealing hidden paths and guiding them through the darkest of woods. Together, they forged ahead, their hearts united by a shared purpose and the unyielding magic of friendship.\n\nAs they journeyed deeper into the heart of the forest, the air grew colder, and the trees loomed like silent sentinels. But Lila, Oliver, and Flick pressed on, determined to find the Heart's Bloom and restore the Whispering Woods to its former glory. Little did they know, Morgana watched from afar, her heart torn between sorrow and hope, as the fate of the forest hung in the balance.  \n</article>", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "add_time": "2025-03-14_16:52:29", "hint": "{\n  \"model\": \"gpt-4o\",\n  \"messages\": [\n    {\n      \"role\": \"system\",\n      \"content\": \"You are a professional and innovative writer collaborating with other writers to create a user-requested novel.  \\n\\n### Requirements:\\n- Start from the previous ending of the story, matching the existing text's writing style, vocabulary, and overall atmosphere.

Writing tasks involve the actual creation of specific portions of text, while design tasks may involve designing core conflicts, character settings, outlines and detailed outlines, key story beats, story backgrounds, plot elements, etc., to support the actual writing.\\n\\n# Goal Updating Tips\\n- Based on the overall plan, the already-written novel, and existing design conclusions, update or revise the current writing task requirements as needed to make them more aligned with demands, reasonable, and detailed. For example, provide more detailed requirements based on design conclusions, or remove redundant content in the already-written novel.\\n- Directly output the updated goal. If no updates are needed, output the original goal.\\n\\n# Atomic Task Determination Rules\\nIndependently determine, in order, whether the following two types of sub-tasks need to be broken down:\\n\\n1. **design Sub-task**: If the writing requires certain design designs for support, and these design requirements are not provided by the **dependent design tasks** or the **already completed novel content**, then an design sub-task needs to be planned.\\n\\n2. **Writing Sub-task**: If the task involves a short piece of writing (e.g., 500 words or less) and does not contain complex twists, there is no need to further plan additional writing sub-tasks.\\n\\nIf either an design sub-task or a writing sub-task needs to be created, the task is considered a complex task.\\n\\n\\n# Output Format\\n1. First, think through the goal update in `<think></think>`. Then, based on the atomic task determination rules, evaluate in-depth and comprehensively whether design and writing sub-tasks need to be broken down. This determines whether the task is an atomic task or a complex task.\\n\\n2. Then, output the results in `<result></result>`. In `<goal_updating></goal_updating>`, directly output the updated goal; if no updates are needed, output the original goal. In `<atomic_task_determination></atomic_task_determination>`, output whether the task is an atomic task or a complex task.\\n\\nThe specific format is as follows:\\n<think>\\nThink about the goal update; then think deeply and comprehensively in accordance with the atomic task determination rules.\\n</think>\\n<result>\\n<goal_updating>\\n[Updated goal]\\n</goal_updating>\\n<atomic_task_determination>\\natomic/complex\\n</atomic_task_determination>\\n</result>\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"already-written novel:\\n```\\n\\n\\nIn the heart of the Whispering Woods, where the trees sang soft lullabies and the moonlight danced upon the leaves, lived a fairy named Lila. Her wings shimmered like dew-kissed petals, and her eyes sparkled with the curiosity of a thousand stars. The forest was her playground, a realm of endless wonders and whispered secrets, where every rustling leaf and babbling brook held tales of old.\\n\\nLila adored exploring every nook and cranny of her enchanted home, guided by the gentle glow of her enchanted lantern. This magical light could unveil hidden paths and detect the faintest traces of magic, a gift from the forest itself. One day, as the sun began its descent, painting the sky in hues of amber and rose, Lila stumbled upon a path she had never seen before. It was veiled in mist and mystery, leading to a part of the forest long forgotten by time.\\n\\nWhispers of caution echoed in her mind, tales of enchantments and shadows that lingered beyond the known. Yet, Lila's heart, as bold as it was kind, could not resist the call of the unknown. With a flutter of her wings and a determined glint in her eye, she stepped onto the path, unaware of the adventure that awaited her—a journey that would test her courage and change the fate of the Whispering Woods forever.\\n\\nThus began Lila's tale, a story of bravery, friendship, and the magic that binds us all.\\n\\nAs Lila ventured deeper into the misty path, the air grew thick with enchantment, each step resonating with an ancient magic that hummed beneath her feet. The trees here were taller, their branches weaving a canopy that whispered secrets of forgotten times. Suddenly, a soft hoot echoed through the air, and from the shadows emerged Oliver, the wise old owl. His feathers glistened like moonlit snow, and his eyes, deep as the night sky, held a knowing glint.\\n\\n\\\"Ah, young Lila,\\\" Oliver greeted, his voice a gentle rumble. \\\"What brings you to this forsaken grove, where shadows dance and secrets sleep?\\\"\\n\\nLila, her heart a flutter of excitement and trepidation, replied, \\\"I seek the mysteries hidden within, Oliver. The forest calls to me, and I must answer.\\\"\\n\\nOliver nodded, his expression grave yet understanding. \\\"Beware, for this path is shrouded in a dark enchantment cast by Morgana, the sorrowful sorceress. Her magic has twisted the heart of the woods, and only the Heart's Bloom can lift the spell.\\\"\\n\\nJust then, a burst of laughter tinkled through the air like wind chimes, and Flick, the playful sprite, appeared in a swirl of pixie dust. \\\"Oh, Lila! Adventure awaits, and I'm here to help!\\\" Flick exclaimed, his eyes twinkling with mischief.\\n\\n\\\"Together, we shall find the Heart's Bloom,\\\" Lila declared, her voice steady with resolve. \\\"For the sake of Whispering Woods, we must break Morgana's spell.\\\"\\n\\nOliver spread his wings, casting a protective shield over them with his feathers. \\\"Then let us begin our quest,\\\" he said, \\\"for time is of the essence, and the forest's heart grows weaker with each passing moment.\\\"\\n\\nWith Oliver's wisdom guiding them and Flick's pixie dust lighting their way, the trio embarked on their journey, weaving through the enchanted forest. They faced many challenges: mischievous sprites that led them astray, thorny vines that reached out like greedy fingers, and shadows that whispered doubts into their ears.\\n\\nYet, Lila's courage never wavered. Her enchanted lantern glowed brighter with each step, revealing hidden paths and guiding them through the darkest of woods. Together, they forged ahead, their hearts united by a shared purpose and the unyielding magic of friendship.\\n\\nAs they journeyed deeper into the heart of the forest, the air grew colder, and the trees loomed like silent sentinels. But Lila, Oliver, and Flick pressed on, determined to find the Heart's Bloom and restore the Whispering Woods to its former glory. Little did they know, Morgana watched from afar, her heart torn between sorrow and hope, as the fate of the forest hung in the balance.\\n```\\n\\noverall plan\\n```\\n{'id': '', 'task_type': 'write', 'goal': 'Write a fairy story for childs.

Designing a magical world or environment will enhance the story's charm and captivate young readers.\n   - **Theme and Moral**: Fairy tales often convey a moral or lesson. Identifying the theme or message of the story will guide the narrative and provide depth.\n\n2. **Writing Sub-tasks**:\n   - **Introduction**: Introduce the main characters and setting, establishing the tone and context of the story.\n   - **Development**: Develop the plot by introducing the conflict or challenge the characters face.\n   - **Climax and Resolution**: Build up to the climax where the conflict reaches its peak, followed by a resolution that ties up the story and reinforces the theme or moral.\n\nBy breaking down the task into these design and writing sub-tasks, we can ensure a well-structured and engaging fairy story that meets the goal of being around 1000 words. The design tasks will provide the necessary foundation for the writing tasks, ensuring coherence and creativity in the narrative.\n</think>\n\n<result>\n{\n    \"id\": \"\",\n    \"task_type\": \"write\",\n    \"goal\": \"Write a fairy story for child.

A high-level plan tailored to the user's novel-writing needs is already in place, and your task is to further recursively plan the specified writing sub-tasks within this framework. Through your planning, the resulting novel will strictly adhere to user requirements and achieve perfection in terms of plot, creativity (ideas, themes, and topics), and development.\\n\\n1. Continue the recursive planning for the specified professional novel-writing sub-tasks. According to narrative theory, the organization of story writing and the result of the design tasks, break the tasks down into more granular writing sub-tasks, specifying their scope and specific writing content.  \\n2. Plan design sub-tasks as needed to assist and support specific writing. Design sub-tasks can include designing core conflicts, character settings, outlines and detailed outlines, key story beats, story backgrounds, plot elements, etc., to support the actual writing.  \\n3. For each task, plan a sub-task DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), where the edges represent dependency relationships between design tasks within the same layer of the DAG. Recursively plan each sub-task until all sub-tasks are atomic tasks.\\n\\n# Task Types\\n## Writing (Core, actual writing)\\n- **Function**: Perform actual novel-writing tasks in sequence according to the plan. Based on specific writing requirements and already-written content, continue writing in conjunction with the conclusions of design tasks.  \\n- **All writing tasks are continuation tasks**: Ensure continuity with the preceding content during planning. Writing tasks should flow smoothly and seamlessly with one another.  \\n- **Breakable tasks**: Writing, Design  \\n- Unless necessary, each writing sub-task should be > 500 words.\\n\\n## Design\\n- **Function**: Analyze and design any novel-writing needs other than actual writing. This includes but is not limited to designing core conflicts, character settings, outlines and detailed outlines, key story beats, story backgrounds, plot elements, etc., to support the actual writing.  \\n- **Breakable tasks**: Design  \\n\\n# Information Provided to You\\n- **`Already-written novel content`**: Content from previous writing tasks that has already been written.  \\n- **`Overall plan`**: The overall writing plan, which specifies the task you need to plan through the `is_current_to_plan_task` key.  \\n- **`Results of design tasks completed in higher-level tasks`**  \\n- **`Results of design tasks dependent on the same-layer DAG tasks`**  \\n- **`Writing tasks that require further planning`**  \\n- **`Reference planning`**: A planning sample is provided, which you may cautiously reference.  \\n\\n# Planning Tips\\n1. The last sub-task derived from a writing task must always be a writing task.  \\n2. Reasonably control the number of sub-tasks in each layer of the DAG, generally 3–5 sub-tasks. If the number of tasks exceeds this, aim to plan recursively.  \\n3. **Design tasks** can serve as **sub-tasks of writing tasks**, and as many design sub-tasks as possible should be generated to enhance the quality of writing.  \\n4. Use `dependency` to list the IDs of design tasks within the same-layer DAG. List all potential dependencies as comprehensively as possible.  \\n5. When a design sub-task involves designing specific writing structures (e.g., plot design), subsequent dependent writing tasks should not be laid out flat but should await recursive planning in subsequent rounds.  \\n6. **Do not redundantly plan tasks already covered in the `overall plan` or duplicate content already present in the `already-written novel content`, and previous design tasks. ** \\n7. Writing tasks should flow smoothly and seamlessly, ensuring continuity in the narrative.\\n8. Following the Results of design tasks\\n\\n# Task Attributes\\n1. **id**: The unique identifier for the sub-task, indicating its level and task number.  \\n2. **goal**: A precise and complete description of the sub-task goal in string format.  \\n3. **dependency**: A list of design task IDs from the same-layer DAG that this task depends on. List all potential dependencies as comprehensively as possible. If there are no dependent sub-tasks, this should be empty.  \\n4. **task_type**: A string indicating the type of task. Writing tasks are labeled as `write`, and design tasks are labeled as `think`.  \\n5. **length**: For writing tasks, this attribute specifies the scope, it is required for writing task. Design tasks do not require this attribute.  \\n6. **sub_tasks**: A JSON list representing the sub-task DAG. Each element in the list is a JSON object representing a task.\\n\\n\\n# Example\\n\\n<example index=1>\\nUser-given writing task:\\n{\\n    \\\"id\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n    \\\"task_type\\\": \\\"write\\\",\\n    \\\"goal\\\": \\\"Create an excellent suspense story set in the colony on Europa (Jupiter’s moon), incorporating the real environmental characteristics of Europa.

It should be depicted as a lush, vibrant forest filled with magical flora and fauna. The forest is alive with colors, sounds, and mystical elements that create a sense of wonder.\n\n2. **Magical Flora and Fauna**: The forest is home to unique plants and creatures, each with their own magical properties. This includes glowing flowers, talking animals, and trees that whisper secrets. These elements not only add to the whimsy but also play a role in the plot as allies or obstacles.\n\n3. **Elder Willow's Grove**: A special part of the forest where Elder Willow resides. This area is serene and ancient, with a large, wise tree at its center. The grove is a place of wisdom and guidance, where Luna receives her vision and advice.\n\n4. **The Shadow Sorcerer's Lair**: A contrasting setting within the forest, shrouded in darkness and mystery. This area is filled with shadows and eerie creatures, reflecting the sorcerer's malevolent influence. It serves as the final battleground for the climactic battle.\n\n5. **Natural Elements**: Incorporate elements like sparkling streams, cascading waterfalls, and hidden glades that Luna and Thorn explore. These features not only enhance the magical atmosphere but also serve as settings for key events in the story.\n\n6. **Weather and Time**: The forest's weather and time of day can change to reflect the mood of the story. For example, sunny and bright during moments of hope, or dark and stormy during times of conflict.\n\nBy combining these elements, we can create a setting that is rich in detail and imagination, providing a captivating backdrop for the fairy story.

The path, once clear and inviting, now twisted and turned with an unsettling air of mystery. Thorn, ever the sprite of mischief, attempted to lighten the mood with a series of playful illusions—a parade of dancing fireflies and a chorus of frogs croaking a comical tune. Yet, even his antics could not dispel the growing sense of unease that clung to the air like a stubborn mist.\n\n\"Luna, do you feel it?\" Thorn's voice, usually buoyant and carefree, now carried a note of concern. \"The forest... it feels different.\"\n\nLuna nodded, her wings fluttering with a gentle urgency. \"Yes, Thorn. The shadows grow longer, and the whispers of the trees speak of a darkness that creeps closer with each passing moment.\"\n\nAs if in response to her words, a sudden chill swept through the forest, rustling the leaves with a sinister whisper. The sunlight, once warm and golden, now seemed to struggle against the encroaching gloom. Luna's heart quickened, her courage unwavering but her senses alert to the danger that lurked beyond the veil of shadows.\n\n\"Stay close, Thorn,\" Luna urged, her voice a beacon of determination. \"We must find the source of this darkness before it consumes our home.\"\n\nWith renewed resolve, they pressed on, their journey leading them to a hidden glade where the air was thick with enchantment and mystery. Here, the trees stood tall and ancient, their branches entwined like the fingers of a thousand hands reaching for the sky. It was a place of power, where the forest's magic thrummed beneath the surface like a heartbeat.\n\nBut as they stepped into the glade, a figure emerged from the shadows—a creature of darkness, its form shifting and swirling like smoke. It was one of the Shadow Sorcerer's minions, a harbinger of the chaos that threatened to engulf the forest.\n\n\"Beware, Luna,\" Thorn whispered, his eyes wide with both fear and fascination. \"The Shadow Sorcerer's reach is long, and his minions are many.\"\n\nLuna stood firm, her wings unfurling with a radiant glow that pushed back the encroaching shadows. \"We will not falter, Thorn. Together, we shall face whatever challenges lie ahead and protect our enchanted home.\"\n\nWith a flick of her wrist, Luna summoned the elements of nature, the wind swirling around her like a protective cloak. Thorn, invisible to the eye, prepared his illusions, ready to confound and confuse their foe. The stage was set for the first of many battles, where courage and cunning would clash against the darkness that sought to claim the forest's heart. The enchanted forest held its breath once more, as the tale of Luna and Thorn continued to unfold.  \n</article>", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "add_time": "2025-03-14_17:04:44", "hint": "{\n  \"model\": \"gpt-4o\",\n  \"messages\": [\n    {\n      \"role\": \"system\",\n      \"content\": \"You are a professional and innovative writer collaborating with other writers to create a user-requested novel.  \\n\\n### Requirements:\\n- Start from the previous ending of the story, matching the existing text's writing style, vocabulary, and overall atmosphere.

The design tasks have already provided the necessary support, such as character abilities and plot outline, so no additional design sub-tasks are needed.

For example, provide more detailed requirements based on design conclusions, or remove redundant content in the already-written novel.\\n\\n2. **Atomic Writing Task Determination**: Within the context of the overall plan and the already-written novel, evaluate whether the given writing task is an atomic task, meaning it does not require further planning. According to narrative theory and the organization of story writing, a writing task can be further broken down into more granular writing sub-tasks and design sub-tasks.

The adventure had begun, and with it, the promise of friendship and the triumph of light over shadow. The enchanted forest held its breath, waiting for the tale to unfold.\\n\\nAs Luna and Thorn ventured deeper into the heart of the forest, the vibrant hues of the flora seemed to dim, and the once cheerful melodies of the birds turned into a haunting lullaby. The path, once clear and inviting, now twisted and turned with an unsettling air of mystery. Thorn, ever the sprite of mischief, attempted to lighten the mood with a series of playful illusions—a parade of dancing fireflies and a chorus of frogs croaking a comical tune. Yet, even his antics could not dispel the growing sense of unease that clung to the air like a stubborn mist.\\n\\n\\\"Luna, do you feel it?\\\" Thorn's voice, usually buoyant and carefree, now carried a note of concern. \\\"The forest... it feels different.\\\"\\n\\nLuna nodded, her wings fluttering with a gentle urgency. \\\"Yes, Thorn. The shadows grow longer, and the whispers of the trees speak of a darkness that creeps closer with each passing moment.\\\"\\n\\nAs if in response to her words, a sudden chill swept through the forest, rustling the leaves with a sinister whisper. The sunlight, once warm and golden, now seemed to struggle against the encroaching gloom. Luna's heart quickened, her courage unwavering but her senses alert to the danger that lurked beyond the veil of shadows.\\n\\n\\\"Stay close, Thorn,\\\" Luna urged, her voice a beacon of determination. \\\"We must find the source of this darkness before it consumes our home.\\\"\\n\\nWith renewed resolve, they pressed on, their journey leading them to a hidden glade where the air was thick with enchantment and mystery. Here, the trees stood tall and ancient, their branches entwined like the fingers of a thousand hands reaching for the sky. It was a place of power, where the forest's magic thrummed beneath the surface like a heartbeat.\\n\\nBut as they stepped into the glade, a figure emerged from the shadows—a creature of darkness, its form shifting and swirling like smoke. It was one of the Shadow Sorcerer's minions, a harbinger of the chaos that threatened to engulf the forest.\\n\\n\\\"Beware, Luna,\\\" Thorn whispered, his eyes wide with both fear and fascination. \\\"The Shadow Sorcerer's reach is long, and his minions are many.\\\"\\n\\nLuna stood firm, her wings unfurling with a radiant glow that pushed back the encroaching shadows. \\\"We will not falter, Thorn. Together, we shall face whatever challenges lie ahead and protect our enchanted home.\\\"\\n\\nWith a flick of her wrist, Luna summoned the elements of nature, the wind swirling around her like a protective cloak. Thorn, invisible to the eye, prepared his illusions, ready to confound and confuse their foe. The stage was set for the first of many battles, where courage and cunning would clash against the darkness that sought to claim the forest's heart. The enchanted forest held its breath once more, as the tale of Luna and Thorn continued to unfold.\\n```\\n\\noverall plan\\n```\\n{'id': '', 'task_type': 'write', 'goal': 'Write a fairy story for child.

Her wings shimmered like the morning dew, and her laughter was a melody that wove through the trees, inviting every creature to join her in harmony. Luna's heart was as boundless as the sky, filled with kindness and courage, and her gift of communicating with animals made her beloved among the forest's denizens.\\n\\nOne bright morning, as the forest awoke to the symphony of chirping birds and rustling leaves, Luna fluttered through the grove, her eyes sparkling with the promise of adventure. She paused by the gentle stream, where Elder Willow, the wise tree spirit, stood rooted in timeless wisdom. \\\"Luna,\\\" the elder's voice resonated like the rustle of leaves, \\\"a shadow looms over our forest. The Shadow Sorcerer stirs, and only you can dispel his darkness.\\\"\\n\\nAs Luna absorbed the gravity of Elder Willow's words, a mischievous giggle echoed from the branches above. Thorn, the sprite with a twinkle in his eye and mischief in his heart, appeared, hanging upside down from a low-hanging branch. \\\"A quest, you say? Count me in!\\\" he chimed, his voice a playful breeze. With the ability to vanish into thin air and conjure illusions, Thorn was a trickster with a heart of gold, always ready for a new escapade.\\n\\nTogether, Luna and Thorn set forth, their path winding through the vibrant forest, where flowers glowed with an inner light and creatures of every hue and shape watched with curious eyes. The adventure had begun, and with it, the promise of friendship and the triumph of light over shadow. The enchanted forest held its breath, waiting for the tale to unfold.\\n\\nAs Luna and Thorn ventured deeper into the heart of the forest, the vibrant hues of the flora seemed to dim, and the once cheerful melodies of the birds turned into a haunting lullaby. The path, once clear and inviting, now twisted and turned with an unsettling air of mystery. Thorn, ever the sprite of mischief, attempted to lighten the mood with a series of playful illusions—a parade of dancing fireflies and a chorus of frogs croaking a comical tune. Yet, even his antics could not dispel the growing sense of unease that clung to the air like a stubborn mist.\\n\\n\\\"Luna, do you feel it?\\\" Thorn's voice, usually buoyant and carefree, now carried a note of concern. \\\"The forest... it feels different.\\\"\\n\\nLuna nodded, her wings fluttering with a gentle urgency. \\\"Yes, Thorn. The shadows grow longer, and the whispers of the trees speak of a darkness that creeps closer with each passing moment.\\\"\\n\\nAs if in response to her words, a sudden chill swept through the forest, rustling the leaves with a sinister whisper. The sunlight, once warm and golden, now seemed to struggle against the encroaching gloom. Luna's heart quickened, her courage unwavering but her senses alert to the danger that lurked beyond the veil of shadows.\\n\\n\\\"Stay close, Thorn,\\\" Luna urged, her voice a beacon of determination. \\\"We must find the source of this darkness before it consumes our home.\\\"\\n\\nWith renewed resolve, they pressed on, their journey leading them to a hidden glade where the air was thick with enchantment and mystery.

A high-level plan tailored to the user's knowledge problem-solving needs is already in place, and your task is to further recursively plan the specified writing sub-tasks within this framework. Through your planning, the resulting report will strictly adhere to user requirements and achieve perfection in terms of analysis, logic, and content depth.\\n\\n1. Continue the recursive planning for the specified professional report-writing sub-tasks. According to research and analysis theories, break down the organization of report writing and the results of analysis tasks into more granular writing sub-tasks, specifying their scope and specific writing content.\\n2. Plan analysis sub-tasks and search sub-tasks as needed to assist and support specific writing. Analysis sub-tasks can include tasks such as designing outlines, detailed outlines, data analysis, information organization, logic structure building, and key argument determination to support actual writing. Search sub-tasks are responsible for gathering necessary information and data from internet.\\n3. For each task, plan a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of sub-tasks, where the edges represent dependency relationships between search and analysis tasks within the same layer of the DAG. Recursively plan each sub-task until all sub-tasks become atomic tasks.\\n\\n# Task Types\\n## Writing (Core, Actual Writing)\\n- **Function**: Perform actual report-writing tasks in sequence according to the plan. Based on specific writing requirements and already written content, continue writing in conjunction with the conclusions of analysis tasks and search tasks.\\n- **All writing tasks are continuation tasks**: Ensure continuity and logical consistency with the preceding content during planning. Writing tasks should flow smoothly and seamlessly with one another, maintaining the overall coherence and unity of the report.\\n- **Breakable tasks**: Writing, Analysis, Search\\n- Unless necessary, each writing sub-task should be > 500 words.\\n\\n## Analysis  \\n- **Function**: Analyze and design any requirements outside of actual report writing. This includes but is not limited to research plan design, designing outlines, detailed outlines, data analysis, information organization, logic structure building, key argument determination, etc., to support actual writing.\\n- **Breakable tasks**: Analysis, Search\\n\\n## Search  \\n- **Function**: Perform information-gathering tasks, including collecting necessary data, materials, and information from internet to support analysis and writing tasks.\\n- **Breakable tasks**: Search\\n\\n# Planning Tips  \\n1. The last sub-task derived from a writing task must always be a writing task.  \\n2. Reasonably control the number of sub-tasks in each layer of the DAG, **generally 3–5 sub-tasks**. If the number of tasks exceeds this range, aim to plan recursively. **Do not planning over 8 sub-tasks in one layer.**\\n3. **Analysis tasks** and **search tasks** can serve as **sub-tasks of writing tasks**, more analysis sub-tasks and search sub-tasks should be generated to enhance the quality of writing.  \\n4. Use `dependency` to list the IDs of analysis tasks and search tasks within the same-layer DAG. List all potential dependencies as comprehensively as possible.\\n5. **When an analysis sub-task involves designing specific writing structures, subsequent dependent writing tasks should not be flatten, it should be recursived. e.g., write xxx acorrding to the structure.**. Never forget it.\\n6. **Do not redundantly plan tasks already covered in the `overall plan` or duplicate content already present in the `already written report content`, and previous analysis tasks.**  \\n7. Follow the results of analysis tasks and search tasks.\\n8. search tasks goal only specify the information requirements, do not specify the source or specify how to search.\\n**9**. Unless specified by user, the length of each writing task should be > 500 words.\\n\\n# Task Attributes (Required)  \\n1. **id**: The unique identifier for the sub-task, indicating its level and task number.  \\n2. **goal**: A precise and complete description of the sub-task goal in string format.  \\n3. **dependency**: A list of IDs of search and analysis tasks tasks within the same-layer DAG that this task depends on. List all potential dependencies as comprehensively as possible. If there are no dependent sub-tasks, this should be empty.  \\n4. **task_type**: A string indicating the type of task. Writing tasks are labeled as `write`, analysis tasks are labeled as `think`, and search tasks are labeled as `search`.  \\n5. **length**: For writing tasks, this attribute specifies the scope. It is required for writing tasks. Analysis tasks and search tasks do not require this attribute.  \\n6. **sub_tasks**: A JSON list representing the sub-task DAG. Each element in the list is a JSON object representing a task.\\n\\n# Example\\n<example index=1>\\nUser-given writing task:\\n{\\n    \\\"id\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n    \\\"task_type\\\": \\\"write\\\",\\n    \\\"goal\\\": \\\"Generate a detailed business biography to document DeepSeek's rise\\\",\\n    \\\"length\\\": \\\"8600 words\\\"\\n}\\n\\nA partially complete recursive global plan is provided as a reference, represented in a recursively nested JSON structure.

The song is intended to be a \\\"populist parody, almost the antithesis to 'Uprising',\\\" another Muse song with a similar anti-establishment theme that instead \\\"[takes] it seriously.\\\"[8]\\nMusic video\\neditThe music video for \\\"Will of the People\\\" was released on 1 June 2022 at 15:00 BST (UTC+1), the same day as the single was released. The music video for \\\"Will of the People\\\" follows on from the videos for previous singles \\\"Won't Stand Down\\\" and \\\"Compliance\\\", continuing the same themes and following the same characters.[4]\\nThe video, directed and animated by Tom Teller,[4] is set in a dystopian city in which a revolution takes place. The video opens with a person receiving a delivery of a metallic mask, the same as the mask featured in the \\\"Won't Stand Down\\\" and \\\"Compliance\\\" music videos; he is later revealed to be Will the Hacker, the leader of the revolution. As the video progresses, a growing number of revolutionaries advance through the city,[7] destroying security cameras, spraying \\\"Will of the People\\\" logo graffiti onto walls, tearing down statues and attacking the building belonging to the Ministry of Truth,[9] in reference to George Orwell's dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four.\\nAs the Ministry of Truth building explodes and continues to burn, the city's electricity supply and mobile phone signals are shut down in an attempt to smother the revolution. The leaders of the revolution depart the city in futuristic supercars,[7] resembling Tesla Cybertrucks, heading into the desert as the skyline of the city burns behind them.[7][9] In the desert the revolutionaries find three ancient statues of the faces of band members Matt Bellamy, Dominic Howard and Chris Wolstenholme carved in the style of Mount Rushmore; they are destroyed by being pulled to the ground with cables, before being covered in \\\"Will of the People\\\" logo graffiti. Three members take off their masks, revealing themselves as the members of Muse.[7][9]\\nThe music video for \\\"Will of the People\\\" references multiple forms of popular culture; as well as Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, the video has been compared to \\\"V for Vendetta set in [the] Blade Runner 2049 universe\\\".[4]\\nPersonnel\\neditCredits adapted from Tidal.[10]\\nMuse\\n- Matt Bellamy – lead vocals, guitars, composition, production, engineering\\n- Chris Wolstenholme – bass guitar, production, engineering\\n- Dominic Howard – drums, production, engineering\\nProduction\\n- Aleks Von Korff – additional production, engineering\\n- Chris Gehringer – mastering\\n- Serban Ghenea – mixing\\n- Bryce Bordone – mixing engineer\\n- Andy Maxwell – studio assistant\\n- Joe Devenney – studio assistant\\n- Tommy Bosustow – studio assistant\\n- Chris Whitemyer – technical assistant\\n- Paul Warren – technical assistant\\nCharts\\nedit| Chart (2022) | Peak position |\\n|---|---|\\n| Canada Rock (Billboard)[11] | 44 |\\n| Czech Republic Rock (IFPI)[12] | 12 |\\n| Japan Hot Overseas (Billboard)[13] | 19 |\\n| New Zealand Hot Singles (RMNZ)[14] | 25 |\\n| UK Singles Sales (OCC)[15] | 96 |\\n| UK Singles Downloads (OCC)[16] | 93 |\\n| UK Rock & Metal (OCC)[17] | 11 |\\n| US Mainstream Rock (Billboard)[18] | 23 |\\nReferences\\nedit- ^ \\\"WOTP August 26th.

The album was self-produced. It is a genre-hopping album that Matthew Bellamy described as \\\"a greatest hits album – of new songs.\\\"[2] \\\"Won't Stand Down\\\", \\\"Compliance\\\", \\\"Will of the People\\\", and \\\"Kill or Be Killed\\\" were released as singles before the album was released, and \\\"You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween\\\" was released as a single the same day the album came out.\\nThe album received generally positive reviews and became Muse's seventh consecutive number-one album in the UK.[3] A world tour in support of the album, the Will of the People World Tour, began in April 2022 and concluded in November 2023.[4][5] It was ranked as the #17 best guitar album of 2022 by Guitar World readers.[6]\\nBackground and recording\\n[edit]About the origins of the album, Matthew Bellamy related that Warner Records requested a greatest hits album from Muse, but, instead, the band decided to make an album that was a \\\"montage\\\" of \\\"all of those types of genres that we’ve touched on in the past\\\" and would feel like \\\"a greatest hits album – of new songs.\\\"[2] Warner stated that the album spans multiple genres, describing \\\"Will of the People\\\" as a \\\"glam rocker\\\" and \\\"Kill or Be Killed\\\" as \\\"industrial\\\".[7]\\nBellamy said the lyrics on the album were inspired by \\\"the increasing uncertainty and instability in the world [...] as the Western empire and the natural world, which have cradled us for so long, are genuinely threatened. This album is a personal navigation through those fears and preparation for what comes next.\\\"[8]\\nThe album was recorded at Bellamy's Red Room studio in Santa Monica, California,[9] as well as at Black Lodge and Abbey Road Studios in London.[10]\\nPromotion and release\\n[edit]The first snippet from the album was heard on 25 December 2021, when Bellamy briefly livestreamed himself and his 10-year-old son, Bing, listening to the song \\\"Won't Stand Down\\\".[11][12] About two weeks later, Muse announced the song would be released on 13 January 2022, making it their first single since \\\"Pressure\\\" in September 2018.[12] The second single from the album, \\\"Compliance\\\", was released on 17 March, alongside the announcement of the album and its release date of 26 August.[13][14]\\nThe third single from the album was the title track, which was released on 1 June 2022.[4][15] That same month, Muse began the European festival leg of their Will of the People World Tour, on which they played all three of the new singles live, as well as a then-unreleased track from the album, \\\"Kill or Be Killed\\\".[16] On 21 July, \\\"Kill or Be Killed\\\" was released as the album's fourth single.[17][18] On 23 August, Muse announced that a fifth single from the album, \\\"You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween\\\", would be released on 26 August, the same day as the release of the album.[19][20]\\nAn Italian-language version of \\\"Ghosts (How Can I Move On)\\\" featuring Elisa was released on 25 November 2022,[21] and a French-language version featuring Mylène Farmer was released two weeks later, on 9 December.[22]\\nOn 1 August 2022, it was announced that Will of the People could be purchased as a non-fungible token (NFT) on the \\\"eco-friendly\\\" Polygon-powered platform Serenade, and that it would be the first album for which NFT sales would qualify for the UK and Australian charts.[23][24] Per The Guardian: \\\"The Muse NFT album will retail for £20 and will be limited to 1,000 copies globally. As both an NFT and a limited-edition format, it is relatively sparse in its offering. Buyers will get a downloadable version of the album – complete with different sleeve – as high-res FLAC files; the members of Muse will digitally sign it and each of the 1,000 buyers will have their names permanently listed on the linked roster of purchasers.\\\"[24]\\nComposition\\n[edit]Musically, Will of the People has been described as glam rock,[25][26] alternative rock,[27] synth-pop,[25] arena rock,[25] hard rock,[28] progressive rock,[28] heavy metal,[29] progressive metal,[28] industrial metal,[26] and electropop.[26]\\nCritical reception\\n[edit]| Aggregate scores | |\\n|---|---|\\n| Source | Rating |\\n| AnyDecentMusic? | 6.5/10[30] |\\n| Metacritic | 71/100[31] |\\n| Review scores | |\\n| Source | Rating |\\n| AllMusic | [32] |\\n| Clash | 7/10[27] |\\n| Classic Rock | [33] |\\n| DIY | [34] |\\n| Gigwise | [35] |\\n| Kerrang! | 4/5[36] |\\n| MusicOMH | [37] |\\n| NME | [38] |\\n| Pitchfork | 3.7/10[39] |\\n| Sputnikmusic | 3.5/5[40] |\\nWill of the People received generally positive reviews from critics.

The song's name has been \\\"officially\\\" leaked on March 14th, 2022 via the JSON output from wontstanddown.muse.mu, which contains basic album info. In late May of 2022, Apple Music began showing the track length of the song in the album playlist, while Amazon set up a release date of June the 1st. The song itself got leaked on May 26th, 2022, while the official release date of the single, being June 1st, was announced a day later.\\nWill Of The People has previously been teased by Muse through a couple of short clips, on YouTube and Instagram, revealing the album's name. Upon the album announcement, Warner described it as a track that \\\"brings playful provocation to a dystopian glam-rocker\\\"[2]\\nAccording to Matt, the song is \\\"like a populist parody, almost the antithesis to Uprising\\\", adding \\\"Whereas ‘Uprising’ was almost populist but taking it seriously, ‘Will Of The People’ is almost, ‘Do we know that we’re stupid now? Do we know how silly this sounds and looks?’ Inside of me, there’s always been this little bit of a conflict between the desire for direct democracy and a bit more actual power to the people, but then at the same time realising that sometimes the people can be mad… Because they’ve had no voice for so long, populism ends up becoming distorted and strange and spiting everything. People end up spiting things just because they don’t have any fucking say.\\\".[3]\\nInstrumentation\\nThe track starts out with a looping crowd, chanting the line \\\"The Will of the People\\\". The same loop appears throughout the song. The track itself is based around guitar, bass and drums, with some guitar-synth layering, which is especially noticeable during the last part. The song also features heavy use of roto-toms during the bridge part. It also features a lot of \\\"ooh\\\"s and \\\"woah\\\"s throughout the song, aswel as a high-pitched scream, at around 2 minutes and 42 seconds. The choir consists of around 150 audio tracks, all of which were put together in remote, due to all the lockdowns throughout the pandemic.[4]\\nStylistically, the song is reminiscent of songs such as Uprising, Psycho and Supermassive Black Hole, featuring a similar swing-rhythm and elements of glam-rock and a punchy 50s Elvis rockabilly. The looping choir has been compared to \\\"The Beautiful People\\\" by Marilyn Manson and the songs structure has been compared to that of Green Day, sounding like 'East Jesus Nowhere'. It's also been compared to Pressure and New Kind of Kick, having the same \\\"rock'n'roll\\\" feel with the saturated vocals. The song runs in A-Major and at a tempo of 130BPM.\\nThe rough layout of the riff, which appears in the pre-chorus of the song, extends all the way back to 2019, when it was played by Matt as an improv riff after Unsustainable, during the Simulation Theory Tour.\\nWill of the People is one of three songs on the album to feature Jeff Buckley's Telecaster. It is used for the high bluesy leads during the choruses.\\nMusic Video\\nLike the song itself, the music video was also used in the teaser, following the album reveal in March of 2022. The video itself tells the story of how the heads got torn down during a riot, which can be seen on the album artwork.\\nMore here.\\nTrivia\\nFollowing the release of the music video, Muse posted the official lyrics under the YouTube video, but similar to other lyrical mistakes in the past (such as the various misprints in the Origin of Symmetry sleeve notes), the official lyrics contain two errors. As confirmed by Aleks Von Korff on Reddit, a line from the first verse is written as “Don't need a goon to flood with devotion”, when Matt sings ”Don't need a gun to flirt with devotion”[5], while a line from the second verse, written as “We’re gonna smash this nation to pieces” is in fact “your nation”.\\nThe chants/crowd vocals are not only sung by Matt Bellamy. Instead, they are sung by the entire band, together with Elle, Bing Bellamy, Chris's wife Caris and his kids, Ernie, Buster, Teddi, Tabitha and Indiana.\\nLive\\nPerformed live as an intro to the shows, it features a slightly extended guitar chugging intro. It was first performed live on June 4th, 2022.\\nMore here.\\nLyrics\\nOfficial lyrics as posted by Muse, however these lyrics do contain errors as noted above.\\nThe will of the people, the will of the people, the will of the will of\\nThe will of the people, the will of the people, the will of the will of\\nThe will of the people, the will of the people, the will of the will of\\nThe will of the people, the will of the people, the will of the will of\\nLet’s push the emperors into the ocean, Don’t need a goon to flood with devotion, With every hour our number increases We’ll smash your institutions to pieces\\nWe need a transformation One we all can see We need a revolution So long as we stay free\\nWelcome to the desecration baby We’ll build you right up then we’ll tear you down Welcome to the celebration baby The judges are jailed and the future is ours\\nFree your sons and unlock your daughters We’ll throw the baby out with the bath water With every second our anger increases We’re gonna smash this nation to pieces\\nWe need a transmutation One we all conceive We need a revolution So long as we stay free\\nWelcome to the desecration baby We’ll build you right up then we’ll tear you down Welcome to the celebration baby The judges are jailed and the future is ours\\nThe will of the people, the will of the people, the will of the will of\\nThe will of the people, the will of the people, the will of the will of\\nThe will of the people, the will of the people, the will of the will of\\nThe will of the people, the will of the people, the will of the will of\\nThe will of the people, the will of the people, the will of the will of\\nThe will of the people, the will of the people, the will of the will of\\nThe will of the people, the will of the sheeple, the will of the will of\\nThe will of the people, the will of the people, the will of the will of\\nThe will of the people, the will of the people, the will of the will of\\nWelcome to the desecration, baby We'll build up you right up and we'll tear you down Welcome to the celebration, baby The judges are jailed and the future is ours\\nReferences\\n- ↑ https://wontstanddown.muse.mu/api/v1/catalogue/new/\\n- ↑ https://themusicuniverse.com/muse-announces-will-people/\\n- ↑ https://www.nme.com/big-reads/muse-cover-interview-2022-will-of-the-people-3243209\\n- ↑ https://www.instagram.com/p/CeRBJolg96L/\\n- ↑ https://www.reddit.com/r/Muse/comments/v3wydc/are_these_the_real_lyrics_or_did_apple_music/ib2fui1/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\\n</content>\\n\\nMake your judgment and output according to the requirements, determining whether the webpage content can fulfill the purpose of this search round\\n\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"max_tokens\": 8192,\n  \"cache_name\": \"OpenAIApiProxy.call\"\n}"}

Nella sua disamina, il critico si è soffermato sulla tendenza del gruppo verso il ricalcare i propri stilemi classici, a discapito della sperimentazione che aveva caratterizzato le pubblicazioni precedenti.[24]\\nTracce\\n[modifica | modifica wikitesto]Testi e musiche di Matthew Bellamy.\\n- Will of the People – 3:18\\n- Compliance – 4:10\\n- Liberation – 3:06\\n- Won't Stand Down – 3:29\\n- Ghosts (How Can I Move On) – 3:37\\n- You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween – 3:00\\n- Kill or Be Killed – 4:59\\n- Verona – 4:57\\n- Euphoria – 3:23\\n- We Are Fucking Fucked – 3:36\\nFormazione\\n[modifica | modifica wikitesto]Hanno partecipato alle registrazioni, secondo le note di copertina:[25]\\n- Gruppo\\n- Matthew Bellamy – voce, chitarra tastiera, pianoforte, cori (traccia 1), GuitarViol (traccia 4)[26]\\n- Chris Wolstenholme – basso, cori (traccia 1)\\n- Dominic Howard – batteria, cori (traccia 1)\\n- Altri musicisti (traccia 1)\\n- Elle Bellamy – cori\\n- Bing Bellamy – cori\\n- Caris Wolstenholme – cori\\n- Ernie Wostenholme – cori\\n- Buster Wolstenholme – cori\\n- Teddi Wolstenholme – cori\\n- Tabitha Wolstenholme Tolhurst – cori\\n- Indiana Wolstenholme Tolhurst – cori\\n- Produzione\\n- Muse – produzione, ingegneria del suono, direzione artistica\\n- Aleks von Korff – produzione aggiuntiva, ingegneria del suono, missaggio al Red Room (traccia 7)\\n- Şerban Ghenea – missaggio ai MixStar Studios (eccetto tracce 4 e 7)\\n- Bryce Bordone – assistenza al missaggio ai MixStar Studios (eccetto tracce 4 e 7)\\n- Chris Gehringer – mastering al Sterling Sound\\n- Joe Devenney – assistenza tecnica al Red Room, missaggio al Red Room (traccia 7)\\n- Andy Maxwell – assistenza tecnica agli Abbey Road Studios\\n- Chris Whitemyer – assistenza tecnica\\n- Paul Warren – assistenza tecnica\\n- Dan Lancaster – missaggio al The Steam Room Studio (traccia 4)\\n- Rhys May – assistenza al missaggio al The Steam Room Studio (traccia 4)\\n- Adrian Bushby – ingegneria del suono aggiuntiva (traccia 7)\\n- Jesse Less Stout – direzione creativa, direzione artistica, copertina, grafica gatefold\\n- Tiago Marinho – copertina, grafica gatefold\\n- Tyrone Yarde – copertina, grafica gatefold\\n- Gabriella Russo – copertina, grafica gatefold\\n- Nick Fancher – fotografia\\n- Andrea \\\"Waarp\\\" Marcias – grafica retro e CD\\nClassifiche\\n[modifica | modifica wikitesto]Classifiche settimanali\\n[modifica | modifica wikitesto]| Classifica (2022) | Posizione massima |\\n|---|---|\\n| Australia[27] | 1 |\\n| Austria[27] | 1 |\\n| Belgio (Fiandre)[27] | 2 |\\n| Belgio (Vallonia)[27] | 1 |\\n| Canada[28] | 5 |\\n| Croazia[29] | 1 |\\n| Danimarca[27] | 18 |\\n| Finlandia[27] | 2 |\\n| Francia[27] | 1 |\\n| Germania[27] | 2 |\\n| Giappone[30] | 20 |\\n| Grecia[31] | 36 |\\n| Irlanda[32] | 2 |\\n| Islanda[33] | 13 |\\n| Italia[27] | 1 |\\n| Norvegia[27] | 16 |\\n| Nuova Zelanda[27] | 1 |\\n| Paesi Bassi[27] | 2 |\\n| Polonia[34] | 6 |\\n| Portogallo[27] | 1 |\\n| Regno Unito[35] | 1 |\\n| Repubblica Ceca[36] | 37 |\\n| Slovacchia[37] | 51 |\\n| Spagna[27] | 2 |\\n| Stati Uniti[28] | 15 |\\n| Svezia[27] | 27 |\\n| Svizzera[27] | 1 |\\n| Ungheria[38] | 3 |\\nNote\\n[modifica | modifica wikitesto]- ^ (EN) Neil Z.

Since a lot has happened during these years, it, thematically, explores everything from Black Lives Matter protests, to the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdowns, to the 2021 Capitol riots, and much more.\\nAccording to Muse, \\\"Will of the People was created in Los Angeles and London and is influenced by increasing uncertainty and instability in the world. A pandemic, new wars in Europe, massive protests & riots, an attempted insurrection, Western democracy wavering, rising authoritarianism, wildfires and natural disasters and the destabilisation of the global order all informed Will of the People. It has been a worrying and scary time for all of us as the Western empire and the natural world, which we have cradled us for so long are genuinely threatened. This album is a personal navigation through those fears and preparation for what comes next.\\\"[5]\\nIn an interview with Zane Lowe, upon announcing the album, on March 17th, 2022, Bellamy said about it, that the label originally planned them to release a best-of compilation of existing songs (later elaborating on that, saying that a \\\"Best-Of Album\\\" possibility is in their contract[6]). They instead decided to make a new album, which, musically, encapsulates and recaps the Muse's best work from past albums. As Bellamy said in an interview with a French radio station \\\"RTL 2\\\" in June of 2022, with the release of Origin of Muse and Origin of Symmetry's 20th Anniversary Remix, the band listened to a lot of their old music during the writing and recording process, and were thinking about certain things and ideas that they tried to do in the past, but they didn't work out. As an example, he mentioned Kill or Be Killed; Saying that \\\"2 to 3 times in our career, we've tried to create something that kind of...resembled metal or something, but we couldn't quite go there\\\".[7] As such, as mentioned by Bellamy on the Zane Lowe interview, the album goes \\\"all the way, from metal, to pop, to my first version of an Adele piano-like song, to electronica\\\", featuring songs like Kill or Be Killed, which is \\\"the best prog metal song they've ever done that could've been on Drones\\\", becoming a fan-favourite after just a few live performances, and We Are Fucking Fucked, which he sees as \\\"the weirdest, darkest lost B-side of Muse's life\\\", while also including songs like Liberation, which is, according to NME, a Queen-like ballad song and Verona, bringing \\\"purity to the nostalgic electronic textures\\\", as described by Warner themselves .[8]\\nIn the same interview, he mentioned that he let Dom Howard take the lead in terms of decisions on this album, jokingly saying that this is why the album, from start to finish, took so long, saying that Howard took time with the process. On top of that, he added that the album was self-produced by the band themselves,[9] however it was made with help and assistance from Aleks Von Korff.\\nTaking in account previous mention of Bellamy's idea of 'era blending' and 'best-of' album, Will of The People presents songs that are reminiscent of their previous albums, Will Of The People harks back to songs like Psycho and Uprising; Compliance seemingly a new feature, presents influences from the 90s with a texture from Simulation Theory; Liberation is a song that could have been released on The Resistance; Won't Stand Down, presents patterns and verses that could have been present on Origin of Symmetry with its metal influence with the strings; Ghosts (How Can I Move On), a song that could be the one that Matt described as an 'Adele type of song'; You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween, a song that could be released Simulation Theory with its 80's inspired sound ala Rockwell's Somebody's Watching Me; Kill or Be Killed, is intriguing due the mix of influences, ranging from Absolution, and Black Holes and Revelations to Drones with its metal riffs; Verona presents sounds similar the ones from The 2nd Law, like Follow Me and Madness, with its synths and U2 esque patterns and riffs; Euphoria, similar to the songs from Simulation Theory, presents synths straight out of the 70s and 80s, similar to the works of Donna Summer and Giorgio Moroder; Finally, the closer, 'We Are Fucking Fucked', presents sounds harking back to Showbiz, Origin of Symmetry and The 2nd Law with a riff similar to Knights of Cydonia.\\nBackground\\nAfter the Simulation Theory World Tour ended in 2019, Bellamy came up with the idea for the album, which, according to his interview with NME, was that they'd \\\"make it a bit more about what’s actually happening in the world right now\\\", adding \\\"what I didn’t know was what was about to happen.\\\" [10] Later, in January of 2020, Matt first publicly hinted at working on new Muse material in an interview with ALT 98.7 FM, backstage at the ALTerEGO Festival. He said that the goal for 2020 was to work on new Muse material. The plans were brought to halt due to the coronavirus pandemic, as the three were unable to get together due to the lockdowns. Bellamy instead focused on releasing his solo material. Later that year, in May, Matt further hinted on working on Muse material in an interview with Zane Lowe on Beats 1 Radio, saying that he has a few pieces written that are suited for Muse.[11] In an interview with Rolling Stone, also in May, he said that that the idea would be to record the album in 2021 and go on a tour in 2022.[12]\\nLater, in 2021, Bellamy further confirmed that work on the new Muse album has begun, in an interview with The Jaded Hearts Club Band for The Sun.[13] Bellamy said the following: \\\"I started writing when all the protests and all the chaos were kicking off. It’s a weird thing to say but it suits the music I write. It keeps you a little bit on edge.\\\" Additionally, Bellamy jokingly said, in an Instagram comment reply on Dom Howard's Instagram post, that the album would include \\\"emotional gasps and many usages of the word ‘soul’.\\\".\\nBellamy also had once got imbued with the recent label's request to release the greatest hits album of Muse's iconic songs from each eighth album they recorded, but they turned down the request and instead, they decide to produce a new album that combined with all various sounds and influences from each of their previous album into a new and fresh package with an additional comment by him as \\\"a greatest hits album - of a new songs - essentially\\\" [14] during Matt's interview with NME and the band interview with French radio talk show.\\nThe album, and its release date (August 26th, 2022) was finally announced on March 17th, 2022, together with the release of Compliance. The announcement, being six months apart from the release date, was met with mixed feelings from fans, however, since then, one more song has been released, another one performed live, and the fourth song still planned to be released before the album drops.

Il est le successeur de Simulation Theory, paru en 2018. L'album a été écrit à Los Angeles et enregistré en 2021 au studio Abbey Road à Londres, tout juste 20 ans après Origin of Symmetry, dernier album du groupe ayant été enregistré dans ce studio[2].\\nLe premier single issu de l'album, Won't Stand Down, est publié le [3]. Trois autres singles sortent par la suite : Compliance, Will of the People, Kill or Be Killed puis un cinquième le jour de la sortie de l’album : You Make Me Feel Like It’s Halloween. Ghosts (How Can I Move On) sortira en Novembre 2022 en single hors album avec deux collaborations.\\nAvec 10 morceaux et 37 minutes 35 secondes, il s'agit de l’album le plus court de la discographie du groupe et le premier album de l’industrie musicale à sortir au format NFT.\\nDéveloppement\\n[modifier | modifier le code]Après s'être essayé dans deux projets musicaux en 2020, un album avec le supergroupe The Jaded Hearts Club et des compositions en solo, Matthew Bellamy annonce dans le numéro d'août 2020 de Total Guitar et sur la page Facebook officielle du groupe le 3 août 2020 un retour en studio du groupe, probablement dès 2021, pour l’enregistrement de l'album, successeur de Simulation Theory paru en 2018. Cette fois-ci, l'album ne sera pas dirigé par Matt, mais pas Dominic Howard[4].\\nÀ l’origine, Warner Bros., le label du groupe, souhaitait un best of des plus gros succès du groupe. Ce dernier refuse et Matthew Bellamy propose à la place des compositions originales qui seraient chacune la « meilleure version de chaque style ». Il déclare au média MetalZone : « Nous étions arrivés à un point où il était question de faire un album de nos plus grands succès, et nous n’étions pas vraiment en faveur de cela. Donc on a presque fait un disque qui est une compilation de nos plus grands succès – mais avec de nouvelles chansons. Cela signifie que cet album contient un morceau de Metal – et c’est comme, le meilleur morceau de Metal que nous ayons jamais fait. Et il y a une sorte de ballade douce, une chanson d’amour, et c’est probablement la meilleure ballade d’amour qu’on ait jamais faite, et ainsi de suite. »[5].\\nLe , Matthew Bellamy fait un direct Instagram avec le compte du groupe à bord de sa voiture dans les rues de Los Angeles, accompagné de son fils, où il dévoile un extrait d'un morceau inédit intitulé Won't Stand Down en fond sonore. Le morceau se présente comme le plus heavy metal de la discographie du groupe[6]. Le , le titre, la pochette et la date de sortie du single sont officiellement annoncés par le groupe sur les réseaux sociaux[7].\\nLe , une courte vidéo postée par le groupe sur YouTube donne des indications sur la pochette de l'album et sur les titres qui composeront celui-ci. Deux jours plus tard, le deuxième single de l'album Compliance est annoncé sur les réseaux sociaux pour une sortie le jeudi [8]. Le single Compliance est alors publié sur les plateformes de streaming. Lors de cette sortie, le groupe dévoilet officiellement la date de sortie de l'album fixé au ainsi que la pochette, les pistes de l'album et les formats de sortie.\\nLe troisième single éponyme de l’album, Will of the People, sort le 1er juin 2022. Quelques jours plus tard, le groupe dévoile Kill or Be Killed, un quatrième extrait inédit de l’album lors du festival Rock am Ring en Allemagne[9], festival d’ouverture de la tournée d’été. Le titre sort officiellement le . Le , jour de la sortie de l'album, paraît You Make Me Feel Like It’s Halloween, cinquième extrait de l'album ainsi que le clip vidéo, à l'effigie des films d'horreur mythiques des années 1970-2000 comme Halloween, Scream, Vendredi 13, L'Exorciste, Misery, Shining, etc.\\nLe 25 novembre 2022, sort le sixième single, Ghosts (How Can I Move On). Il est accompagné d’une face-B, une version de la chanson en duo avec la chanteuse italienne Elisa Toffoli[10],[11]. Deux semaines plus tard, une version en français sort en duo avec la chanteuse Mylène Farmer[12],[13],[14].\\nL'album\\n[modifier | modifier le code]Artworks (album et singles)\\n[modifier | modifier le code]La pochette de l'album est dévoilée le à l’occasion de la sortie du deuxième extrait Compliance. Elle représente les têtes géantes sculptées en pierre des trois membres du groupe à moitié ensevelies et endommagées. Les visages sont tagués du monogramme « WOTP ». L’atmosphère lumineuse orangée et apocalyptique évoque un côté dramatique comme lors des incendies géants. Il s'agit du premier album depuis Black Holes and Revelations (2006) à ne pas faire apparaitre le logo du groupe sur la pochette et du deuxième album après Simulation Theory (2018) à faire apparaitre le visage des membres du groupe.\\nL'artwork de Won't Stand Down représente le personnage de Kueen, vêtu d'une toge noire à capuche et un masque métallique couvrant tout son visage survolant dix disciples casqués. Le nom du groupe est inscrit au centre, sous lequel se trouve le nom du morceau ainsi qu'un monogramme formé par la superposition des lettres W, O, T et P (initiales du titre de l'album Will of the People). Ce logo se retrouve également sur les costumes des disciples dans le clip de Won't Stand Down.\\nDans une courte vidéo publiée sur leur page internet le 8 mars 2022, le titre Will of the People est répété en boucle, qui correspondrait ainsi au monogramme WOTP visible dans le clip de Won't Stand Down.\\nLe photographe chargé de la communication du groupe pour cet album est Nick Fancher.\\nThèmes\\n[modifier | modifier le code]D'après le groupe sur le réseau social Instagram dans un texte en vidéo posté le 16 mars 2022, Will Of The People a été créé à Los Angeles et à Londres. Il est influencé par l'augmentation de l'instabilité dans le monde, la pandémie du COVID-19, la guerre en Ukraine, manifestations et émeutes massives à travers le globe, une tentative d'insurrection, des démocraties occidentales vacillantes, la montée de l'autoritarisme, les catastrophes naturelles liées aux changements climatiques comme les incendies de forêt[15],[16].\\nD’après Matthew Bellamy dans le magazine Metalzone à propos du premier single, « “Won’t Stand Down est une chanson qui parle de se défendre contre les brutes, que ce soit dans la cour de récréation, au travail ou ailleurs. [Cette chanson parle de] se protéger de la coercition et de la manipulation sociopathique et d’affronter l’adversité avec force, confiance et agressivité.” »[17].\\nDans une vidéo publiée les , le groupe donne une définition au mot « compliance », à propos du morceau du même nom : « La compliance est une promesse de sécurité et réconfort qui nous est vendue par les puissants en temps de vulnérabilité.

At the end, it is revealed that three of the rioters are infact the \\\"dicators\\\" (the band), which appear to be rioting against themselves. In the words of Matt Bellamy, \\\"\\\"Will of the People\\\" is fictional story set in a fictional metaverse on a fictional planet ruled by a fictional authoritarian state run by a fictional algorithm manifested by a fictional data centre running a fictional bank printing a fictional currency controlling a fictional population occupying a fictional city containing a fictional apartment where a fictional man woke up one day and thought \\\"fuck this.\\\"\\\"[1]\\nThe song's music video itself, being that of the title track, contains alot of elements which are seen in the album artwork. It was also previously used as a short teaser for the album announcement, in March of 2022.[2]\\nAdditional information\\nThe video was directed by Tom Teller and produced by Frame 48. The same production company also handled post-production and VFX for both the Simulation Theory Film and all of Simulation Theory's music videos, with Tom Teller as executive director on all projects. The visual performance was motion captured by parkour athlete, Didi Alaoui at one of the Tempest Freerunning Academies in the USA.\\nThis is the first music video during the Will of the People era which isn't filmed in the 4:3 format.\\nWill of the People Screenshots\\nCredits\\n- Studio: Frame48\\n- Freerunning Facility: Tempest Freerunning Academy\\n- Director: Tom Teller\\n- Creative Director: Jesse Lee Stout\\n- Executive Producers: Julian Conner, Seth Josephson, Tom Teller\\n- Performance Capture Athlete: Didi Alaoui\\n- FX Artist: Alvaro Moreira\\n- CG Supervisor & Lead Artist: Enrique De la Garza\\n- CG Artists: Steven Lee, Stephanie Buschhorn, Isaac Zuren\\n- Rigger: Jarom Brand\\n- Animators: Paolo Cogliati, Matheus Caetano\\n- Assistant Editor: Michele Nagy\\n- Compositors: Sai Prudhvi, Mahesh Kanneboina, Maryam Riahi, Sreedhar Krkumar\\n- Colorist: Bryan Smaller\\n- Sound Designer: Gerry Vazquez\\n- Character Artists: Mariano Ruiz Manzano, Isaac Olander\\n- Asset Artist: Juan Fer Bravo\\n- Storyboard Artist: David Green\\n</content>\\n\\nMake your judgment and output according to the requirements, determining whether the webpage content can fulfill the purpose of this search round\\n\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"max_tokens\": 8192,\n  \"cache_name\": \"OpenAIApiProxy.call\"\n}"}

This was the first tour of the Will of the People era, and first tour in three years, since the pandemic of …\\nContent: Will of the People Festivals Tour\\n| Gig nav | ||||\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n| Simulation Theory World Tour | ← | Will of the People Festivals Tour | → | Will of the People Theatre Tour |\\nA tour, spread out throughout the entire second half of 2022, and the beginning of 2023, during which Muse played festivals in both Europe, and the United States. The Will of the People Festivals Tour took place between June 2022 and January 2023. This was the first tour of the Will of the People era, and first tour in three years, since the pandemic of 2020.\\nInformation\\nThe tour began one month after the WOTP promo gigs, and first gigs since 2019 alltogether, in Exeter's Cavern Club and London's Apollo gigs, on June 4th, 2022, with a performance at Rock am Ring in Germany. As mentioned above, this was the first major tour, supporting the album, Will of the People. The tour included Muse's debut performances at Nova Rock, Aftershock and Audacy Beach festivals, aswell as performances at the Isle of Wight, Eurockéennes and Rock in Rio Lisbon festivals, amongst others. The tour also included a special, more intimate invite-only gig, at the James B. Beam Distillery in Kentucky, when Muse played a gig as part of Jim Beam Welcome Sessions.\\nWill of the People and Kill or Be Killed made their live debuts on the first leg of the tour, with Compliance and Won't Stand Down being played on the couple gigs before the tour. You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween made its debut on the second leg of the tour, in September. Nishe was brought back after 11 years, played before Madness, and also played in full for the first time since 2000. A Bellamy solo song, Behold, The Glove, returned, after last being present during the Simulation Theory World Tour in 2019, when it was played from tape as a short intro piece (then known as STT Interstitial 2). On this tour, the song was played in full, with the entire band.\\nThe day before the first gig, on June 3rd, 2022, the entire tour's setlist template was leaked on Twitter.\\nProduction\\nThe show was, in some aspects, similar to the afforementioned previous tour. Similar to Murph the Robot, the tour featured its counterpart, a large inflatable \\\"masked hacker\\\" figure, nicknamed \\\"Will the Hacker\\\", which was set up on-stage behind the band, and was present throughout most of the show (excluding the fist few songs). It was revealed during Won't Stand Down. The main difference between Will the Hacker and Murph is that the hacker was a lot bigger and bulkier. It's made up of three separate parts: Two shoulders, sitting on each side of the head, which was attached to trussing, rotating left to right slightly. Behind the hacker were two thin walls of LED light strips, also attached to top trussing. Lights were used to illuminate the inflatable figure from different angles throughout the show.\\nAlso similar to the Simulation Theory Tour was the use of The Power Glove. The difference, however, is, that, the new glove acted as an instrument, with a built-in smartphone, connected to the PA system, using a synthesizer app called \\\"NOISE\\\". Matt played Behold, The Glove and the synth intro of Uprising on the glove. While doing so, Bellamy wore an illuminating LED leather jacket, similar to the jacket worn during the previous tour.\\nKeeping with the heavier style of the new songs, the gigs relied on heavy use of pyro, specifically, fire. The show opened with a large burning \\\"WOTP\\\" monogram logo, placed behind the band, while they play the song Will of the People. The fire can be re-ignited quickly at any given time, with the ability to lit up each letter separately. Fire machines are used throughout the rest of the show, during Won't Stand Down, Madness, Thought Contagion, Uprising, Kill or Be Killed and (later on during the tour) Knights of Cydonia.\\nThree video interstitials, named \\\"Chant\\\", \\\"Parkour\\\" and \\\"Driving\\\" were played during the show. These included elements from Will of the People's music video. The \\\"Chant\\\" one was played before Will of the People, and showed the video of the stone heads being torn down, seen during the last part of the music video, and also in the album trailer, posted on Muse's YouTube channel. The \\\"Parkour\\\" one showed the rioter running and jumping over buildings, as seen during the music video's first part, and is played before Time Is Running Out. The \\\"Driving\\\" interstitial showed the vehicles from the music video being driven through the desert, and was played before Plug In Baby.\\nWith Mercy being dropped from the setlists, Compliance took over as the song during which streamers are released.\\nOn some dates, due to the logistics, some elements of the production weren't present on all gigs, or were swapped. This notably happened for the Lisbon gig at Rock in Rio, when the main production was headed to London, so the band were forced to use a minimal stage setup, which included replacing the figure of Will the Hacker with Murph the Robot, ditching the \\\"WOTP\\\" logo at the start, and changing the band's wardrobe. The same (or similar) minimal stage set-up was also present during the Telekom Street Gigs show in Cologne, Audacy Beach Festival in Fort Lauderdale and the iHeartRadio ALTer EGO in Los Angeles, while the burning logo itself didn't appear in Florence, at Firenze Rocks.\\nAverage Setlist\\n- Will of the People (extended intro)\\n- Interlude + Hysteria\\n- [Drill Sergeant] (robot voice) + Psycho\\n- Pressure\\n- Won't Stand Down\\n- Map of the Problematique / Stockholm Syndrome / Citizen Erased\\n- The Gallery\\n- Compliance (w/ guitar)\\n- Thought Contagion\\n- Time Is Running Out\\n- Nishe (shortened)\\n- Madness\\n- Supermassive Black Hole\\n- Plug In Baby (extended outro)\\n- Behold, The Glove (Matthew Bellamy song)\\n- Uprising (extended outro)\\n- Prelude + Starlight\\nEncore\\nNotes\\n- Map of the Problematique and Stockholm Syndrome share their outro riffs, being Duality, Calm Like a Bomb and the Unknown one, although they shuffle through them gig by gig.\\n- Nishe was initially only played as a short 1-minuite snippet, but it was later extended to almost 2 minutes after the third show.\\nExceptions\\n- Citizen Erased was played at the Rock am Ring gig as an extra song after Madness while Map of the Problematique was played in the rotation slot.\\n- For the first 4 shows of the tour, Thought Contagion was played between Supermassive Black Hole and Plug in Baby.\\n- At the Isle of Wight Festival, Won't Stand Down was played after the rotation slot while Citizen Erased was played in said slot.\\n- You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween got its debut at Xacobeo Festival. It was played after Thought Contagion and replaced the MOTP/Stockholm Syndrome/Citizen Erased slot and was played there through September.\\n- Tributing Queen Elizabeth II after her passing, \\\"God Save the Queen\\\" was played briefly at Xacobeo Festival, before Interlude.\\n- Telekom Street Gigs, James B. Beam Distillery had notably shorter setlists, with Thought Contagion, Time Is Running Out, Nishe and Madness all being dropped with no replacement and some of the remaining songs were shuffled around. The only setlist difference between the two (other than the order of the songs) is that Behold, The Glove was played at the former while Minimum was played at the latter. The 2023 iHeartRadio gig at Los Angeles+s The Kia Forum had the shortest setlist of all shows, with just nine songs, being Will of the People, Hysteria, Won't Stand Down, Madness, Compliance, Supermassive ...Omiting #2833 chars\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"max_tokens\": 8192,\n  \"cache_name\": \"OpenAIApiProxy.call\"\n}"}

Het album werd uitgebracht op 26 augustus 2022. De band was zelf verantwoordelijk voor de productie. Er werden vier singles uitgebracht voorafgaand aan het verschijnen van het album; 'Won't Stand Down', 'Compliance', 'Will of the People' en 'Kill or Be Killed'. De vijfde single van het album, 'You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween', werd uitgebracht op dezelfde dag dat het volledige album verscheen. Will of the People werd digitaal uitgebracht op verschillende streamingdiensten en op cd, vinyl en muziekcassette.\\nAchtergrond\\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]Het album werd opgenomen in Londen en Los Angeles. Volgens frontman Matthew Bellamy is het album beïnvloed door \\\"the increasing uncertainty and instability in the world.\\\" In een verklaring noemde hij onder andere de coronapandemie, oorlog in Europa (de Russische invasie van Oekraïne in 2022), grote onrust onder de bevolking en natuurrampen.[1] De band werd aangespoord om een greatest hits-album te maken, maar dat wezen de bandleden af. Will of the People bevat een mengelmoes van de verschillende genres die de band in het verleden heeft gespeeld en is in dat opzicht het antwoord geworden op het verzoek.[2]\\nWill of the People World Tour\\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]Op 7 april 2022 ving the Will of the People World Tour aan. Op die dag gaf de band het startschot van de tournee in de vorm van een besloten concert in Exeter.[3][4] Tot en met september werden er optredens verzorgd tijdens festivals in Europa. Vanaf oktober tot en met juni 2023 zijn er wereldwijd shows gepland. Muse wierf producer Dan Lancaster voor de liveband. Lancaster had eerder de single 'Won't Stand Down' gemixt.[5]\\nOntvangst\\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]Het album werd overwegend positief ontvangen. Op Metacritic kreeg Will of the People op basis van 11 recensies een gewogen gemiddelde score van 78/100, wat neerkomt op \\\"Generally favorable reviews\\\".[6] In de Benelux werd het album gematigd positief ontvangen. Zowel Alexander van Eenennaam van het Algemeen Dagblad als Gijsbert Kamer van de Volkskrant gaven twee van vijf sterren.[7][8] Floor Deckx van De Standaard gaf drie van vijf sterren.[9]\\nNummers\\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]| Nr. | Titel | Duur | |||||||\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n| 1. | Will of the People | 3:18 | |||||||\\n| 2. | Compliance | 4:10 | |||||||\\n| 3. | Liberation | 3:06 | |||||||\\n| 4. | Won't Stand Down | 3:30 | |||||||\\n| 5. | Ghosts (How Can I Move On) | 3:36 | |||||||\\n| 6. | You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween | 3:00 | |||||||\\n| 7. | Kill or Be Killed | 5:00 | |||||||\\n| 8. | Verona | 4:56 | |||||||\\n| 9. | Euphoria | 3:23 | |||||||\\n| 10. | We Are Fucking Fucked | 3:36 | |||||||\\n| Totale duur: 37:35 |\\nBezetting\\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]- Matthew Bellamy – zang, gitaren, keyboard\\n- Christopher Wolstenholme – basgitaar, zang\\n- Dominic Howard – drums\\nHitnoteringen\\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]Nederlandse Album Top 100\\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]| Hitnotering: (Week 1 t/m 7) 03-09-2022 t/m 15-10-2022 Hitnotering: (Week 8) 29-10-2022 Hitnotering: (Week 9 t/m 10) 10-06-2023 t/m 17-06-2023 | ||||||||||||\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n| Week: | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | ||\\n| Positie: | 2 | 9 | 11 | 19 | 17 | 42 | 78 | uit | 94 | uit | 63 | 81 |\\nVlaamse Ultratop 200 Albums\\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]| Hitnotering: (Week 1 t/m 13) 03-09-2022 t/m 26-11-2022 Hitnotering: (Week 14 t/m 16) 10-12-2022 t/m 24-12-2022 Hitnotering: (Week 17) 08-07-2023 | |||||||||||||||||||\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n| Week: | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | ||\\n| Positie: | 2 | 8 | 20 | 21 | 17 | 37 | 85 | 143 | 100 | 106 | 83 | 143 | 143 | uit | 150 | 125 | 129 | uit | 155 |\\nExterne links\\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]- (en) Will of the People op Discogs\\n- (en) Will of the People op Muse.mu\\n- (en) Will of the People op MuseWiki\\n- ↑ (en) Moore, Sam, Muse announce new album ‘Will Of The People’ and share new single ‘Compliance’.

Joining the two is Twin Atlantic, who opened together with The Warning on the afforementioned Bellahouston Park gig in Glasgow.[7] A support change was made for the gig in Bern, Switzerland, as One Ok Rock couldn't perform at due to unforeseen circumstances; Replacing them was Emilie Zoé. Kyoto Protocol were announced as the support act for the Kuala Lumpur gig only a few weeks before the show itself, on July 11th, 2023.\\nOn June 26th, alongside the annoucement of the UK and Ireland indoor gigs, Nova Twins were announced to be supporting Muse on these gigs.[8]\\nProduction\\nAs with the previous large headlining tour, the Simulation Theory World Tour, this tour features indoor, outdoor and festival shows. The stage set-up in general is a hybrid between the 2022 festivals tour and the autumn theatre tour setups. It includes an inflatable rotating figure of Will the Hacker as a backdrop, together with a grid of light fixtures, similar to the one from the theatre tour. Joining Will the Hacker is a new figure nicknamed \\\"Baph\\\".\\nThe festival setup (which was also used during the Mexican leg of the tour) bears more resemblance to the 2022 summer festivals setup, with the only major difference being an addition of the lighting grid, replacing the LED strip lights behind the band. An inflatable figure of Will is present throughout the entire show, including the encore, while the setlists themselves (exceptions being the Mexican shows) include no rotations, and are more akin to the 2022 summer festivals setlists\\nThe indoor setup, which premiered at the North American leg, features a stage wi...Omiting #14053 chars\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"max_tokens\": 8192,\n  \"cache_name\": \"OpenAIApiProxy.call\"\n}"}

On 14 July, Muse confirmed through social media that \\\"Kill or Be Killed\\\" would be released as the fourth single ahead of Will of the People one week later on 21 July 2022, with a thirty-second snippet of the studio version of the song becoming available to preview through TikTok later that day.[2]\\nWriting and composition\\n[edit]Prior to the live debut of \\\"Kill or Be Killed\\\", in an interview with Apple Music 1 on 17 March 2022, Matt Bellamy described \\\"Kill or Be Killed\\\" as \\\"the best metal/prog track we've ever done\\\", featuring \\\"industrial-tinged, granite-heavy guitar riffs\\\".[3] Music journalists described \\\"Kill or Be Killed\\\" as progressive metal,[4][5] heavy metal,[6] alternative metal,[7] and metalcore.[8]\\nFor the guitar solo, Bellamy combined a tapping technique with a DigiTech Whammy, a pitch-shifting pedal, to shift rapidly between octaves. He said, \\\"I'm plainly cheating in that solo ... It sounds like I’m doing insane arpeggios. I'm not a shredder at all. I've never been a very good shredder, but I found ways to cut corners.\\\"[9]\\nCharts\\n[edit]| Chart (2022) | Peak position |\\n|---|---|\\n| UK Singles Sales (OCC)[10] | 81 |\\n| UK Singles Downloads (OCC)[11] | 80 |\\n| UK Rock & Metal (OCC)[12] | 20 |\\n| US Rock Airplay (Billboard)[13] | 37 |\\nReferences\\n[edit]- ^ Shutler, Ali (5 June 2022). \\\"Watch Muse perform new song 'Kill Or Be Killed' as they kick off summer tour\\\".

The album was self-produced. It is a genre-hopping album that Matthew Bellamy described as \\\"a greatest hits album – of new songs.\\\"[2] \\\"Won't Stand Down\\\", \\\"Compliance\\\", \\\"Will of the People\\\", and \\\"Kill or Be Killed\\\" were released as singles before the album was released, and \\\"You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween\\\" was released as a single the same day the album came out.\\nThe album received generally positive reviews and became Muse's seventh consecutive number-one album in the UK.[3] A world tour in support of the album, the Will of the People World Tour, began in April 2022 and concluded in November 2023.[4][5] It was ranked as the #17 best guitar album of 2022 by Guitar World readers.[6]\\nRemove ads\\nBackground and recording\\nAbout the origins of the album, Matthew Bellamy related that Warner Records requested a greatest hits album from Muse, but, instead, the band decided to make an album that was a \\\"montage\\\" of \\\"all of those types of genres that we’ve touched on in the past\\\" and would feel like \\\"a greatest hits album – of new songs.\\\"[2] Warner stated that the album spans multiple genres, describing \\\"Will of the People\\\" as a \\\"glam rocker\\\" and \\\"Kill or Be Killed\\\" as \\\"industrial\\\".[7]\\nBellamy said the lyrics on the album were inspired by \\\"the increasing uncertainty and instability in the world [...] as the Western empire and the natural world, which have cradled us for so long, are genuinely threatened.

The song is intended to be a \\\"populist parody, almost the antithesis to 'Uprising',\\\" another Muse song with a similar anti-establishment theme that instead \\\"[takes] it seriously.\\\"[8]\\nMusic video\\neditThe music video for \\\"Will of the People\\\" was released on 1 June 2022 at 15:00 BST (UTC+1), the same day as the single was released. The music video for \\\"Will of the People\\\" follows on from the videos for previous singles \\\"Won't Stand Down\\\" and \\\"Compliance\\\", continuing the same themes and following the same characters.[4]\\nThe video, directed and animated by Tom Teller,[4] is set in a dystopian city in which a revolution takes place. The video opens with a person receiving a delivery of a metallic mask, the same as the mask featured in the \\\"Won't Stand Down\\\" and \\\"Compliance\\\" music videos; he is later revealed to be Will the Hacker, the leader of the revolution. As the video progresses, a growing number of revolutionaries advance through the city,[7] destroying security cameras, spraying \\\"Will of the People\\\" logo graffiti onto walls, tearing down statues and attacking the building belonging to the Ministry of Truth,[9] in reference to George Orwell's dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four.\\nAs the Ministry of Truth building explodes and continues to burn, the city's electricity supply and mobile phone signals are shut down in an attempt to smother the revolution. The leaders of the revolution depart the city in futuristic supercars,[7] resembling Tesla Cybertrucks, heading into the desert as the skyline of the city burns behind them.[7][9] In the desert the revolutionaries find three ancient statues of the faces of band members Matt Bellamy, Dominic Howard and Chris Wolstenholme carved in the style of Mount Rushmore; they are destroyed by being pulled to the ground with cables, before being covered in \\\"Will of the People\\\" logo graffiti. Three members take off their masks, revealing themselves as the members of Muse.[7][9]\\nThe music video for \\\"Will of the People\\\" references multiple forms of popular culture; as well as Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, the video has been compared to \\\"V for Vendetta set in [the] Blade Runner 2049 universe\\\".[4]\\nPersonnel\\neditCredits adapted from Tidal.[10]\\nMuse\\n- Matt Bellamy – lead vocals, guitars, composition, production, engineering\\n- Chris Wolstenholme – bass guitar, production, engineering\\n- Dominic Howard – drums, production, engineering\\nProduction\\n- Aleks Von Korff – additional production, engineering\\n- Chris Gehringer – mastering\\n- Serban Ghenea – mixing\\n- Bryce Bordone – mixing engineer\\n- Andy Maxwell – studio assistant\\n- Joe Devenney – studio assistant\\n- Tommy Bosustow – studio assistant\\n- Chris Whitemyer – technical assistant\\n- Paul Warren – technical assistant\\nCharts\\nedit| Chart (2022) | Peak position |\\n|---|---|\\n| Canada Rock (Billboard)[11] | 44 |\\n| Czech Republic Rock (IFPI)[12] | 12 |\\n| Japan Hot Overseas (Billboard)[13] | 19 |\\n| New Zealand Hot Singles (RMNZ)[14] | 25 |\\n| UK Singles Sales (OCC)[15] | 96 |\\n| UK Singles Downloads (OCC)[16] | 93 |\\n| UK Rock & Metal (OCC)[17] | 11 |\\n| US Mainstream Rock (Billboard)[18] | 23 |\\nReferences\\nedit- ^ \\\"WOTP August 26th.

Het album werd uitgebracht op 26 augustus 2022. De band was zelf verantwoordelijk voor de productie. Er werden vier singles uitgebracht voorafgaand aan het verschijnen van het album; 'Won't Stand Down', 'Compliance', 'Will of the People' en 'Kill or Be Killed'. De vijfde single van het album, 'You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween', werd uitgebracht op dezelfde dag dat het volledige album verscheen. Will of the People werd digitaal uitgebracht op verschillende streamingdiensten en op cd, vinyl en muziekcassette.\\nAchtergrond\\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]Het album werd opgenomen in Londen en Los Angeles. Volgens frontman Matthew Bellamy is het album beïnvloed door \\\"the increasing uncertainty and instability in the world.\\\" In een verklaring noemde hij onder andere de coronapandemie, oorlog in Europa (de Russische invasie van Oekraïne in 2022), grote onrust onder de bevolking en natuurrampen.[1] De band werd aangespoord om een greatest hits-album te maken, maar dat wezen de bandleden af. Will of the People bevat een mengelmoes van de verschillende genres die de band in het verleden heeft gespeeld en is in dat opzicht het antwoord geworden op het verzoek.[2]\\nWill of the People World Tour\\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]Op 7 april 2022 ving the Will of the People World Tour aan. Op die dag gaf de band het startschot van de tournee in de vorm van een besloten concert in Exeter.[3][4] Tot en met september werden er optredens verzorgd tijdens festivals in Europa. Vanaf oktober tot en met juni 2023 zijn er wereldwijd shows gepland. Muse wierf producer Dan Lancaster voor de liveband. Lancaster had eerder de single 'Won't Stand Down' gemixt.[5]\\nOntvangst\\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]Het album werd overwegend positief ontvangen. Op Metacritic kreeg Will of the People op basis van 11 recensies een gewogen gemiddelde score van 78/100, wat neerkomt op \\\"Generally favorable reviews\\\".[6] In de Benelux werd het album gematigd positief ontvangen. Zowel Alexander van Eenennaam van het Algemeen Dagblad als Gijsbert Kamer van de Volkskrant gaven twee van vijf sterren.[7][8] Floor Deckx van De Standaard gaf drie van vijf sterren.[9]\\nNummers\\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]| Nr. | Titel | Duur | |||||||\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n| 1. | Will of the People | 3:18 | |||||||\\n| 2. | Compliance | 4:10 | |||||||\\n| 3. | Liberation | 3:06 | |||||||\\n| 4. | Won't Stand Down | 3:30 | |||||||\\n| 5. | Ghosts (How Can I Move On) | 3:36 | |||||||\\n| 6. | You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween | 3:00 | |||||||\\n| 7. | Kill or Be Killed | 5:00 | |||||||\\n| 8. | Verona | 4:56 | |||||||\\n| 9. | Euphoria | 3:23 | |||||||\\n| 10. | We Are Fucking Fucked | 3:36 | |||||||\\n| Totale duur: 37:35 |\\nBezetting\\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]- Matthew Bellamy – zang, gitaren, keyboard\\n- Christopher Wolstenholme – basgitaar, zang\\n- Dominic Howard – drums\\nHitnoteringen\\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]Nederlandse Album Top 100\\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]| Hitnotering: (Week 1 t/m 7) 03-09-2022 t/m 15-10-2022 Hitnotering: (Week 8) 29-10-2022 Hitnotering: (Week 9 t/m 10) 10-06-2023 t/m 17-06-2023 | ||||||||||||\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n| Week: | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | ||\\n| Positie: | 2 | 9 | 11 | 19 | 17 | 42 | 78 | uit | 94 | uit | 63 | 81 |\\nVlaamse Ultratop 200 Albums\\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]| Hitnotering: (Week 1 t/m 13) 03-09-2022 t/m 26-11-2022 Hitnotering: (Week 14 t/m 16) 10-12-2022 t/m 24-12-2022 Hitnotering: (Week 17) 08-07-2023 | |||||||||||||||||||\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n| Week: | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | ||\\n| Positie: | 2 | 8 | 20 | 21 | 17 | 37 | 85 | 143 | 100 | 106 | 83 | 143 | 143 | uit | 150 | 125 | 129 | uit | 155 |\\nExterne links\\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]- (en) Will of the People op Discogs\\n- (en) Will of the People op Muse.mu\\n- (en) Will of the People op MuseWiki\\n- ↑ (en) Moore, Sam, Muse announce new album ‘Will Of The People’ and share new single ‘Compliance’.

The album was self-produced. It is a genre-hopping album that Matthew Bellamy described as \\\"a greatest hits album – of new songs.\\\"[2] \\\"Won't Stand Down\\\", \\\"Compliance\\\", \\\"Will of the People\\\", and \\\"Kill or Be Killed\\\" were released as singles before the album was released, and \\\"You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween\\\" was released as a single the same day the album came out.\\nThe album received generally positive reviews and became Muse's seventh consecutive number-one album in the UK.[3] A world tour in support of the album, the Will of the People World Tour, began in April 2022 and concluded in November 2023.[4][5] It was ranked as the #17 best guitar album of 2022 by Guitar World readers.[6]\\nBackground and recording\\n[edit]About the origins of the album, Matthew Bellamy related that Warner Records requested a greatest hits album from Muse, but, instead, the band decided to make an album that was a \\\"montage\\\" of \\\"all of those types of genres that we’ve touched on in the past\\\" and would feel like \\\"a greatest hits album – of new songs.\\\"[2] Warner stated that the album spans multiple genres, describing \\\"Will of the People\\\" as a \\\"glam rocker\\\" and \\\"Kill or Be Killed\\\" as \\\"industrial\\\".[7]\\nBellamy said the lyrics on the album were inspired by \\\"the increasing uncertainty and instability in the world [...] as the Western empire and the natural world, which have cradled us for so long, are genuinely threatened. This album is a personal navigation through those fears and preparation for what comes next.\\\"[8]\\nThe album was recorded at Bellamy's Red Room studio in Santa Monica, California,[9] as well as at Black Lodge and Abbey Road Studios in London.[10]\\nPromotion and release\\n[edit]The first snippet from the album was heard on 25 December 2021, when Bellamy briefly livestreamed himself and his 10-year-old son, Bing, listening to the song \\\"Won't Stand Down\\\".[11][12] About two weeks later, Muse announced the song would be released on 13 January 2022, making it their first single since \\\"Pressure\\\" in September 2018.[12] The second single from the album, \\\"Compliance\\\", was released on 17 March, alongside the announcement of the album and its release date of 26 August.[13][14]\\nThe third single from the album was the title track, which was released on 1 June 2022.[4][15] That same month, Muse began the European festival leg of their Will of the People World Tour, on which they played all three of the new singles live, as well as a then-unreleased track from the album, \\\"Kill or Be Killed\\\".[16] On 21 July, \\\"Kill or Be Killed\\\" was released as the album's fourth single.[17][18] On 23 August, Muse announced that a fifth single from the album, \\\"You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween\\\", would be released on 26 August, the same day as the release of the album.[19][20]\\nAn Italian-language version of \\\"Ghosts (How Can I Move On)\\\" featuring Elisa was released on 25 November 2022,[21] and a French-language version featuring Mylène Farmer was released two weeks later, on 9 December.[22]\\nOn 1 August 2022, it was announced that Will of the People could be purchased as a non-fungible token (NFT) on the \\\"eco-friendly\\\" Polygon-powered platform Serenade, and that it would be the first album for which NFT sales would qualify for the UK and Australian charts.[23][24] Per The Guardian: \\\"The Muse NFT album will retail for £20 and will be limited to 1,000 copies globally. As both an NFT and a limited-edition format, it is relatively sparse in its offering. Buyers will get a downloadable version of the album – complete with different sleeve – as high-res FLAC files; the members of Muse will digitally sign it and each of the 1,000 buyers will have their names permanently listed on the linked roster of purchasers.\\\"[24]\\nComposition\\n[edit]Musically, Will of the People has been described as glam rock,[25][26] alternative rock,[27] synth-pop,[25] arena rock,[25] hard rock,[28] progressive rock,[28] heavy metal,[29] progressive metal,[28] industrial metal,[26] and electropop.[26]\\nCritical reception\\n[edit]| Aggregate scores | |\\n|---|---|\\n| Source | Rating |\\n| AnyDecentMusic? | 6.5/10[30] |\\n| Metacritic | 71/100[31] |\\n| Review scores | |\\n| Source | Rating |\\n| AllMusic | [32] |\\n| Clash | 7/10[27] |\\n| Classic Rock | [33] |\\n| DIY | [34] |\\n| Gigwise | [35] |\\n| Kerrang! | 4/5[36] |\\n| MusicOMH | [37] |\\n| NME | [38] |\\n| Pitchfork | 3.7/10[39] |\\n| Sputnikmusic | 3.5/5[40] |\\nWill of the People received generally positive reviews from critics.

Il est le successeur de Simulation Theory, paru en 2018. L'album a été écrit à Los Angeles et enregistré en 2021 au studio Abbey Road à Londres, tout juste 20 ans après Origin of Symmetry, dernier album du groupe ayant été enregistré dans ce studio[2].\\nLe premier single issu de l'album, Won't Stand Down, est publié le [3]. Trois autres singles sortent par la suite : Compliance, Will of the People, Kill or Be Killed puis un cinquième le jour de la sortie de l’album : You Make Me Feel Like It’s Halloween. Ghosts (How Can I Move On) sortira en Novembre 2022 en single hors album avec deux collaborations.\\nAvec 10 morceaux et 37 minutes 35 secondes, il s'agit de l’album le plus court de la discographie du groupe et le premier album de l’industrie musicale à sortir au format NFT.\\nDéveloppement\\n[modifier | modifier le code]Après s'être essayé dans deux projets musicaux en 2020, un album avec le supergroupe The Jaded Hearts Club et des compositions en solo, Matthew Bellamy annonce dans le numéro d'août 2020 de Total Guitar et sur la page Facebook officielle du groupe le 3 août 2020 un retour en studio du groupe, probablement dès 2021, pour l’enregistrement de l'album, successeur de Simulation Theory paru en 2018. Cette fois-ci, l'album ne sera pas dirigé par Matt, mais pas Dominic Howard[4].\\nÀ l’origine, Warner Bros., le label du groupe, souhaitait un best of des plus gros succès du groupe. Ce dernier refuse et Matthew Bellamy propose à la place des compositions originales qui seraient chacune la « meilleure version de chaque style ». Il déclare au média MetalZone : « Nous étions arrivés à un point où il était question de faire un album de nos plus grands succès, et nous n’étions pas vraiment en faveur de cela. Donc on a presque fait un disque qui est une compilation de nos plus grands succès – mais avec de nouvelles chansons. Cela signifie que cet album contient un morceau de Metal – et c’est comme, le meilleur morceau de Metal que nous ayons jamais fait. Et il y a une sorte de ballade douce, une chanson d’amour, et c’est probablement la meilleure ballade d’amour qu’on ait jamais faite, et ainsi de suite. »[5].\\nLe , Matthew Bellamy fait un direct Instagram avec le compte du groupe à bord de sa voiture dans les rues de Los Angeles, accompagné de son fils, où il dévoile un extrait d'un morceau inédit intitulé Won't Stand Down en fond sonore. Le morceau se présente comme le plus heavy metal de la discographie du groupe[6]. Le , le titre, la pochette et la date de sortie du single sont officiellement annoncés par le groupe sur les réseaux sociaux[7].\\nLe , une courte vidéo postée par le groupe sur YouTube donne des indications sur la pochette de l'album et sur les titres qui composeront celui-ci. Deux jours plus tard, le deuxième single de l'album Compliance est annoncé sur les réseaux sociaux pour une sortie le jeudi [8]. Le single Compliance est alors publié sur les plateformes de streaming. Lors de cette sortie, le groupe dévoilet officiellement la date de sortie de l'album fixé au ainsi que la pochette, les pistes de l'album et les formats de sortie.\\nLe troisième single éponyme de l’album, Will of the People, sort le 1er juin 2022. Quelques jours plus tard, le groupe dévoile Kill or Be Killed, un quatrième extrait inédit de l’album lors du festival Rock am Ring en Allemagne[9], festival d’ouverture de la tournée d’été. Le titre sort officiellement le . Le , jour de la sortie de l'album, paraît You Make Me Feel Like It’s Halloween, cinquième extrait de l'album ainsi que le clip vidéo, à l'effigie des films d'horreur mythiques des années 1970-2000 comme Halloween, Scream, Vendredi 13, L'Exorciste, Misery, Shining, etc.\\nLe 25 novembre 2022, sort le sixième single, Ghosts (How Can I Move On). Il est accompagné d’une face-B, une version de la chanson en duo avec la chanteuse italienne Elisa Toffoli[10],[11]. Deux semaines plus tard, une version en français sort en duo avec la chanteuse Mylène Farmer[12],[13],[14].\\nL'album\\n[modifier | modifier le code]Artworks (album et singles)\\n[modifier | modifier le code]La pochette de l'album est dévoilée le à l’occasion de la sortie du deuxième extrait Compliance. Elle représente les têtes géantes sculptées en pierre des trois membres du groupe à moitié ensevelies et endommagées. Les visages sont tagués du monogramme « WOTP ». L’atmosphère lumineuse orangée et apocalyptique évoque un côté dramatique comme lors des incendies géants. Il s'agit du premier album depuis Black Holes and Revelations (2006) à ne pas faire apparaitre le logo du groupe sur la pochette et du deuxième album après Simulation Theory (2018) à faire apparaitre le visage des membres du groupe.\\nL'artwork de Won't Stand Down représente le personnage de Kueen, vêtu d'une toge noire à capuche et un masque métallique couvrant tout son visage survolant dix disciples casqués. Le nom du groupe est inscrit au centre, sous lequel se trouve le nom du morceau ainsi qu'un monogramme formé par la superposition des lettres W, O, T et P (initiales du titre de l'album Will of the People). Ce logo se retrouve également sur les costumes des disciples dans le clip de Won't Stand Down.\\nDans une courte vidéo publiée sur leur page internet le 8 mars 2022, le titre Will of the People est répété en boucle, qui correspondrait ainsi au monogramme WOTP visible dans le clip de Won't Stand Down.\\nLe photographe chargé de la communication du groupe pour cet album est Nick Fancher.\\nThèmes\\n[modifier | modifier le code]D'après le groupe sur le réseau social Instagram dans un texte en vidéo posté le 16 mars 2022, Will Of The People a été créé à Los Angeles et à Londres. Il est influencé par l'augmentation de l'instabilité dans le monde, la pandémie du COVID-19, la guerre en Ukraine, manifestations et émeutes massives à travers le globe, une tentative d'insurrection, des démocraties occidentales vacillantes, la montée de l'autoritarisme, les catastrophes naturelles liées aux changements climatiques comme les incendies de forêt[15],[16].\\nD’après Matthew Bellamy dans le magazine Metalzone à propos du premier single, « “Won’t Stand Down est une chanson qui parle de se défendre contre les brutes, que ce soit dans la cour de récréation, au travail ou ailleurs. [Cette chanson parle de] se protéger de la coercition et de la manipulation sociopathique et d’affronter l’adversité avec force, confiance et agressivité.” »[17].\\nDans une vidéo publiée les , le groupe donne une définition au mot « compliance », à propos du morceau du même nom : « La compliance est une promesse de sécurité et réconfort qui nous est vendue par les puissants en temps de vulnérabilité. Les gangs, les gouvernements, les démagogues, les médias sociaux, les algorithmes et les religions nous séduisent par des tromperies de contrevérités et des fables réconfortantes. Ils veulent nous faire adhérer à leur vision étroite du monde, nous faire obéir et fermer les yeux sur nos propres voix intérieure de la raison et de la compassion. Ils ont juste besoin de notre compliance. »[8]. Cette définition donnée par le groupe établie que les entités dites « supérieures » manipulent les foules en modifiant la vision des sociétés, les idées en la modelant à leur propre valeurs, une vision étriquée et non tolérante[18].\\nSonorités\\n[modifier | modifier le code]L'album est principalement composé de sonorités rock et acoustiques.

Nella sua disamina, il critico si è soffermato sulla tendenza del gruppo verso il ricalcare i propri stilemi classici, a discapito della sperimentazione che aveva caratterizzato le pubblicazioni precedenti.[24]\\nTracce\\n[modifica | modifica wikitesto]Testi e musiche di Matthew Bellamy.\\n- Will of the People – 3:18\\n- Compliance – 4:10\\n- Liberation – 3:06\\n- Won't Stand Down – 3:29\\n- Ghosts (How Can I Move On) – 3:37\\n- You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween – 3:00\\n- Kill or Be Killed – 4:59\\n- Verona – 4:57\\n- Euphoria – 3:23\\n- We Are Fucking Fucked – 3:36\\nFormazione\\n[modifica | modifica wikitesto]Hanno partecipato alle registrazioni, secondo le note di copertina:[25]\\n- Gruppo\\n- Matthew Bellamy – voce, chitarra tastiera, pianoforte, cori (traccia 1), GuitarViol (traccia 4)[26]\\n- Chris Wolstenholme – basso, cori (traccia 1)\\n- Dominic Howard – batteria, cori (traccia 1)\\n- Altri musicisti (traccia 1)\\n- Elle Bellamy – cori\\n- Bing Bellamy – cori\\n- Caris Wolstenholme – cori\\n- Ernie Wostenholme – cori\\n- Buster Wolstenholme – cori\\n- Teddi Wolstenholme – cori\\n- Tabitha Wolstenholme Tolhurst – cori\\n- Indiana Wolstenholme Tolhurst – cori\\n- Produzione\\n- Muse – produzione, ingegneria del suono, direzione artistica\\n- Aleks von Korff – produzione aggiuntiva, ingegneria del suono, missaggio al Red Room (traccia 7)\\n- Şerban Ghenea – missaggio ai MixStar Studios (eccetto tracce 4 e 7)\\n- Bryce Bordone – assistenza al missaggio ai MixStar Studios (eccetto tracce 4 e 7)\\n- Chris Gehringer – mastering al Sterling Sound\\n- Joe Devenney – assistenza tecnica al Red Room, missaggio al Red Room (traccia 7)\\n- Andy Maxwell – assistenza tecnica agli Abbey Road Studios\\n- Chris Whitemyer – assistenza tecnica\\n- Paul Warren – assistenza tecnica\\n- Dan Lancaster – missaggio al The Steam Room Studio (traccia 4)\\n- Rhys May – assistenza al missaggio al The Steam Room Studio (traccia 4)\\n- Adrian Bushby – ingegneria del suono aggiuntiva (traccia 7)\\n- Jesse Less Stout – direzione creativa, direzione artistica, copertina, grafica gatefold\\n- Tiago Marinho – copertina, grafica gatefold\\n- Tyrone Yarde – copertina, grafica gatefold\\n- Gabriella Russo – copertina, grafica gatefold\\n- Nick Fancher – fotografia\\n- Andrea \\\"Waarp\\\" Marcias – grafica retro e CD\\nClassifiche\\n[modifica | modifica wikitesto]Classifiche settimanali\\n[modifica | modifica wikitesto]| Classifica (2022) | Posizione massima |\\n|---|---|\\n| Australia[27] | 1 |\\n| Austria[27] | 1 |\\n| Belgio (Fiandre)[27] | 2 |\\n| Belgio (Vallonia)[27] | 1 |\\n| Canada[28] | 5 |\\n| Croazia[29] | 1 |\\n| Danimarca[27] | 18 |\\n| Finlandia[27] | 2 |\\n| Francia[27] | 1 |\\n| Germania[27] | 2 |\\n| Giappone[30] | 20 |\\n| Grecia[31] | 36 |\\n| Irlanda[32] | 2 |\\n| Islanda[33] | 13 |\\n| Italia[27] | 1 |\\n| Norvegia[27] | 16 |\\n| Nuova Zelanda[27] | 1 |\\n| Paesi Bassi[27] | 2 |\\n| Polonia[34] | 6 |\\n| Portogallo[27] | 1 |\\n| Regno Unito[35] | 1 |\\n| Repubblica Ceca[36] | 37 |\\n| Slovacchia[37] | 51 |\\n| Spagna[27] | 2 |\\n| Stati Uniti[28] | 15 |\\n| Svezia[27] | 27 |\\n| Svizzera[27] | 1 |\\n| Ungheria[38] | 3 |\\nNote\\n[modifica | modifica wikitesto]- ^ (EN) Neil Z.

Since a lot has happened during these years, it, thematically, explores everything from Black Lives Matter protests, to the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdowns, to the 2021 Capitol riots, and much more.\\nAccording to Muse, \\\"Will of the People was created in Los Angeles and London and is influenced by increasing uncertainty and instability in the world. A pandemic, new wars in Europe, massive protests & riots, an attempted insurrection, Western democracy wavering, rising authoritarianism, wildfires and natural disasters and the destabilisation of the global order all informed Will of the People. It has been a worrying and scary time for all of us as the Western empire and the natural world, which we have cradled us for so long are genuinely threatened. This album is a personal navigation through those fears and preparation for what comes next.\\\"[5]\\nIn an interview with Zane Lowe, upon announcing the album, on March 17th, 2022, Bellamy said about it, that the label originally planned them to release a best-of compilation of existing songs (later elaborating on that, saying that a \\\"Best-Of Album\\\" possibility is in their contract[6]). They instead decided to make a new album, which, musically, encapsulates and recaps the Muse's best work from past albums. As Bellamy said in an interview with a French radio station \\\"RTL 2\\\" in June of 2022, with the release of Origin of Muse and Origin of Symmetry's 20th Anniversary Remix, the band listened to a lot of their old music during the writing and recording process, and were thinking about certain things and ideas that they tried to do in the past, but they didn't work out. As an example, he mentioned Kill or Be Killed; Saying that \\\"2 to 3 times in our career, we've tried to create something that kind of...resembled metal or something, but we couldn't quite go there\\\".[7] As such, as mentioned by Bellamy on the Zane Lowe interview, the album goes \\\"all the way, from metal, to pop, to my first version of an Adele piano-like song, to electronica\\\", featuring songs like Kill or Be Killed, which is \\\"the best prog metal song they've ever done that could've been on Drones\\\", becoming a fan-favourite after just a few live performances, and We Are Fucking Fucked, which he sees as \\\"the weirdest, darkest lost B-side of Muse's life\\\", while also including songs like Liberation, which is, according to NME, a Queen-like ballad song and Verona, bringing \\\"purity to the nostalgic electronic textures\\\", as described by Warner themselves .[8]\\nIn the same interview, he mentioned that he let Dom Howard take the lead in terms of decisions on this album, jokingly saying that this is why the album, from start to finish, took so long, saying that Howard took time with the process. On top of that, he added that the album was self-produced by the band themselves,[9] however it was made with help and assistance from Aleks Von Korff.\\nTaking in account previous mention of Bellamy's idea of 'era blending' and 'best-of' album, Will of The People presents songs that are reminiscent of their previous albums, Will Of The People harks back to songs like Psycho and Uprising; Compliance seemingly a new feature, presents influences from the 90s with a texture from Simulation Theory; Liberation is a song that could have been released on The Resistance; Won't Stand Down, presents patterns and verses that could have been present on Origin of Symmetry with its metal influence with the strings; Ghosts (How Can I Move On), a song that could be the one that Matt described as an 'Adele type of song'; You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween, a song that could be released Simulation Theory with its 80's inspired sound ala Rockwell's Somebody's Watching Me; Kill or Be Killed, is intriguing due the mix of influences, ranging from Absolution, and Black Holes and Revelations to Drones with its metal riffs; Verona presents sounds similar the ones from The 2nd Law, like Follow Me and Madness, with its synths and U2 esque patterns and riffs; Euphoria, similar to the songs from Simulation Theory, presents synths straight out of the 70s and 80s, similar to the works of Donna Summer and Giorgio Moroder; Finally, the closer, 'We Are Fucking Fucked', presents sounds harking back to Showbiz, Origin of Symmetry and The 2nd Law with a riff similar to Knights of Cydonia.\\nBackground\\nAfter the Simulation Theory World Tour ended in 2019, Bellamy came up with the idea for the album, which, according to his interview with NME, was that they'd \\\"make it a bit more about what’s actually happening in the world right now\\\", adding \\\"what I didn’t know was what was about to happen.\\\" [10] Later, in January of 2020, Matt first publicly hinted at working on new Muse material in an interview with ALT 98.7 FM, backstage at the ALTerEGO Festival. He said that the goal for 2020 was to work on new Muse material. The plans were brought to halt due to the coronavirus pandemic, as the three were unable to get together due to the lockdowns. Bellamy instead focused on releasing his solo material. Later that year, in May, Matt further hinted on working on Muse material in an interview with Zane Lowe on Beats 1 Radio, saying that he has a few pieces written that are suited for Muse.[11] In an interview with Rolling Stone, also in May, he said that that the idea would be to record the album in 2021 and go on a tour in 2022.[12]\\nLater, in 2021, Bellamy further confirmed that work on the new Muse album has begun, in an interview with The Jaded Hearts Club Band for The Sun.[13] Bellamy said the following: \\\"I started writing when all the protests and all the chaos were kicking off. It’s a weird thing to say but it suits the music I write. It keeps you a little bit on edge.\\\" Additionally, Bellamy jokingly said, in an Instagram comment reply on Dom Howard's Instagram post, that the album would include \\\"emotional gasps and many usages of the word ‘soul’.\\\".\\nBellamy also had once got imbued with the recent label's request to release the greatest hits album of Muse's iconic songs from each eighth album they recorded, but they turned down the request and instead, they decide to produce a new album that combined with all various sounds and influences from each of their previous album into a new and fresh package with an additional comment by him as \\\"a greatest hits album - of a new songs - essentially\\\" [14] during Matt's interview with NME and the band interview with French radio talk show.\\nThe album, and its release date (August 26th, 2022) was finally announced on March 17th, 2022, together with the release of Compliance. The announcement, being six months apart from the release date, was met with mixed feelings from fans, however, since then, one more song has been released, another one performed live, and the fourth song still planned to be released before the album drops. Ordering the album from the official muse.mu website gives the buyer an exclusive chance to access the ticket pre-sale code for future gigs.\\nRecording\\nIn a 2019 interview with NME, Bellamy said that he'd like the idea of the band \\\"totally resetting\\\" and going back to their hometown of Teignmouth, Devon to rehearse and record the album. This was, however, not the case, as the first studio pictures that started to emerge were from Bellamy's own studio, named the Red Room, located in downtown Santa Monica, California, where, in March of 2021, the first proof of Muse being in the studio came from[15] The album was both written and part-recorded in the studio. With Chris in the UK and the rest of the band in the USA, and with all the lockdowns, this was mostly done remotely.

Given the lack of specific design elements such as character settings, plot outlines, or key story beats, it is essential to break down the task into smaller, manageable sub-tasks. This will ensure that the story is well-structured and engaging for an adult audience.\n\n1. **Design Sub-tasks**: \n   - **Core Elements Design**: Before writing, we need to design the core elements of the story, including the plot, characters, and setting. This will provide a solid foundation for the writing process.\n   - **Theme and Tone Design**: Since the story is intended for adults, it is crucial to determine the theme and tone. This could involve exploring mature themes or incorporating complex emotional or philosophical elements.\n   - **Conflict and Resolution Design**: A fairy story typically involves a conflict and its resolution. Designing these elements will help in crafting a compelling narrative.\n\n2. **Writing Sub-tasks**:\n   - **Introduction**: Introduce the setting and main characters, establishing the tone and theme of the story.\n   - **Development**: Develop the plot, introducing the conflict and exploring character dynamics.\n   - **Climax and Resolution**: Build up to the climax, resolving the conflict and concluding the story in a satisfying manner.\n\nBy breaking down the task into these sub-tasks, we can ensure that the story is cohesive and engaging, with a clear structure and well-developed characters and themes.

A high-level plan tailored to the user's novel-writing needs is already in place, and your task is to further recursively plan the specified writing sub-tasks within this framework. Through your planning, the resulting novel will strictly adhere to user requirements and achieve perfection in terms of plot, creativity (ideas, themes, and topics), and development.\\n\\n1. Continue the recursive planning for the specified professional novel-writing sub-tasks. According to narrative theory, the organization of story writing and the result of the design tasks, break the tasks down into more granular writing sub-tasks, specifying their scope and specific writing content.  \\n2. Plan design sub-tasks as needed to assist and support specific writing. Design sub-tasks can include designing core conflicts, character settings, outlines and detailed outlines, key story beats, story backgrounds, plot elements, etc., to support the actual writing.  \\n3. For each task, plan a sub-task DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), where the edges represent dependency relationships between design tasks within the same layer of the DAG. Recursively plan each sub-task until all sub-tasks are atomic tasks.\\n\\n# Task Types\\n## Writing (Core, actual writing)\\n- **Function**: Perform actual novel-writing tasks in sequence according to the plan. Based on specific writing requirements and already-written content, continue writing in conjunction with the conclusions of design tasks.  \\n- **All writing tasks are continuation tasks**: Ensure continuity with the preceding content during planning. Writing tasks should flow smoothly and seamlessly with one another.  \\n- **Breakable tasks**: Writing, Design  \\n- Unless necessary, each writing sub-task should be > 500 words.\\n\\n## Design\\n- **Function**: Analyze and design any novel-writing needs other than actual writing. This includes but is not limited to designing core conflicts, character settings, outlines and detailed outlines, key story beats, story backgrounds, plot elements, etc., to support the actual writing.  \\n- **Breakable tasks**: Design  \\n\\n# Information Provided to You\\n- **`Already-written novel content`**: Content from previous writing tasks that has already been written.  \\n- **`Overall plan`**: The overall writing plan, which specifies the task you need to plan through the `is_current_to_plan_task` key.  \\n- **`Results of design tasks completed in higher-level tasks`**  \\n- **`Results of design tasks dependent on the same-layer DAG tasks`**  \\n- **`Writing tasks that require further planning`**  \\n- **`Reference planning`**: A planning sample is provided, which you may cautiously reference.  \\n\\n# Planning Tips\\n1. The last sub-task derived from a writing task must always be a writing task.  \\n2. Reasonably control the number of sub-tasks in each layer of the DAG, generally 3–5 sub-tasks. If the number of tasks exceeds this, aim to plan recursively.  \\n3. **Design tasks** can serve as **sub-tasks of writing tasks**, and as many design sub-tasks as possible should be generated to enhance the quality of writing.  \\n4. Use `dependency` to list the IDs of design tasks within the same-layer DAG. List all potential dependencies as comprehensively as possible.  \\n5. When a design sub-task involves designing specific writing structures (e.g., plot design), subsequent dependent writing tasks should not be laid out flat but should await recursive planning in subsequent rounds.  \\n6. **Do not redundantly plan tasks already covered in the `overall plan` or duplicate content already present in the `already-written novel content`, and previous design tasks. ** \\n7. Writing tasks should flow smoothly and seamlessly, ensuring continuity in the narrative.\\n8. Following the Results of design tasks\\n\\n# Task Attributes\\n1. **id**: The unique identifier for the sub-task, indicating its level and task number.  \\n2. **goal**: A precise and complete description of the sub-task goal in string format.  \\n3. **dependency**: A list of design task IDs from the same-layer DAG that this task depends on. List all potential dependencies as comprehensively as possible. If there are no dependent sub-tasks, this should be empty.  \\n4. **task_type**: A string indicating the type of task. Writing tasks are labeled as `write`, and design tasks are labeled as `think`.  \\n5. **length**: For writing tasks, this attribute specifies the scope, it is required for writing task. Design tasks do not require this attribute.  \\n6. **sub_tasks**: A JSON list representing the sub-task DAG. Each element in the list is a JSON object representing a task.\\n\\n\\n# Example\\n\\n<example index=1>\\nUser-given writing task:\\n{\\n    \\\"id\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n    \\\"task_type\\\": \\\"write\\\",\\n    \\\"goal\\\": \\\"Create an excellent suspense story set in the colony on Europa (Jupiter’s moon), incorporating the real environmental characteristics of Europa.

The latter song was played from tape as an intro to Compliance early into the setlist, replacing The Gallery which was played previously.\\n- The Dark Side's Alternate Reality Instrumental version was also played live for the first time, featuring Matt on slide guitar while sitting on Will the Hacker's shoulder.\\n- Isolated System and Resistance were both played for the first time since 2018. The former song featured all new audio and news excerpts made to match the themes of the Will of the People album.\\n- The Simulation Theory Theme also made its return for the first time since the end of the Simulation Theory World Tour. This time the speech was combined with JFK (marking the latter's first live appearance since 2016), and was used as an interstitial at the start of the encore before Kill or Be Killed.\\n- The Cherub Rock riff was played in a similar fashion to the 2018 and 2019 Chicago gigs, as a tribute to Smashing Pumpkins. Also during the outro of Supermassive Black Hole, Matt played a sped up version of Limp Bizkit's 'Just Like This' riff.\\nProduction and Staging\\n- The staging and production again remained similar to a certain extent to previous legs, but was livened up a bit in various ways.\\n- The stage was similar (but albiet simpler) to the Simulation Theory World Tour. It featured the usual square stage shape with a catwalk to a b-stage, which featured a sinking floor. The stage uniquely featured a transparent floor which allowed light rigs to be placed below the band (it's effect is best seen during We Are Fucking Fucked)\\n- The stage featured the burning \\\"WOTP\\\" sign at the start as before, though following the end of Will of the People the curtain that covered the back of the stage was instead lowered manually rather than being dropped. Said curtain was also plain black rather than patterned.\\n- As before, the band members all wore masks during Will of the People - additionally Dom also wore his during Isolated System and Matt wore his during Behold, The Glove.\\n- The \\\"Will the Hacker\\\" inflatable was once again prominently featured, albeit it was instead revealed during the Kill or Be Killed Felsmann + Tiley remix, rather than during Won't Stand Down like previous shows. Will remained onstage until The Dark Side (Alternate Reality Instrumental), when the back of the stage was covered once again and remained covered until the end of the main set.\\n- At the start of the encore, the curtain was lifted once again to reveal the new, second inflatable; a massive demon-like figure called \\\"Baph\\\". Baph is much taller than Will and additionally featured arms on each side of the stage and an ability to light-up its skeleton and eyes.\\n- Fire cannons were once again prominently used throughout the show, though they were now placed behind the band and on each side of the stage, as opposed to being located along the front of the stage.\\n- The stage also included six overhead LED light structures covered with mirrors, that were able to move up and down and form different shapes above the band during the second half of the show. The structures also have flamethrowers on their backs, which were used during the Uprising solo.\\n- Between We Are Fucking Fucked and The Dark Side, 3 actors came on stage dressed as the band members and wearing the Compliance video masks. They walked to the b-stage before being lowered down and exiting the stage.watch watch\\n- Streamers were released during Compliance, while confetti was released during Verona. Rain confetti was also released during Isolated System.\\nTimetable\\n- 16:30 - Concert club doors [9]\\n- 17:30 - General admission\\n- 18:30 - One Ok Rock\\n- 19:30 - Evanescence\\n- 21:00 - Muse\\nMedia\\nThe official aftermovie can be seen here.\\nSetlist\\n- Will of the People (extended) [watch]\\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Interlude + Hysteria + Cherub Rock\\nriff [watch]\\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Drill Sergeant (robot voice) + Psycho [watch]\\n(Manson Matt Black FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Bliss (extended) [watch]\\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Kill or Be Killed intro + Won't Stand Down [watch]\\n(Manson Oryx, stealth finish Status S2-Classic 5-string) - Kill or Be Killed (Felsmann + Tiley Reinterpretation) [watch]\\n- Compliance [watch]\\n(Manson Chrome FR, satin black Fender Jazz Bass) - Thought Contagion [watch]\\n(Manson Chrome FR, satin black Fender Jazz Bass) - Verona [watch]\\n(Manson MB S-Prototype, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Time Is Running Out [watch]\\n(Manson MB-1 Blue, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Isolated System (shortened) [watch]\\n- Resistance [watch]\\n(Manson MB-1 Blue, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Toccata and Fugue in D Minor intro + You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween [watch]\\n(Manson Chrome FR 2.0, stealth finish Status S2-Classic 5-string) - Madness [watch]\\n(Manson MB-1 Blue, Status Kitara Doubleneck Bass Mk2) - We Are Fucking Fucked [watch]\\n(Manson Matt Black 3.0 #2, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - The Dark Side (Alternate Reality Version) (Instrumental) [watch]\\n(Manson MB S-Prototype) - Supermassive Black Hole w/ Just Like This riff [watch]\\n(Manson M1D1 Stealth, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Plug In Baby (extended) + Sweet Child O' Mine\\nriff [watch]\\n(Manson Mirror 2.0, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Behold, The Glove\\n(aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Uprising (extended) [watch]\\n(Manson Red Alert, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Prelude + Starlight\\n(graphite finish red-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass)Encore\\n- Simulation Theory Theme (shortened)\\n/ JFK + Kill or Be Killed [watch]\\n(Manson Oryx, stealth finish Status S2-Classic 5-string) - Man With a Harmonica + Knights of Cydonia [watch]\\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass)\\nGallery\\nMatt on Will's shoulder during The Dark Side's Alternate Reality Version\\nReferences\\n- ↑ https://twitter.com/...Omiting #784 chars\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"max_tokens\": 8192,\n  \"cache_name\": \"OpenAIApiProxy.call\"\n}"}

The first of two gigs that took place in 2024.\\nInformation\\nAnnounced on April 23rd, 2024, Muse performed at Abu Dhabi's Du Arena/Etihad Park, as part of the Yasalam F1 Post-Race Concerts, on December 8th, 2024. This was Muse's second time performing at the venue and at the event itself, with their first Yasalam post-race concert taking place in 2013.\\nThe Show\\nStaging-wise, the setup remained more or less the same as the festival production from the previous year but with some alterations; the burning \\\"WOTP\\\" sign was not present during the opening song, the flamethrowers were notably smaller than before, and the b-stage truss was much shorter. Will the Hacker was present however and was revealed during Compliance, the same way as during the arena shows of the Will of the People World Tour. Also notably, Matt used his Manson Chrome FR guitar for the majority of the show.\\nWhile the length of the setlist echoed the previous festivals one, there were lots of changes to the order of the songs:\\n- Simulation Theory Theme / JFK opened the show. The final line of the speech was edited (persumably by AI) to say \\\"Women will be what she was born to be\\\" instead of the original line. It was followed by Won't Stand Down which hadn't been played as the first song of a show since May 2022\\n- Resistance, Madness, and Plug in Baby were all played earlier in the show than usual, while Will of the People was played later than usual.\\n- Matt returned to playing the end of Compliance on guitar, something he's not done since January 2023.\\n- Pressure was played for the first time since March 2023.\\n- Hanging in Victory Square (from the Nineteen Eighty-Four score co-composed by Matt) was played live for the first time before Time is Running Out\\n- Behold, The Glove was not played as an intro to Uprising for the first time since October 2022\\n- The main set closed with Knights of Cydonia. Afterwards an unexpected encore was played consisting of Isolated System, Undisclosed Desires and Starlight. Matt wore his LED jacket during the whole encore, and confetti and streamers were released during the last chorus of Starlight.\\nMedia\\nYou can watch individual songs which were fan-recorded with the links below.\\nSetlist\\n- Simulation Theory Theme (shortened)\\n/JFK + Won't Stand Down [watch]\\n(Manson Oryx, satin graphite finish Status Stealth headless 5-string) - Interlude + Hysteria + Back in Black outro\\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Resistance [watch]\\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Drill Sergeant (robot voice) + Psycho\\n(Manson Matt Black FR, woven chrome finish tricolor-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Kill or Be Killed (Felsmann + Tiley Reinterpretation)\\n- Compliance (w/ guitar ending)\\n(Manson Chrome FR, satin black Fender Jazz Bass) - Madness\\n(Manson TronCaster, Status Kitara Doubleneck Bass Mk2) - Thought Contagion\\n(Manson Chrome FR, satin black Fender Jazz Bass) - Pressure\\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Plug In Baby (extended)\\n(Manson Mirror, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Hanging in Victory Square [watch]\\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Time Is Running Out [watch]\\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Will of the People (extended) [watch]\\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Supermassive Black Hole [watch]\\n(Manson M1D1 Stealth, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Toccata and Fugue in D Minor intro + You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween [watch]\\n(Manson Chrome FR 2.0, satin graphite finish Status Stealth headless 5-string) - Uprising (extended)\\n(Manson Fire Red, woven chrome finish tricolor-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Man With a Harmonica + Knights of Cydonia [watch]\\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass)Encore\\n- Isolated System (shortened)\\n- Undisclosed Desires [watch]\\n(graphite finish Status The KingBass Mk-II) - Prelude + Starlight [watch]\\n(graphite finish blue-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass)\\n</content>\\n\\nMake your judgment and output according to the requirements, determining whether the webpage content can fulfill the purpose of this search round\\n\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"max_tokens\": 8192,\n  \"cache_name\": \"OpenAIApiProxy.call\"\n}"}

They debuted the track live this past weekend (March 7) during their slot at the Sips & Sounds festival in Austin, TX.\\nDuring the performance, Halsey is seen sporting a while babydoll style dress with a black curly mullet hairstyle and black cowboy boots. They are seen jumping and running around the massive stage and its catwalk.\\nThe track has nods to artists like Bikini Kill, with Halsey yelling: “Yes, sir, no, sir, on all fours/Are you ready to get what you’ve been waiting for?/I’m not a criminal, I’m just a wild child/I’m not a bad girl, I just like it wild style/I’m tough, I’m mean, I’m rough/Just say the safe word when you’ve had enough,” during the chorus.\\n“I don’t gotta listen to you/ You’re not thе boss of me!”\\nElsewhere in her 18-track setlist, Halsey treated fans to a variety of songs from her discography. Some of the songs they performed included ‘Roman Holiday’, ‘You Should Be Sad’, ‘Ego’, ‘Colors’ and more.\\nHalsey’s Sips & Sounds 2025 setlist was:\\nRecommended\\n‘Bad at Love’ (Decades Remix)\\n‘Panic Attack’ (Extended)\\n‘Roman Holiday’\\n‘Graveyard’\\n‘Hometown’\\n‘You Should Be Sad’\\n‘Ego’\\n‘Closer’ (The Chainsmokers cover) (Rock Remix)\\n‘Colors’ (Rock Remix)\\n‘Lonely is the Muse’\\n‘The Lighthouse’\\n‘You Asked for This’\\n‘Safeword’ (Live debut)\\n‘Gasoline’ (Reimagined)\\n‘Hurricane’\\n‘I am Not a Woman, I’m a God’\\n‘Nightmare’ (Reprise)\\n‘Without Me’\\nLast month, Halsey revealed that she’d be performing some new songs on her 2025 North American ‘For My Last Trick’ tour.\\nIn a five-star review of ‘The Great Impersonator’, NME wrote: “Looking back through her recent catalogue, ‘Manic’ is more stylistically diverse, ‘If I Can’t Have Love, I Want Power’ more musically ambitious, but ‘The Great Impersonator’ is Halsey’s most honest album – that is if you choose to believe her.”\\nThe record also landed at Number 39 on NME‘s 50 best albums of 2024 list, with the single ‘Lonely Is The Muse’ earning a place in our 50 best songs of the year run-down.\\nHalsey’s North American headline tour is due to begin this spring, featuring support from Evanescence, Alvvays and more.

Each character should have a rich background, distinct personality traits, and clear motivations that drive their actions throughout the story. These elements will help to create a compelling narrative that resonates with an adult audience.\n\n1. **Evelyn:**\n   - **Background:** Evelyn is a 32-year-old woman living in a bustling city. She works as an editor for a small publishing house, but she feels trapped in a monotonous routine. Her childhood was filled with stories of magic and adventure, told by her grandmother, which instilled in her a longing for something beyond the ordinary.\n   - **Personality:** Evelyn is introspective, curious, and compassionate. She often finds herself daydreaming and is drawn to the mysterious and unknown. Despite her dissatisfaction with her current life, she is resilient and determined when faced with challenges.\n   - **Motivations:** Evelyn seeks purpose and meaning beyond her mundane existence. The discovery of the ancient book and the promise of a magical world reignite her childhood dreams and drive her to explore the unknown, hoping to find a sense of belonging and fulfillment.\n\n2. **Finn:**\n   - **Background:** Finn is a fae prince from the magical forest. He has lived for centuries, witnessing the ebb and flow of power within the realm. He is caught between his loyalty to his people and the seductive promises of power offered by the Shadow King.\n   - **Personality:** Finn is charming, enigmatic, and conflicted. He possesses a deep sense of duty but is also burdened by a desire for freedom from the constraints of his royal responsibilities. His interactions with Evelyn reveal his vulnerability and capacity for change.\n   - **Motivations:** Initially, Finn is motivated by a desire to protect his realm, even if it means aligning with the Shadow King. However, his growing feelings for Evelyn and her influence challenge his beliefs, ultimately leading him to question his alliances and seek redemption.\n\n3. **The Enchantress:**\n   - **Background:** The Enchantress is an ancient being, a guardian of the magical forest. She has witnessed the rise and fall of many rulers and holds vast knowledge of the realm's secrets. Her past is shrouded in mystery, but she is known for her wisdom and power.\n   - **Personality:** She is wise, enigmatic, and nurturing. The Enchantress exudes a calm authority and is deeply connected to the natural world. She is a mentor figure to Evelyn, guiding her on her journey.\n   - **Motivations:** The Enchantress is driven by a desire to maintain the balance of the magical realm. She seeks to thwart the Shadow King's plans and sees potential in Evelyn to be a catalyst for change, guiding her towards her destiny.\n\n4. **The Shadow King:**\n   - **Background:** The Shadow King is a malevolent force that once ruled the magical realm with an iron fist. Banished to the shadows, he seeks to reclaim his power and plunge the forest into darkness. His origins are tied to the darker aspects of magic, and he thrives on chaos and fear.\n   - **Personality:** He is manipulative, cunning, and ruthless. The Shadow King is a master of deception, using fear and temptation to bend others to his will. He is driven by an insatiable hunger for power and control.\n   - **Motivations:** His primary motivation is to regain control over the magical realm and expand his influence into the human world. He sees Evelyn as both a threat and an opportunity, attempting to sway her to his side to achieve his goals.\n\nBy developing these characters with rich backgrounds, distinct personalities, and clear motivations, we can create a dynamic and engaging story that explores themes of identity, choice, and the struggle between light and darkness.\n</think>\n\n<result>\n**Character Settings for \"The Enchanted Balance\":**\n\n1. **Evelyn:**\n   - **Background:** A 32-year-old editor living in a city, longing for adventure and meaning beyond her mundane life.\n   - **Personality:** Introspective, curious, compassionate, and resilient.\n   - **Motivations:** Seeks purpose and fulfillment, driven by the discovery of a magical world.\n\n2. **Finn:**\n   - **Background:** A fae prince caught between duty and the allure of power, with a history of witnessing the realm's changes.\n   - **Personality:** Charming, enigmatic, and conflicted, with a desire for freedom.\n   - **Motivations:** Initially seeks to protect his realm, but is influenced by his feelings for Evelyn to seek redemption.\n\n3. **The Enchantress:**\n   - **Background:** An ancient guardian of the magical forest, shrouded in mystery and wisdom.\n   - **Personality:** Wise, enigmatic, nurturing, and deeply connected to nature.\n   - **Motivations:** Aims to maintain balance in the realm and sees Evelyn as a catalyst for change.\n\n4. **The Shadow King:**\n   - **Background:** A malevolent force seeking to reclaim power, tied to the darker aspects of magic.\n   - **Personality:** Manipulative, cunning, and ruthless, thriving on chaos and fear.\n   - **Motivations:** Desires to regain control over the magical realm and expand his influence into the human world, viewing Evelyn as both a threat and an opportunity.\n\nThese character settings provide a foundation for a rich narrative that explores complex themes and engages an adult audience. \n</result>", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "add_time": "2025-03-14_17:31:16", "hint": "{\n  \"model\": \"gpt-4o\",\n  \"messages\": [\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"The collaborative story-writing requirement to be completed: **Write a fairy story for adult.

The first of two gigs that took place in 2024.\\nInformation\\nAnnounced on April 23rd, 2024, Muse performed at Abu Dhabi's Du Arena/Etihad Park, as part of the Yasalam F1 Post-Race Concerts, on December 8th, 2024. This was Muse's second time performing at the venue and at the event itself, with their first Yasalam post-race concert taking place in 2013.\\nThe Show\\nStaging-wise, the setup remained more or less the same as the festival production from the previous year but with some alterations; the burning \\\"WOTP\\\" sign was not present during the opening song, the flamethrowers were notably smaller than before, and the b-stage truss was much shorter. Will the Hacker was present however and was revealed during Compliance, the same way as during the arena shows of the Will of the People World Tour. Also notably, Matt used his Manson Chrome FR guitar for the majority of the show.\\nWhile the length of the setlist echoed the previous festivals one, there were lots of changes to the order of the songs:\\n- Simulation Theory Theme / JFK opened the show. The final line of the speech was edited (persumably by AI) to say \\\"Women will be what she was born to be\\\" instead of the original line. It was followed by Won't Stand Down which hadn't been played as the first song of a show since May 2022\\n- Resistance, Madness, and Plug in Baby were all played earlier in the show than usual, while Will of the People was played later than usual.\\n- Matt returned to playing the end of Compliance on guitar, something he's not done since January 2023.\\n- Pressure was played for the first time since March 2023.\\n- Hanging in Victory Square (from the Nineteen Eighty-Four score co-composed by Matt) was played live for the first time before Time is Running Out\\n- Behold, The Glove was not played as an intro to Uprising for the first time since October 2022\\n- The main set closed with Knights of Cydonia. Afterwards an unexpected encore was played consisting of Isolated System, Undisclosed Desires and Starlight. Matt wore his LED jacket during the whole encore, and confetti and streamers were released during the last chorus of Starlight.\\nMedia\\nYou can watch individual songs which were fan-recorded with the links below.\\nSetlist\\n- Simulation Theory Theme (shortened)\\n/JFK + Won't Stand Down [watch]\\n(Manson Oryx, satin graphite finish Status Stealth headless 5-string) - Interlude + Hysteria + Back in Black outro\\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Resistance [watch]\\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Drill Sergeant (robot voice) + Psycho\\n(Manson Matt Black FR, woven chrome finish tricolor-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Kill or Be Killed (Felsmann + Tiley Reinterpretation)\\n- Compliance (w/ guitar ending)\\n(Manson Chrome FR, satin black Fender Jazz Bass) - Madness\\n(Manson TronCaster, Status Kitara Doubleneck Bass Mk2) - Thought Contagion\\n(Manson Chrome FR, satin black Fender Jazz Bass) - Pressure\\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Plug In Baby (extended)\\n(Manson Mirror, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Hanging in Victory Square [watch]\\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Time Is Running Out [watch]\\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Will of the People (extended) [watch]\\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Supermassive Black Hole [watch]\\n(Manson M1D1 Stealth, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Toccata and Fugue in D Minor intro + You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween [watch]\\n(Manson Chrome FR 2.0, satin graphite finish Status Stealth headless 5-string) - Uprising (extended)\\n(Manson Fire Red, woven chrome finish tricolor-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Man With a Harmonica + Knights of Cydonia [watch]\\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass)Encore\\n- Isolated System (shortened)\\n- Undisclosed Desires [watch]\\n(graphite finish Status The KingBass Mk-II) - Prelude + Starlight [watch]\\n(graphite finish blue-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass)\\n</content>\\n\\nOrganize and extract as required, focusing solely on the webpage content itself.

The latter song was played from tape as an intro to Compliance early into the setlist, replacing The Gallery which was played previously.\\n- The Dark Side's Alternate Reality Instrumental version was also played live for the first time, featuring Matt on slide guitar while sitting on Will the Hacker's shoulder.\\n- Isolated System and Resistance were both played for the first time since 2018. The former song featured all new audio and news excerpts made to match the themes of the Will of the People album.\\n- The Simulation Theory Theme also made its return for the first time since the end of the Simulation Theory World Tour. This time the speech was combined with JFK (marking the latter's first live appearance since 2016), and was used as an interstitial at the start of the encore before Kill or Be Killed.\\n- The Cherub Rock riff was played in a similar fashion to the 2018 and 2019 Chicago gigs, as a tribute to Smashing Pumpkins. Also during the outro of Supermassive Black Hole, Matt played a sped up version of Limp Bizkit's 'Just Like This' riff.\\nProduction and Staging\\n- The staging and production again remained similar to a certain extent to previous legs, but was livened up a bit in various ways.\\n- The stage was similar (but albiet simpler) to the Simulation Theory World Tour. It featured the usual square stage shape with a catwalk to a b-stage, which featured a sinking floor. The stage uniquely featured a transparent floor which allowed light rigs to be placed below the band (it's effect is best seen during We Are Fucking Fucked)\\n- The stage featured the burning \\\"WOTP\\\" sign at the start as before, though following the end of Will of the People the curtain that covered the back of the stage was instead lowered manually rather than being dropped. Said curtain was also plain black rather than patterned.\\n- As before, the band members all wore masks during Will of the People - additionally Dom also wore his during Isolated System and Matt wore his during Behold, The Glove.\\n- The \\\"Will the Hacker\\\" inflatable was once again prominently featured, albeit it was instead revealed during the Kill or Be Killed Felsmann + Tiley remix, rather than during Won't Stand Down like previous shows. Will remained onstage until The Dark Side (Alternate Reality Instrumental), when the back of the stage was covered once again and remained covered until the end of the main set.\\n- At the start of the encore, the curtain was lifted once again to reveal the new, second inflatable; a massive demon-like figure called \\\"Baph\\\". Baph is much taller than Will and additionally featured arms on each side of the stage and an ability to light-up its skeleton and eyes.\\n- Fire cannons were once again prominently used throughout the show, though they were now placed behind the band and on each side of the stage, as opposed to being located along the front of the stage.\\n- The stage also included six overhead LED light structures covered with mirrors, that were able to move up and down and form different shapes above the band during the second half of the show. The structures also have flamethrowers on their backs, which were used during the Uprising solo.\\n- Between We Are Fucking Fucked and The Dark Side, 3 actors came on stage dressed as the band members and wearing the Compliance video masks. They walked to the b-stage before being lowered down and exiting the stage.watch watch\\n- Streamers were released during Compliance, while confetti was released during Verona. Rain confetti was also released during Isolated System.\\nTimetable\\n- 16:30 - Concert club doors [9]\\n- 17:30 - General admission\\n- 18:30 - One Ok Rock\\n- 19:30 - Evanescence\\n- 21:00 - Muse\\nMedia\\nThe official aftermovie can be seen here.\\nSetlist\\n- Will of the People (extended) [watch]\\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Interlude + Hysteria + Cherub Rock\\nriff [watch]\\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Drill Sergeant (robot voice) + Psycho [watch]\\n(Manson Matt Black FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Bliss (extended) [watch]\\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Kill or Be Killed intro + Won't Stand Down [watch]\\n(Manson Oryx, stealth finish Status S2-Classic 5-string) - Kill or Be Killed (Felsmann + Tiley Reinterpretation) [watch]\\n- Compliance [watch]\\n(Manson Chrome FR, satin black Fender Jazz Bass) - Thought Contagion [watch]\\n(Manson Chrome FR, satin black Fender Jazz Bass) - Verona [watch]\\n(Manson MB S-Prototype, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Time Is Running Out [watch]\\n(Manson MB-1 Blue, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Isolated System (shortened) [watch]\\n- Resistance [watch]\\n(Manson MB-1 Blue, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Toccata and Fugue in D Minor intro + You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween [watch]\\n(Manson Chrome FR 2.0, stealth finish Status S2-Classic 5-string) - Madness [watch]\\n(Manson MB-1 Blue, Status Kitara Doubleneck Bass Mk2) - We Are Fucking Fucked [watch]\\n(Manson Matt Black 3.0 #2, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - The Dark Side (Alternate Reality Version) (Instrumental) [watch]\\n(Manson MB S-Prototype) - Supermassive Black Hole w/ Just Like This riff [watch]\\n(Manson M1D1 Stealth, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Plug In Baby (extended) + Sweet Child O' Mine\\nriff [watch]\\n(Manson Mirror 2.0, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Behold, The Glove\\n(aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Uprising (extended) [watch]\\n(Manson Red Alert, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Prelude + Starlight\\n(graphite finish red-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass)Encore\\n- Simulation Theory Theme (shortened)\\n/ JFK + Kill or Be Killed [watch]\\n(Manson Oryx, stealth finish Status S2-Classic 5-string) - Man With a Harmonica + Knights of Cydonia [watch]\\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass)\\nGallery\\nMatt on Will's shoulder during The Dark Side's Alternate Reality Version\\nReferences\\n- ↑ https://twitter.com/muse/status/1575485906123104258/photo/1\\n- ↑ https://twitter.com/muse/status/1575485906123104258/photo/1\\n- ↑ https://twitter.com/muse/status/1575485906123104258/photo/1\\n- ↑ https://twitter.com/muse/status/1590403848077803520/photo/1\\n- ↑ https://www.reddit.com/r/Muse/comments/11arlmb/us_tour_starts_tomorrow/\\n- ↑ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Center\\n- ↑ https://www.ticketmaster.com/muse-will-of-the-people-tour-chicago-illinois-02-25-2023/event/04005D3315B43BD4\\n- ↑ https://www.reddit.com/r/Muse/comments/11arlmb/us_tour_starts_tomorrow/\\n- ↑ https://www.unitedcenter.com/events/2023/02/25/muse-will-of-the-people-tour/\\n</content>\\n\\nOrganize and extract as required, focusing solely on the webpage content itself.

{"key": "e838ee1919568f4286085fc9ec4e7438", "value": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "<think>\nTo design the setting for \"The Enchanted Balance,\" we need to consider the time, place, and magical elements that will enrich the story and align with the existing plot and character settings. The setting should evoke a sense of wonder and mystery while being suitable for an adult audience. \n\n**Time:**\nThe story will take place in a contemporary setting, juxtaposing the mundane modern world with a timeless, magical realm. This contrast will highlight Evelyn's journey from her ordinary life to an extraordinary adventure. The magical realm exists outside of the conventional flow of time, allowing for a fluid and dreamlike experience.\n\n**Place:**\n1. **The Human World:**\n   - A bustling city where Evelyn resides, characterized by its gray, monotonous atmosphere. This setting reflects Evelyn's initial feelings of disillusionment and her yearning for something more.\n   - Key locations include Evelyn's apartment, filled with books and artifacts hinting at her desire for adventure, and a quaint, hidden bookstore where she discovers the ancient book that leads her to the magical realm.\n\n2. **The Magical Forest:**\n   - A lush, vibrant forest that serves as the gateway to the magical realm. It is alive with color and energy, contrasting sharply with the human world.\n   - The forest is inhabited by various magical creatures and is governed by natural laws that differ from those of the human world. It is a place of beauty and danger, where the boundaries between reality and fantasy blur.\n\n**Magical Elements:**\n1. **Portal to the Magical Realm:**\n   - The portal is a mystical gateway hidden within the forest, accessible only to those who possess the ancient book. It is a shimmering veil of light that transports Evelyn to the magical realm.\n\n2. **The Enchantress's Domain:**\n   - A secluded sanctuary within the forest, where the Enchantress resides. It is a place of tranquility and wisdom, filled with ancient trees, glowing flora, and a serene lake that reflects the stars even in daylight.\n\n3. **The Shadow King's Lair:**\n   - A dark, foreboding castle hidden deep within the forest, shrouded in shadows and mist. It is a place of fear and power, where the Shadow King plots his return to dominance.\n\n4. **Magical Flora and Fauna:**\n   - The forest is home to enchanted plants and creatures, each with unique properties and abilities. These elements add depth and intrigue to the setting, offering both aid and obstacles to Evelyn on her journey.\n\n5. **The Balance of Magic:**\n   - The realm is governed by a delicate balance of light and darkness, maintained by the Enchantress. Magic flows through the land, influencing the environment and its inhabitants. The Shadow King's influence threatens this balance, creating tension and conflict within the story.\n\nBy weaving these elements together, the setting of \"The Enchanted Balance\" will provide a rich backdrop for the narrative, enhancing the themes of identity, purpose, and the struggle between light and darkness. This setting will captivate an adult audience with its complexity and depth, inviting them to explore a world where magic and reality intertwine.\n</think>\n\n<result>\n**Setting Design for \"The Enchanted Balance\":**\n\n1. **Time:**\n   - Contemporary setting in the human world, contrasting with a timeless magical realm.\n\n2. **Place:**\n   - **The Human World:**\n     - A bustling city where Evelyn lives, characterized by monotony and grayness.\n     - Key locations: Evelyn's book-filled apartment and a hidden bookstore.\n\n   - **The Magical Forest:**\n     - A vibrant, enchanted forest serving as the gateway to the magical realm.\n     - Inhabited by magical creatures and governed by unique natural laws.\n\n3. **Magical Elements:**\n   - **Portal to the Magical Realm:**\n     - A mystical gateway hidden within the forest, accessible through an ancient book.\n\n   - **The Enchantress's Domain:**\n     - A tranquil sanctuary filled with ancient trees, glowing flora, and a serene lake.\n\n   - **The Shadow King's Lair:**\n     - A dark castle shrouded in shadows and mist, symbolizing fear and power.\n\n   - **Magical Flora and Fauna:**\n     - Enchanted plants and creatures with unique properties, adding depth and intrigue.\n\n   - **The Balance of Magic:**\n     - The realm's delicate balance of light and darkness, threatened by the Shadow King.\n\nThis setting provides a rich and immersive backdrop for the story, enhancing the narrative's themes and engaging an adult audience with its complexity and depth.\n</result>", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "add_time": "2025-03-14_17:31:43", "hint": "{\n  \"model\": \"gpt-4o\",\n  \"messages\": [\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"The collaborative story-writing requirement to be completed: **Write a fairy story for adult.

{"key": "634dd3b3eff559fffccb31e02fb11643", "value": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "<think>\nTo effectively design the core elements of \"The Enchanted Balance,\" we begin by examining the components provided: plot, characters, and setting. Our goal is to synthesize these elements into a cohesive narrative, ensuring all parts are logically consistent and contribute to a compelling story.\n\n### Plot\nThe proposed plot structure outlines key narrative beats, including Evelyn's discovery, the conflict with the Shadow King, and the resolution. I will ensure these events connect seamlessly and amplify the story's themes. One area to strengthen is the transition from Evelyn’s initial disillusionment to her involvement in the magical realm. Adding more depth to her motivations could enhance her journey's emotional impact. Also, refining the climax and concluding portions can better underscore the themes of identity and choice.\n\n### Characters\nEach character has been sketched with distinct backgrounds, personalities, and motivations, which provide a solid foundation. There could be more focus on developing the complexity of their relationships, particularly between Evelyn and Finn, whose alliance shift is crucial. Moreover, integrating more depth into the Shadow King and the Enchantress' roles can enrich the storyline, especially in demonstrating the intricacies of power and redemption.\n\n### Setting\nThe contrast between the mundane human world and the vibrant magical realm supports the narrative's thematic exploration. However, details about the portal mechanics and how the magical properties reflect the story’s struggles could be further developed. Enhancing the magical realm's description will create a more immersive reading experience and support the story's tone and mood.\n\n### Integration and Refinement\nThe integration process will ensure that characters’ decisions naturally lead to the story's outcomes, reinforcing the themes of identity and the complexity of choice. Refinement efforts will focus on maintaining pacing and maintaining a consistent tone throughout the story, which strikes a balance between wonder and mature themes. Innovations should enhance originality, avoiding fantasy clichés while encouraging profound thematic exploration.\n\n**Key Points for Enhancement and Innovation:**\n1. Deepen Evelyn's emotional arc, clarifying what she learns about herself.\n2. Elaborate on the Enchantress and Shadow King's backstories to add narrative tension.\n3. Make the magical elements symbolic of inner conflicts and choices.\n4. Illustrate the resolution's impact on both realms, enhancing the sense of closure and transformation.\n\nThese considerations will aid in constructing a balanced, engaging, and richly layered narrative suitable for a fairy tale aimed at adults.\n</think>\n\n<result>\n**Story Design for \"The Enchanted Balance\":**\n\n**Title:** The Enchanted Balance\n\n**Plot Structure:**\n\n1. **Introduction:**\n   - Evelyn, a 32-year-old editor stuck in the monotony of city life, yearns for adventure and discovers an ancient book hinting at a magical forest. Her need for meaning propels her to seek the portal to this mystical realm.\n\n2. **Rising Action:**\n   - In the forest, Evelyn meets Finn, a conflicted fae prince. Finn tells her about the Shadow King's threat and the importance of maintaining balance.

Torn between her feelings for him and her growing connection to the Enchantress and the forest, Evelyn's struggle embodies the theme of choice.\n\n4. **Falling Action:**\n   - Evelyn and the Enchantress prepare to confront the Shadow King. Redemption becomes key as Finn decides to betray the Shadow King and help Evelyn restore balance.\n\n5. **Resolution:**\n   - After defeating the Shadow King, balance is restored. Evelyn, now empowered and with a renewed purpose, leaves the realm behind. In the human world, she embraces her life with fresh perspective and intent.\n\n**Character Settings:**\n\n1. **Evelyn:**\n   - **Background:** Disillusioned with modern life; seeks excitement and purpose.\n   - **Personality:** Curious, determined, empathetic, evolving from introspection to action.\n   - **Motivations:** Searching for deeper meaning and a sense of belonging.\n\n2. **Finn:**\n   - **Background:** A fae prince, burdened by realm politics and personal freedom struggles.\n   - **Personality:** Enigmatic, charming, but secretly torn.\n   - **Motivations:** Protect his realm while battling inner desires and love for Evelyn.\n\n3. **The Enchantress:**\n   - **Background:** Mysterious guardian of balance; ancient even by fae standards.\n   - **Personality:** Nurturing, wise, yet secretive.\n   - **Motivations:** Ready to restore balance using Evelyn as a key figure.\n\n4. **The Shadow King:**\n   - **Background:** Dark remnant of past magic, craving control.\n   - **Personality:** Manipulative, ruthless, charming in malevolence.\n   - **Motivations:** Reclaim power and extend his realm of influence into the human world.\n\n**Setting Design:**\n\n1. **Time:**\n   - Contemporary era, introducing a timeless contrast with the magical realm.\n\n2. **Place:**\n   - **The Human World:** Characterized by routine urban stagnation. Evelyn’s life and the hidden bookstore are key locations.\n   - **The Magical Forest:** Lush, perpetually dynamic, governed by magic’s natural laws.\n   - **Enchantress Domain and Shadow King's Lair:** Contrasting sanctuaries of tranquility and malevolent power.\n\n3. **Magical Elements:**\n   - **Portal:** A hidden nexus, symbolizing Evelyn’s transition.\n   - **Natural Laws:** Symbolic flora/fauna reflecting internal/external conflicts.\n   - **Balance Mechanism:** Intricately tied to both realms' fate.\n\nThis refined design aligns narrative elements into an immersive story that captivates an adult audience through its rich themes of identity, choice, and transformation.\n</result>", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "add_time": "2025-03-14_17:32:16", "hint": "{\n  \"model\": \"gpt-4o\",\n  \"messages\": [\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"The collaborative story-writing requirement to be completed: **Write a fairy story for adult.

The show was short but a very good one! The singer, Ricky Wilson, is very charismatic and an excellent dancer!\\nAbout Muse - Tour Simulation Theory:\\nthe sound was very good, the instruments were heard in good frequency and also the voices.\\nThe band has a strong connection on stage and a great dynamic between them.\\nThe setlist was very well chosen, mixing successful songs from previous albums, like Hysteria, Supermassive and Starlight; and new album hits like: Algorithm, Propaganda and Thought Contagion.\\nThe songs were similar to other shows that they played on this tour in all Latin America, but they surprised Santiago with the song Bliss (not in other setlists).\\nLead singer Matt sings very well live can make different tones of voice, is incredible, just like the albums!\\nIn addition, the lighting games and dancers who were on the stage during the show further contributed to the whole presentation.\\nThe show finished with Knights of Cydonia and made everyone very happy!\\nA great night! Thank you Muse!\\nThis was the 3rd concert I have seen Muse at. I have to say as far as concerts go, you won't find one with any more to it than a Muse concert. I have been to many concerts and I love them all. Music made in a studio is never going to capture the real live sound. Music is made to be played live!\\nThe Simulation tour was simply amazing. Visually, audibly and just being there. Having trombones being played, actually played not recorded and being a part of the opening was simply astonishing. It as a great sound and visually it was amazing. The same with Pressure, having the trombones out there added to the song and made it unbelievable.\\nThey also played Dig Down the acoustic gospel version live. With Dom, Matt and Chris playing center of the stadium. Chris on the acoustic guitar, Matt on the piano and Dom obviously on the drums. What a neat set to see them playing so close together and the gospel signers on stage lit up by their costumes. Very well done!\\nOur son didn't(teenager) didn't understand the Close Encounters of the 3rd kind part. Where Matt was playing the guitar and the mother ship was responding. He is too young. :-) My wife and I got it.\\nWatching Matt play his guitar by his tong! What? I had never seen anything like it. He is amazing. Chris is just amazing on bass and Dom on drums. These guys can do it all!\\nWhat a fun show. I really appreciate what Muse has done to give back to their fan's. Too many bands don't care as long as they sell their tickets. Muse doesn't appear to be like that. Even purchasing tickets, they allow the true fans to purchase first getting the best seats.\\nI look forward to seeing them again! Great show, great music, and a great time. Playing for almost 2 hours. Great job Muse!\\nThere is a reason these guys play in big arenas. It’s not just a few guys on a stage playing their music, it’s a production. Even up in the nosebleeds it was a great show.\\nSpoiler alert! Don’t read any further if you don’t want to know.\\nHad it all! Glowing glasses, lit up suits, giant robots, a piano that shoots lasers, dancers with flashlights, smoke machines and glowing batons, and a special appearance by Eddie! People hanging from wires, surprises coming up from trap doors, lasers, lasers and more lasers! The set was a blistering 26 songs lasting a little over two hours!\\nI will definitely see them again the next time they come to town. Though not from the balcony. They say “Don’t look down if you have a thing about heights.” That’s where the stage is!\\nGreat show.\\n</content>\\n\\nMake your judgment and output according to the requirements, determining whether the webpage content can fulfill the purpose of this search round\\n\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"max_tokens\": 8192,\n  \"cache_name\": \"OpenAIApiProxy.call\"\n}"}

Find Muse tour …\\nContent: 10/10\\nby naze on 5/22/24Rating: 5 out of 5cool show! would definitely go back and watch everything again\\nThere are no upcoming concerts in United States\\nDon't worry, there are other concerts available below\\nMuse in Concert\\nArmed with guitars, synths, and one killer falsetto, British rockers Muse have been playing and performing like it's the end of the world since the mid-1990s. The trio of lead vocalist and guitarist Matt Bellamy, bassist Chris Wolstenholme, and drummer Dominic Howard first came together in Devon, England, as goth band Rocket Baby Dolls. At the time, their riveting showmanship on stage was already starting to show: In 1994, they won a local \\\"battle of the bands\\\" contest, switched their name to the trimmer and tidier Muse, and have since skyrocketed into one of the most electrifying stadium acts in the world.\\nOver their first few years, they played gigs around England and eventually recorded their first set of material, a self-titled EP, in 1998. But it wasn't until follow-up EP ‘Muscle Museum' that they first reached the NME Indie Singles Chart, and started accumulating comparisons to Radiohead. Their 1999 debut album ‘Showbiz' would follow, and its sci-fi-inspired alt-rock landed them on numerous European charts. Muse's bombastic eclecticism would only grow from here. Their next round of albums incorporated more touches of classical music, church organs, Mellotrons, and various experimental effects, and by their third album, ‘Absolution,' they'd kicked off a consistent streak of topping the U.K. charts.\\nSince 2006's ‘Black Holes and Revelations,' they began to conquer the U.S. as well, and their live shows became more and more extravagant as their music became more and more dystopic. The high-tech worldwide tours backing 2009's ‘1984'-inspired ‘The Resistance' and 2012's ‘The Second Law' would prove them to be a must-see event, with massive light displays and film projections, pyrotechnics, and even an LED suit for Bellamy. Their next album, ‘Drones,' scored them a Grammy Award for Best Rock Album in 2015, and gave them a good reason to incorporate real drones into their Drones Tour. Muse would continue on the surreal sci-fi path with 2018's synth-pop release ‘Simulation Theory' and a 2019 tour — quite possibly their most mind-blowing yet.\\nEncore\\nEncore\\nEncore\\nEncore\\ncool show! would definitely go back and watch everything again\\nMuse's concert was INSANE! The visuals, the sound, the energy – it was all off the charts. An absolute rock revolution that blew my mind! 🤩🎤🎶\\nI’ve seen Muse in concert around 7 times, and they kill it every time! They’re amazing performers and they sound outrageous, Live! Every time they’re in N.Y, I make sure to go see them! Love them :-)\\nAbsolutely amazing. They killed it. They really go all out. Definitely want to see them again.\\nThis was more than a concert, it was full-on performance, explosive and energetic, memorable and impactful. Seamless stream of music and lights and confetti and fire. I'm generally too shy to be very vocal in social settings like this, but I had no voice after this concert as I couldn't help but join in the singing and screaming with excitement. How cool to have that experience in a room full of thousands of other fans all collectively vibing with the band together. It was so amazing, I want to do it again!\\nThis is the first time I have seen Muse. Absolutely, phenomenal performance. Great sound. Great light show. Everything. Solid.\\nIt was an amazing show with a great line up, Highly Suspect and Evanescence were amazing. Muse went over the top (in a great way), If was more than just preforming music, they created a whole show to go with their music. I would see them again.\\nMuse is one of the best bands, a new experience of Rock, very unique style, sound, lyrics, everything! Best of the best!!!\\nI’m always be in love with their rock style and the way Matthew is singing and April was my lucky month which could see them in concert . It’s ridiculous how good they are..They were brilliant and full of energy. Their performance absolutely awesome they are one of the best rock band🏻\\nMy inner high school emo self was SO happy!! The girl next to me and I were in happy tears at some point reliving our high school emo days.

Sign up for event updates.\\nAbout Muse Tickets\\nThe English rock band, Muse, was formed in 1994 after a few friends won a local battle of the band's competition. After playing gigs around London and Manchester, Muse released their debut album, Showbiz, in 1999. Over the next few years, the group experimented with instruments such as the church organ, animal bones and an expanded drum kit, giving their next album a classical yet romantic influence. In 2001, the group released their sophomore album, Origins of Symmetry, which showcased their newly developed melancholic sound. Muse had their big break after releasing their third album, Absolution, which debuted at No. 1 in the UK and produced their first top ten hit, ‘Time is Running Out. ’ Following this success, they released their third album, Black Holes and Revelations, which incorporated electronic and pop elements. Muse is known for their lyrical albums, all of which are inspired by introspective themes, books and global issues. Each album represents a different concept, such as relationships, science fiction and drone warfare. Muses’ ability to create a cohesive sound while blending many different styles is nothing short of impressive, making it no surprise that they have won multiple Grammys and sold millions of albums worldwide.\\nHow much are Muse tickets?\\nThere are no upcoming events for Muse.

Stay updated …\\nContent: Muse\\nMuse tour dates: 5 concerts in 5 countries\\nAbout Muse\\nMuse are an English rock band from Teignmouth, Devon, formed in 1994. The band consists of Matt Bellamy (lead vocals, guitar, piano, keyboards), Chris Wolstenholme (bass guitar, backing vocals, keyboards) and Dominic Howard (drums, percussion).\\nMuse released their debut album, Showbiz, in 1999, showcasing Bellamy's falsetto and a melancholic alternative rock style. Their second album, Origin of Symmetry (2001), expanded their sound, incorporating wider instrumentation and romantic classical influences, and earned them a reputation for energetic live performances. Absolution (2003) saw further classical influence, with orchestra on tracks such as \\\"Butterflies and Hurricanes\\\", and became the first of five consecutive UK number-one albums.\\nBlack Holes and Revelations (2006) incorporated electronic and pop elements, influenced by 1980s groups such as Depeche Mode, displayed in singles such as \\\"Supermassive Black Hole\\\". The album brought Muse wider international success. The Resistance (2009) and The 2nd Law (2012) explored themes of government oppression and civil uprising and cemented Muse as one of the world's major stadium acts. Their seventh album, Drones (2015), was a concept album about drone warfare and returned to a harder rock sound.\\nMuse have won numerous awards, including two Grammy Awards, winning the Grammys for Best Rock Album for The Resistance and Drones, two Brit Awards, winning Best British Live Act twice, five MTV Europe Music Awards and eight NME Awards. They have sold over 20 million albums worldwide.\\n</content>\\n\\nMake your judgment and output according to the requirements, determining whether the webpage content can fulfill the purpose of this search round\\n\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"max_tokens\": 8192,\n  \"cache_name\": \"OpenAIApiProxy.call\"\n}"}

The conflict should be deeply intertwined with the themes of identity, choice, balance, and redemption, while the resolution should provide a satisfying conclusion that reflects the themes of hope and empowerment.\n\n**Conflict Design:**\n\n1. **Internal Conflict (Evelyn):** Evelyn's internal struggle is central to the story. She is torn between her mundane life in the human world and the allure of the magical realm. Her journey is one of self-discovery, where she must confront her fears and insecurities to find her true purpose. This internal conflict is heightened by her feelings for Finn and the realization that her choices have significant consequences.\n\n2. **External Conflict (Finn and the Shadow King):** The external conflict revolves around the threat posed by the Shadow King, who seeks to disrupt the balance between the realms. Finn's alliance with the Shadow King adds complexity to the conflict, as his internal battle between duty and temptation mirrors Evelyn's struggle. The Shadow King represents the embodiment of imbalance and chaos, threatening both the magical and human worlds.\n\n3. **Relational Conflict (Evelyn and Finn):** The relationship between Evelyn and Finn is fraught with tension due to Finn's initial deception and alliance with the Shadow King. Evelyn's trust in Finn is shaken, and she must decide whether to forgive him and believe in his redemption. This relational conflict is crucial for character development and adds emotional depth to the narrative.\n\n**Resolution Design:**\n\n1. **Climactic Confrontation:** The resolution begins with a climactic confrontation between Evelyn, Finn, the Enchantress, and the Shadow King. Evelyn's growth and newfound confidence empower her to take a stand against the Shadow King, using her unique connection to both worlds to tip the scales in their favor.\n\n2. **Finn's Redemption:** Finn's decision to betray the Shadow King and aid Evelyn is a pivotal moment. His redemption arc is completed as he chooses love and duty over power and temptation. This act of selflessness helps restore balance and reinforces the theme of forgiveness.\n\n3. **Restoration of Balance:** With the Shadow King's defeat, the balance between the realms is restored. The magical forest begins to heal, symbolizing the harmony achieved through Evelyn and Finn's actions. The Enchantress acknowledges Evelyn's role in saving the realm, offering her a choice to stay or return to the human world.\n\n4. **Evelyn's Empowerment:** Evelyn chooses to return to the human world, empowered by her experiences and with a renewed sense of purpose. She embraces her life with a fresh perspective, ready to make meaningful choices and seek balance in her own world.\n\n5. **Hopeful Conclusion:** The story concludes on a hopeful note, with Evelyn's transformation serving as an inspiration for readers to embrace change and seek their own balance. The magical realm remains a part of her, symbolizing the enduring impact of her journey.\n\nBy weaving together these elements, the conflict and resolution provide a compelling narrative arc that resonates with the themes of the story and offers a satisfying conclusion for an adult audience.\n</think>\n\n<result>\n**Conflict and Resolution Design for \"The Enchanted Balance\":**\n\n**Conflict:**\n\n1. **Internal Conflict (Evelyn):**\n   - Evelyn struggles with her identity and purpose, torn between her mundane life and the magical realm.\n   - Her feelings for Finn and the weight of her choices intensify her internal conflict.\n\n2. **External Conflict (Finn and the Shadow King):**\n   - The Shadow King threatens the balance between realms, seeking power and chaos.\n   - Finn's alliance with the Shadow King complicates the conflict, reflecting his internal struggle.\n\n3. **Relational Conflict (Evelyn and Finn):**\n   - Evelyn's trust in Finn is tested by his initial deception.\n   - Their relationship is central to the narrative, adding emotional depth and tension.\n\n**Resolution:**\n\n1. **Climactic Confrontation:**\n   - Evelyn, Finn, and the Enchantress confront the Shadow King.\n   - Evelyn's growth empowers her to stand against the Shadow King, using her unique connection to both worlds.\n\n2. **Finn's Redemption:**\n   - Finn betrays the Shadow King, choosing love and duty over power.\n   - His redemption reinforces themes of forgiveness and transformation.\n\n3. **Restoration of Balance:**\n   - The Shadow King's defeat restores balance, healing the magical forest.\n   - The Enchantress acknowledges Evelyn's role, offering her a choice to stay or return.\n\n4. **Evelyn's Empowerment:**\n   - Evelyn returns to the human world, empowered and with a renewed sense of purpose.\n   - She embraces life with a fresh perspective, ready to seek balance and make meaningful choices.\n\n5. **Hopeful Conclusion:**\n   - The story ends on a hopeful note, inspiring readers to embrace change and seek their own balance.\n   - The magical realm remains a part of Evelyn, symbolizing the enduring impact of her journey.\n\nThis conflict and resolution design ensures a compelling narrative arc that aligns with the story's themes and provides a satisfying conclusion for an adult audience.\n</result>", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "add_time": "2025-03-14_17:33:12", "hint": "{\n  \"model\": \"gpt-4o\",\n  \"messages\": [\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"The collaborative story-writing requirement to be completed: **Write a fairy story for adult.

Therefore, the goal does not need any updates as it is already aligned with the demands and is detailed enough.\n\nAccording to the atomic task determination rules, the task involves writing a complete story of 1000 words, which is slightly above the threshold for a short piece of writing (500 words or less). However, given the complexity of integrating multiple design elements into a cohesive narrative, it may require further planning to ensure all elements are effectively woven together.

The show was short but a very good one! The singer, Ricky Wilson, is very charismatic and an excellent dancer!\\nAbout Muse - Tour Simulation Theory:\\nthe sound was very good, the instruments were heard in good frequency and also the voices.\\nThe band has a strong connection on stage and a great dynamic between them.\\nThe setlist was very well chosen, mixing successful songs from previous albums, like Hysteria, Supermassive and Starlight; and new album hits like: Algorithm, Propaganda and Thought Contagion.\\nThe songs were similar to other shows that they played on this tour in all Latin America, but they surprised Santiago with the song Bliss (not in other setlists).\\nLead singer Matt sings very well live can make different tones of voice, is incredible, just like the albums!\\nIn addition, the lighting games and dancers who were on the stage during the show further contributed to the whole presentation.\\nThe show finished with Knights of Cydonia and made everyone very happy!\\nA great night! Thank you Muse!\\nThis was the 3rd concert I have seen Muse at. I have to say as far as concerts go, you won't find one with any more to it than a Muse concert. I have been to many concerts and I love them all. Music made in a studio is never going to capture the real live sound. Music is made to be played live!\\nThe Simulation tour was simply amazing. Visually, audibly and just being there. Having trombones being played, actually played not recorded and being a part of the opening was simply astonishing. It as a great sound and visually it was amazing. The same with Pressure, having the trombones out there added to the song and made it unbelievable.\\nThey also played Dig Down the acoustic gospel version live. With Dom, Matt and Chris playing center of the stadium. Chris on the acoustic guitar, Matt on the piano and Dom obviously on the drums. What a neat set to see them playing so close together and the gospel signers on stage lit up by their costumes. Very well done!\\nOur son didn't(teenager) didn't understand the Close Encounters of the 3rd kind part. Where Matt was playing the guitar and the mother ship was responding. He is too young. :-) My wife and I got it.\\nWatching Matt play his guitar by his tong! What? I had never seen anything like it. He is amazing. Chris is just amazing on bass and Dom on drums. These guys can do it all!\\nWhat a fun show. I really appreciate what Muse has done to give back to their fan's. Too many bands don't care as long as they sell their tickets. Muse doesn't appear to be like that. Even purchasing tickets, they allow the true fans to purchase first getting the best seats.\\nI look forward to seeing them again! Great show, great music, and a great time. Playing for almost 2 hours. Great job Muse!\\nThere is a reason these guys play in big arenas. It’s not just a few guys on a stage playing their music, it’s a production. Even up in the nosebleeds it was a great show.\\nSpoiler alert! Don’t read any further if you don’t want to know.\\nHad it all! Glowing glasses, lit up suits, giant robots, a piano that shoots lasers, dancers with flashlights, smoke machines and glowing batons, and a special appearance by Eddie! People hanging from wires, surprises coming up from trap doors, lasers, lasers and more lasers! The set was a blistering 26 songs lasting a little over two hours!\\nI will definitely see them again the next time they come to town. Though not from the balcony. They say “Don’t look down if you have a thing about heights.” That’s where the stage is!\\nGreat show.\\n</content>\\n\\nMake your judgment and output according to the requirements, determining whether the webpage content can fulfill the purpose of this search round\\n\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"max_tokens\": 8192,\n  \"cache_name\": \"OpenAIApiProxy.call\"\n}"}

Muse is known for a unique style of alt-rock, with electronic music leanings and a blend of classical music, which lends to an ethereal, melancholic sound.\\nStarting in the early ’90s under the original name Gothic Plague, the band toured relentlessly with bands such as Skunk Anansie. The band released its first EPs to a loyal fan base and was met with relative success in the UK indie charts. This earned the group crucial backing from the likes of Steve Lamacq and NME, and its debut studio album Showbiz was released in 1999, scoring relative chart success. The album has since gone on to become a certified platinum album in the UK.\\nMuse’s second album, released in 2001, revealed a growth in sound and ambition that is still evident in its records today. Origin of Symmetry saw the band shift into progressive rock territory, producing momentous singles like “New Born” and “Bliss.” The album acted as a catalyst that moved Muse into commercial and critical success for years to come. Its next four albums all topped the UK album charts, and the band has sold over 15 million albums worldwide.\\nIn 2003, Muse released its third album, Absolution. This album debuted at number one in the UK, and with time, became certified gold in the US. This album is widely considered the band’s breakthrough album, with key hits such as “Time Is Running Out” and “Hysteria” topping the charts. In support of this album, Muse headed out on a year-long international tour.\\nIn 2006, Muse released its fourth studio album, Black Holes and Revelations. This album debuted at number one on the charts in five countries. From this album, two singles, \\\"Supermassive Black Hole\\\" and \\\"Knights of Cydonia,\\\" became chart-toppers, reaching the top 10 hits in the UK.\\nMuse’s live shows also followed the same ambitious, gargantuan elevation of music. Famed for its tours, the band has won two Brit Awards for Best Live Act, and it sells out arenas and stadiums around the globe with ease. Muse has become a legendary force on the festival circuit, and has headlined Reading and Leeds, T in the Park, and Glastonbury over the years. At Glastonbury Festival 2010, a gigantic crowd to its pyramid stage set up at the latter event in 2010.\\nAround the same time, Muse’s latest album The Resistance was conquering all corners of the UK. The band then scooped three Grammy nominations and a win for Best Rock Album, which helped it officially break into the US. Its explosion in popularity led to its performance at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London – and to its single “Survival” becoming the official anthem of the event.\\nSince its acclaimed Olympic performance, Muse has gone on to produce three more albums. Released in 2015, Drones was an album that aimed to return to the original rock sound for which Muse was originally known, but weaved in a powerful statement on the dehumanization of modern warfare. with the release of Drones, Muse began another tour focused on small venues throughout the UK and theAlong US. Drones an immediate hit, topping charts globally.\\nAfter touring the globe, including headlining at major festivals, Muse continued its path forward with another album release in 2018 — Simulation Theory. This kicked off the Simulation Theory World Tour, which took the band all the way from Houston, Texas, to a final stop in Lima, Peru.\\nAt the end of 2019, Muse released a special compilation box titled Origin of Muse. This included remastered versions of its albums and previously unreleased music. This special edition is a dream come true for Muse fans. The box contains a 48-page book, nine CDs, four vinyl records. One of the highlights of the set is a fully-remastered version of the band’s debut album Showbiz.\\nMost recently, in 2022, Muse released the Will of the People. This album showcases the darker, heavier side of Muse’s music, with singles “Won’t Stand Down” and “Compliance” quickly becoming fan favorites.\\nKnown for its flawless performances, Muse continues to capture the depth of its musical history in every show. Fans, who are often referred to as Musers, flock to see the band perform at large arenas around the world. Most shows sell out, and in order to find a position near the front of the stage, Musers arrive hours ahead of showtime.\\nNot only does Muse deliver an incredibly dynamic and energetic live show, but its sound production is renowned for being top-quality. Bellamy’s vocals can be heard clearly, along with every accompanying instrument. Recently, touring member Morgan Nicholls was replaced by Dan Lancaster. Lancaster now plays additional keys, percussion, and guitar, as well as providing backup vocals.\\nTo snag tickets to a Muse tour date, make sure to pay attention to recently released tour schedules. Muse’s 2022-2023 “The Will of the People World” Tour reaches far and wide.\\nRead moreEnjoyed the band but not the show. The organizers failed in everything they could fail. Believe me, I've been to a lot of international shows here in Argentina and Chile, and this was the first time ever that I couldn't hear the music some times.\\nThe \\\"Complejo al Río\\\" is in a great zone of Vicente López, really near to buses, subway, and two of the most important avenues (Av. Santa Fe/Cabildo/Maipú and Av. Libertador); so I got there without any troubles and even had some food because there were a lot of places to eat or drink near it.\\nIt all went down when the showtime was getting near: I got in without getting checked, as most people, really dangerous; then, the entrance was full of construction debris (dangerous x2). Once I was in, I realized that the venue was pretty much a cement parking lot with a couple of bleachers, wouldn't be much of a problem if it weren't that: a) there were holes in the floor, so somebody could have get hurt while jumping and; b) it was on downhill, so that meant that in certain areas of the \\\"campo trasero\\\" you couldn't see anything.\\nWhen it started, everyone was excited, jumping, but two songs in we realised that we couldn't hear sometimes: the sound came and then go away. You could literally heard people talking over the music! And this wasn't an acoustic show! The low-volume stayed the whole gig, and it ruined songs like Madness that I could literally not hear. Bonus track: Matt confused Argentina with Uruguay and used their flag here. Everyone shouting \\\"NOOO\\\" which meant hearing even less.\\nGoing strictly to the show: the band pulled out a pretty good one, they didn't interacted with the public a lot but considering videos I've seen, that's just how they are. The setlist was the very same of two days ago in Chile, so there's nothing to complain about though we Argentinians are used to the fact that the bands always play more songs here, or change the setlist a bit. Muse was not the case.\\nI still had a great time and would totally go to see this band again, specially because I feel like I didn't got the full experience. It's too much to know that they never come with the full stages and theatrics to add the fact that they came without speakers.\\nThis was the 3rd concert I have seen Muse at. I have to say as far as concerts go, you won't find one with any more to it than a Muse concert. I have been to many concerts and I love them all. Music made in a studio is never going to capture the real live sound.

Read More: Muse: “There’s gonna be a big …\\nContent: Chris Wolstenholme has opened up about the future of Muse, and suggested that the band are already thinking about a new album.\\nThe bassist opened up about potential new material from the band during a new interview on The Leona Graham Podcast, and suggested that fans can hope to see a new album being shared in 2026.\\nDuring the interview, Wolstenholme was asked about the current status of the band – particularly with them not being signed to any label at the moment – and asked if this is something that would have to change before they could share any new music.\\n“We will [sign to a label], obviously. I think we’re gonna start work on the next record fairly soon,” he responded. “I think for the last few albums we’ve been with Warner and we’ve extended after each album. We may do the same again; we may go with a new label, who knows.”\\nHe continued, adding that the break between now and their last studio release, 2022’s ‘Will Of The People’, felt “natural” to take after their time touring, and that the members aren’t as willing to share a new record as often as they did in the past.\\n“When you finish touring an album, and [when] the band has been around a bit longer, the gaps between albums get a little bit bigger. I don’t think we can be banging out new albums every two years like we used to,” he explained. “But it gives you that opportunity to reset a little bit and think about what’s gonna happen going forward.”\\nRecommended\\n“I think we’ll start very, very soon, like in the next couple of months,” Wolstenholme added, giving an idea of the timeframe needed. “We’ve got a few gigs in June. Only a handful – that’s the only gigs we’re doing this year.\\n“I don’t think the idea is to do anything really serious until next year, so I would imagine that 2026 will be a new album, barring any disasters.”\\nThe interview with Wolstenholme comes just months after he shared details of a new project called Chromes and dropped two debut singles. The band saw the bassist take on frontman duties, which came after he sang lead and wrote lyrics for songs ‘Save Me’ and ‘Liquid State’ on Muse’s 2012 album ‘The 2nd Law’.\\nAs for the other members, the time since ‘Will Of The People’ has seen frontman Matt Bellamy welcome his second child with partner Elle Evans, and also record a score for an Audible version of 1984.\\nAround the time of ‘Will Of The People’s release, Bellamy spoke to NME about what the title of the album means, and said that he feels that a sense of change is coming across society.\\nReflecting on the coronavirus pandemic, the war in Ukraine and the cost of living crisis, the frontman said: “I think everyone knows we want a revolution, but we definitely don’t want a bunch of authoritarian lunatics from the right. That’s the last thing we want.\\n“And also we don’t want a total communist situation on the hard left either. I think what we want is something completely new. I don’t think it exists out there at the moment, but I think there’s a new type of politics that could emerge,” he added. “I would call it Meta-Centrism. It’s an oscillation between liberal, libertarian values for individuals – your social life, the ability to be whatever gender you are, all that kind of stuff – but then more socialist on things like land ownership, nature and energy distribution. It’s oscillation between the two poles.”\\n</content>\\n\\nMake your judgment and output according to the requirements, determining whether the webpage content can fulfill the purpose of this search round\\n\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"max_tokens\": 8192,\n  \"cache_name\": \"OpenAIApiProxy.call\"\n}"}

With the hip-hop genre dominating the charts and a dazzling new wave of female singers leading an exciting phase of pop music, rock's significance on the large stage has largely been relegated to a handful of legacy and veteran artists.\\nThis makes the UK group Muse an intriguing exception. Now well into their third decade, they continue to capture attention with high-concept albums and grandiose concerts brimming with pomp and spectacle.\\nEven when there isn’t a new album on the horizon, the trio remains ready to deliver a spectacle, as crowds discovered on Sunday at Abu Dhabi’s Etihad Park.\\nPerforming the closing concert of the Abu Dhabi F1 Grand Prix, the show marked their first of the year and started a jaunt that will see them play at Riyadh’s Soundstorm Festival on Friday.\\nThe time in between shows hasn’t left them rusty, with the group entering to recorded chants and launching into a blazing version of Won’t Stand Down.\\nIt is a shape-shifting highlight. Singer and guitarist Matt Bellamy begins the track with an Eastern-inspired guitar motif before settling into a punchy verse, then launching the song into a wall of crushing guitars and Dominic Howard’s thunderous drumming.\\nUp next is Hysteria with singer Bellamy’s potent vocal performance matched in intensity by Chris Wolstenholme’s dazzling bass lines. The song is one of their clearest examples of marrying sharp melodies with their signature technical, prog-rock prowess.\\nIt conjures the kind of energy only a committed rock band can deliver. If the Abu Dhabi show is part of their long-awaited return to touring, we can confidently report that Muse shows no signs of losing their will.\\nThe concert capped off another dynamic series of concerts at the Abu Dhabi F1 Grand Prix. It began on Thursday with the double bill of DJ Peggy Gou and soul singer Teddy Swims, followed a day later by Maroon 5, before Eminem performed to a capacity crowd of 40,000 people on Saturday.\\nAll tickets were exclusive to Abu Dhabi Grand Prix ticket holders.\\nSPEC%20SHEET%3A%20NOTHING%20PHONE%20(2A)\\n%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EDisplay%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%206.7-inch%20flexible%20Amoled%2C%202%2C412%20x%201%2C080%2C%20394ppi%2C%20120Hz%2C%20Corning%20Gorilla%20Glass%205%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EProcessor%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20MediaTek%20Dimensity%207%2C200%20Pro%2C%204nm%2C%20octa-core%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EMemory%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%208%2F12GB%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3ECapacity%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20128%2F256GB%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EPlatform%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20Android%2014%2C%20Nothing%20OS%202.5%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EMain%20camera%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20Dual%2050MP%20main%2C%20f%2F1.88%20%2B%2050MP%20ultra-wide%2C%20f%2F2.2%3B%20OIS%2C%20EIS%2C%20auto-focus%2C%20ultra%20XDR%2C%20night%20mode%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EMain%20camera%20video%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%204K%20%40%2030fps%2C%20full-HD%20%40%2060fps%3B%20slo-mo%20full-HD%20at%20120fps%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EFront%20camera%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%2032MP%20wide%2C%20f%2F2.2%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EBattery%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%205%2C000mAh%3B%2050%25%20in%2030%20minutes%20with%2045-watt%20charger%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EConnectivity%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20Wi-Fi%2C%20Bluetooth%205.3%2C%20NFC%20(Google%20Pay)%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EBiometrics%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20Fingerprint%2C%20face%20unlock%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EI%2FO%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20USB-C%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EDurability%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20IP54%2C%20limited%20protection%20from%20water%2Fdust%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3ECards%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20Dual-nano%20SIM%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EColours%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20Black%2C%20milk%2C%20white%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EIn%20the%20box%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20Nothing%20Phone%20(2a)%2C%20USB-C-to-USB-C%20cable%2C%20pre-applied%20screen%20protector%2C%20Sim%20tray%20ejector%20tool%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EPrice%20(UAE)%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20Dh1%2C199%20(8GB%2F128GB)%20%2F%20Dh1%2C399%20(12GB%2F256GB)%3C%2Fp%3E%0A\\nNEW%20PRICING%20SCHEME%20FOR%20APPLE%20MUSIC%2C%20TV%2B%20AND%20ONE\\n%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EApple%20Music%3Cbr%3EMonthly%20individual%3A%20%3C%2Fstrong%3E%2410.99%20(from%20%249.99)%3Cstrong%3E%3Cbr%3EMonthly%20family%3A%20%3C%2Fstrong%3E%2416.99%20(from%20%2414.99)%3Cstrong%3E%3Cbr%3EIndividual%20annual%3A%20%3C%2Fstrong%3E%24109%20(from%20%2499)%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EApple%20TV%2B%3Cbr%3EMonthly%3A%20%3C%2Fstrong%3E%246.99%20(from%20%244.99)%3Cstrong%3E%3Cbr%3EAnnual%3A%20%3C%2Fstrong%3E%2469%20(from%20%2449.99)%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EApple%20One%3Cbr%3EMonthly%20individual%3A%20%3C%2Fstrong%3E%2416.95%20(from%20%2414.95)%3Cstrong%3E%3Cbr%3EMonthly%20family%3A%20%3C%2Fstrong%3E%2422.95%20(from%20%2419.95)%3Cstrong%3E%3Cbr%3EMonthly%20premier%3A%20%3C%2Fstrong%3E%2432.95%20(from%20%2429.95)%3C%2Fp%3E%0A\\nDr Amal Khalid Alias revealed a recent case of a woman with daughters, who specifically wanted a boy.\\nA semen analysis of the father showed abnormal sperm so the couple required IVF.\\nOut of 21 eggs collected, six were unused leaving 15 suitable for IVF.\\nA specific procedure was used, called intracytoplasmic sperm injection where a single sperm cell is inserted into the egg.\\nOn day three of the process, 14 embryos were biopsied for gender selection.\\nThe next day, a pre-implantation genetic report revealed four normal male embryos, three female and seven abnormal samples.\\nDay five of the treatment saw two male embryos transferred to the patient.\\nThe woman recorded a positive pregnancy test two weeks later.\\nThe Sand Castle\\nDirector: Matty Brown\\nStars: Nadine Labaki, Ziad Bakri, Zain Al Rafeea, Riman Al Rafeea\\nRating: 2.5/5\\nLiving in...\\nThis article is part of a guide on where to live in the UAE.

I think we’re gonna start work on the next record fairly soon,” he responded. “I think for the last few albums we’ve been with Warner and we’ve extended after each album. We may do the same again; we may go with a new label, who knows.”\\nHe continued, adding that the break between now and their last studio release, 2022’s ‘Will Of The People’, felt “natural” to take after their time touring, and that the members aren’t as willing to share a new record as often as they did in the past.\\n“When you finish touring an album, and [when] the band has been around a bit longer, the gaps between albums get a little bit bigger. I don’t think we can be banging out new albums every two years like we used to,” he explained. “But it gives you that opportunity to reset a little bit and think about what’s gonna happen going forward.”\\nRecommended\\n“I think we’ll start very, very soon, like in the next couple of months,” Wolstenholme added, giving an idea of the timeframe needed. “We’ve got a few gigs in June. Only a handful – that’s the only gigs we’re doing this year.\\n“I don’t think the idea is to do anything really serious until next year, so I would imagine that 2026 will be a new album, barring any disasters.”\\nThe interview with Wolstenholme comes just months after he shared details of a new project called Chromes and dropped two debut singles. The band saw the bassist take on frontman duties, which came after he sang lead and wrote lyrics for songs ‘Save Me’ and ‘Liquid State’ on Muse’s 2012 album ‘The 2nd Law’.\\nAs for the other members, the time since ‘Will Of The People’ has seen frontman Matt Bellamy welcome his second child with partner Elle Evans, and also record a score for an Audible version of 1984.\\nAround the time of ‘Will Of The People’s release, Bellamy spoke to NME about what the title of the album means, and said that he feels that a sense of change is coming across society.\\nReflecting on the coronavirus pandemic, the war in Ukraine and the cost of living crisis, the frontman said: “I think everyone knows we want a revolution, but we definitely don’t want a bunch of authoritarian lunatics from the right. That’s the last thing we want.\\n“And also we don’t want a total communist situation on the hard left either. I think what we want is something completely new. I don’t think it exists out there at the moment, but I think there’s a new type of politics that could emerge,” he added. “I would call it Meta-Centrism. It’s an oscillation between liberal, libertarian values for individuals – your social life, the ability to be whatever gender you are, all that kind of stuff – but then more socialist on things like land ownership, nature and energy distribution. It’s oscillation between the two poles.”\\n</content>\\n\\nOrganize and extract as required, focusing solely on the webpage content itself.

The show was short but a very good one! The singer, Ricky Wilson, is very charismatic and an excellent dancer!\\nAbout Muse - Tour Simulation Theory:\\nthe sound was very good, the instruments were heard in good frequency and also the voices.\\nThe band has a strong connection on stage and a great dynamic between them.\\nThe setlist was very well chosen, mixing successful songs from previous albums, like Hysteria, Supermassive and Starlight; and new album hits like: Algorithm, Propaganda and Thought Contagion.\\nThe songs were similar to other shows that they played on this tour in all Latin America, but they surprised Santiago with the song Bliss (not in other setlists).\\nLead singer Matt sings very well live can make different tones of voice, is incredible, just like the albums!\\nIn addition, the lighting games and dancers who were on the stage during the show further contributed to the whole presentation.\\nThe show finished with Knights of Cydonia and made everyone very happy!\\nA great night! Thank you Muse!\\nThis was the 3rd concert I have seen Muse at. I have to say as far as concerts go, you won't find one with any more to it than a Muse concert. I have been to many concerts and I love them all. Music made in a studio is never going to capture the real live sound. Music is made to be played live!\\nThe Simulation tour was simply amazing. Visually, audibly and just being there. Having trombones being played, actually played not recorded and being a part of the opening was simply astonishing. It as a great sound and visually it was amazing. The same with Pressure, having the trombones out there added to the song and made it unbelievable.\\nThey also played Dig Down the acoustic gospel version live. With Dom, Matt and Chris playing center of the stadium. Chris on the acoustic guitar, Matt on the piano and Dom obviously on the drums. What a neat set to see them playing so close together and the gospel signers on stage lit up by their costumes. Very well done!\\nOur son didn't(teenager) didn't understand the Close Encounters of the 3rd kind part. Where Matt was playing the guitar and the mother ship was responding. He is too young. :-) My wife and I got it.\\nWatching Matt play his guitar by his tong! What? I had never seen anything like it. He is amazing. Chris is just amazing on bass and Dom on drums. These guys can do it all!\\nWhat a fun show. I really appreciate what Muse has done to give back to their fan's. Too many bands don't care as long as they sell their tickets. Muse doesn't appear to be like that. Even purchasing tickets, they allow the true fans to purchase first getting the best seats.\\nI look forward to seeing them again! Great show, great music, and a great time. Playing for almost 2 hours. Great job Muse!\\nThere is a reason these guys play in big arenas. It’s not just a few guys on a stage playing their music, it’s a production. Even up in the nosebleeds it was a great show.\\nSpoiler alert! Don’t read any further if you don’t want to know.\\nHad it all! Glowing glasses, lit up suits, giant robots, a piano that shoots lasers, dancers with flashlights, smoke machines and glowing batons, and a special appearance by Eddie! People hanging from wires, surprises coming up from trap doors, lasers, lasers and more lasers! The set was a blistering 26 songs lasting a little over two hours!\\nI will definitely see them again the next time they come to town. Though not from the balcony. They say “Don’t look down if you have a thing about heights.” That’s where the stage is!\\nGreat show.\\n</content>\\n\\nOrganize and extract as required, focusing solely on the webpage content itself.

Muse is known for a unique style of alt-rock, with electronic music leanings and a blend of classical music, which lends to an ethereal, melancholic sound.\\nStarting in the early ’90s under the original name Gothic Plague, the band toured relentlessly with bands such as Skunk Anansie. The band released its first EPs to a loyal fan base and was met with relative success in the UK indie charts. This earned the group crucial backing from the likes of Steve Lamacq and NME, and its debut studio album Showbiz was released in 1999, scoring relative chart success. The album has since gone on to become a certified platinum album in the UK.\\nMuse’s second album, released in 2001, revealed a growth in sound and ambition that is still evident in its records today. Origin of Symmetry saw the band shift into progressive rock territory, producing momentous singles like “New Born” and “Bliss.” The album acted as a catalyst that moved Muse into commercial and critical success for years to come. Its next four albums all topped the UK album charts, and the band has sold over 15 million albums worldwide.\\nIn 2003, Muse released its third album, Absolution. This album debuted at number one in the UK, and with time, became certified gold in the US. This album is widely considered the band’s breakthrough album, with key hits such as “Time Is Running Out” and “Hysteria” topping the charts. In support of this album, Muse headed out on a year-long international tour.\\nIn 2006, Muse released its fourth studio album, Black Holes and Revelations. This album debuted at number one on the charts in five countries. From this album, two singles, \\\"Supermassive Black Hole\\\" and \\\"Knights of Cydonia,\\\" became chart-toppers, reaching the top 10 hits in the UK.\\nMuse’s live shows also followed the same ambitious, gargantuan elevation of music. Famed for its tours, the band has won two Brit Awards for Best Live Act, and it sells out arenas and stadiums around the globe with ease. Muse has become a legendary force on the festival circuit, and has headlined Reading and Leeds, T in the Park, and Glastonbury over the years. At Glastonbury Festival 2010, a gigantic crowd to its pyramid stage set up at the latter event in 2010.\\nAround the same time, Muse’s latest album The Resistance was conquering all corners of the UK. The band then scooped three Grammy nominations and a win for Best Rock Album, which helped it officially break into the US. Its explosion in popularity led to its performance at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London – and to its single “Survival” becoming the official anthem of the event.\\nSince its acclaimed Olympic performance, Muse has gone on to produce three more albums. Released in 2015, Drones was an album that aimed to return to the original rock sound for which Muse was originally known, but weaved in a powerful statement on the dehumanization of modern warfare. with the release of Drones, Muse began another tour focused on small venues throughout the UK and theAlong US. Drones an immediate hit, topping charts globally.\\nAfter touring the globe, including headlining at major festivals, Muse continued its path forward with another album release in 2018 — Simulation Theory. This kicked off the Simulation Theory World Tour, which took the band all the way from Houston, Texas, to a final stop in Lima, Peru.\\nAt the end of 2019, Muse released a special compilation box titled Origin of Muse. This included remastered versions of its albums and previously unreleased music. This special edition is a dream come true for Muse fans. The box contains a 48-page book, nine CDs, four vinyl records. One of the highlights of the set is a fully-remastered version of the band’s debut album Showbiz.\\nMost recently, in 2022, Muse released the Will of the People. This album showcases the darker, heavier side of Muse’s music, with singles “Won’t Stand Down” and “Compliance” quickly becoming fan favorites.\\nKnown for its flawless performances, Muse continues to capture the depth of its musical history in every show. Fans, who are often referred to as Musers, flock to see the band perform at large arenas around the world. Most shows sell out, and in order to find a position near the front of the stage, Musers arrive hours ahead of showtime.\\nNot only does Muse deliver an incredibly dynamic and energetic live show, but its sound production is renowned for being top-quality. Bellamy’s vocals can be heard clearly, along with every accompanying instrument. Recently, touring member Morgan Nicholls was replaced by Dan Lancaster. Lancaster now plays additional keys, percussion, and guitar, as well as providing backup vocals.\\nTo snag tickets to a Muse tour date, make sure to pay attention to recently released tour schedules. Muse’s 2022-2023 “The Will of the People World” Tour reaches far and wide.\\nRead moreEnjoyed the band but not the show. The organizers failed in everything they could fail. Believe me, I've been to a lot of international shows here in Argentina and Chile, and this was the first time ever that I couldn't hear the music some times.\\nThe \\\"Complejo al Río\\\" is in a great zone of Vicente López, really near to buses, subway, and two of the most important avenues (Av. Santa Fe/Cabildo/Maipú and Av. Libertador); so I got there without any troubles and even had some food because there were a lot of places to eat or drink near it.\\nIt all went down when the showtime was getting near: I got in without getting checked, as most people, really dangerous; then, the entrance was full of construction debris (dangerous x2). Once I was in, I realized that the venue was pretty much a cement parking lot with a couple of bleachers, wouldn't be much of a problem if it weren't that: a) there were holes in the floor, so somebody could have get hurt while jumping and; b) it was on downhill, so that meant that in certain areas of the \\\"campo trasero\\\" you couldn't see anything.\\nWhen it started, everyone was excited, jumping, but two songs in we realised that we couldn't hear sometimes: the sound came and then go away. You could literally heard people talking over the music! And this wasn't an acoustic show! The low-volume stayed the whole gig, and it ruined songs like Madness that I could literally not hear. Bonus track: Matt confused Argentina with Uruguay and used their flag here. Everyone shouting \\\"NOOO\\\" which meant hearing even less.\\nGoing strictly to the show: the band pulled out a pretty good one, they didn't interacted with the public a lot but considering videos I've seen, that's just how they are. The setlist was the very same of two days ago in Chile, so there's nothing to complain about though we Argentinians are used to the fact that the bands always play more songs here, or change the setlist a bit. Muse was not the case.\\nI still had a great time and would totally go to see this band again, specially because I feel like I didn't got the full experience. It's too much to know that they never come with the full stages and theatrics to add the fact that they came without speakers.\\nThis was the 3rd concert I have seen Muse at. I have to say as far as concerts go, you won't find one with any more to it than a Muse concert. I have been to many concerts and I love them all. Music made in a studio is never going to capture the real live sound. Music is made to be played live!\\nThe Simulation tour was simply amazing. Visually, audibly and just being there. Having trombones being played, actually played not recorded and being a part of the opening was simply astonishing. It as a great sound and visually it was amazing. The same with Pressure, having the trombones out there added to the song and made it unbelievable.\\nThey also played Dig Down the acoustic gospel version live. With Dom, Matt and Chris playing center of the stadium. Chris on the acoustic guitar, Matt on the piano and Dom obviously on the drums. What a neat set to see them playing so close together and the gospel signers on stage lit up by their costumes. Very well done!\\nOur son didn't(teenager) didn't understand the Close Encounters of...Omiting #9907 chars\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"max_tokens\": 8192,\n  \"cache_name\": \"OpenAIApiProxy.call\"\n}"}

The story is intended for an adult audience and is approximately 1000 words in length. The design tasks have provided a comprehensive framework, including the plot, characters, setting, theme, tone, conflict, and resolution. The reference planning suggests breaking the writing task into three parts: introduction, development, and climax/resolution. This structure aligns well with the narrative arc and allows for a clear progression of the story.\n\nGiven the complexity of integrating multiple design elements into a cohesive narrative, it is beneficial to further break down the writing task into smaller sub-tasks. This will ensure that each part of the story is well-developed and that all elements are effectively woven together. The sub-tasks will focus on writing the introduction, development, and climax/resolution, with each section building upon the previous one to create a seamless narrative.\n\nThe introduction will establish the setting and main characters, setting the stage for the story. The development section will introduce the conflict and explore character dynamics, deepening the narrative and building tension. Finally, the climax and resolution will resolve the conflict and conclude the story, providing a satisfying ending that aligns with the themes and tone.\n\nTo support the writing process, additional design sub-tasks will be included to refine specific elements, such as the introduction scene, conflict escalation, and resolution details. These design tasks will ensure that each writing sub-task is well-prepared and that the story maintains coherence and integration of all elements.\n\nThe dependency relationships between the sub-tasks will be carefully considered to ensure a logical flow of the narrative. The introduction will lay the groundwork for the development, which will, in turn, lead to the climax and resolution. Each writing sub-task will depend on the design tasks that provide the necessary details and context for that section of the story.\n\nOverall, the plan will ensure that the story is engaging, cohesive, and aligned with the intended themes and tone, providing a compelling fairy tale experience for an adult audience.\n</think>\n\n<result>\n{\n  \"id\": \"4\",\n  \"task_type\": \"write\",\n  \"goal\": \"Write the complete fairy story, integrating the designed elements into a cohesive narrative.\",\n  \"dependency\": [\"1\", \"2\", \"3\"],\n  \"length\": \"1000 words\",\n  \"sub_tasks\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"4.1\",\n      \"task_type\": \"write\",\n      \"goal\": \"Write the introduction, establishing the setting and main characters.\",\n      \"dependency\": [],\n      \"length\": \"300 words\",\n      \"sub_tasks\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"4.1.1\",\n          \"task_type\": \"think\",\n          \"goal\": \"Design the opening scene, introducing Evelyn and the magical book that hints at the mystical forest.\",\n          \"dependency\": []\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"4.1.2\",\n          \"task_type\": \"think\",\n          \"goal\": \"Determine how to subtly introduce the theme of identity and self-discovery in the introduction.\",\n          \"dependency\": [\"4.1.1\"]\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"4.1.3\",\n          \"task_type\": \"write\",\n          \"goal\": \"Write the introduction, incorporating the designed scene and thematic elements.\",\n          \"dependency\": [\"4.1.1\", \"4.1.2\"],\n          \"length\": \"300 words\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"4.2\",\n      \"task_type\": \"write\",\n      \"goal\": \"Write the development section, introducing the conflict and exploring character dynamics.\",\n      \"dependency\": [],\n      \"length\": \"400 words\",\n      \"sub_tasks\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"4.2.1\",\n          \"task_type\": \"think\",\n          \"goal\": \"Detail the initial interactions between Evelyn and Finn, highlighting their developing relationship and the introduction of the Shadow King's threat.\",\n          \"dependency\": []\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"4.2.2\",\n          \"task_type\": \"think\",\n          \"goal\": \"Plan the escalation of the conflict, focusing on Finn's internal struggle and Evelyn's growing involvement.\",\n          \"dependency\": [\"4.2.1\"]\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"4.2.3\",\n          \"task_type\": \"write\",\n          \"goal\": \"Write the development section, integrating the designed interactions and conflict escalation.\",\n          \"dependency\": [\"4.2.1\", \"4.2.2\"],\n          \"length\": \"400 words\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"4.3\",\n      \"task_type\": \"write\",\n      \"goal\": \"Write the climax and resolution, resolving the conflict and concluding the story.\",\n      \"dependency\": [],\n      \"length\": \"300 words\",\n      \"sub_tasks\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"4.3.1\",\n          \"task_type\": \"think\",\n          \"goal\": \"Design the climactic confrontation with the Shadow King, focusing on Evelyn's empowerment and Finn's redemption.\",\n          \"dependency\": []\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"4.3.2\",\n          \"task_type\": \"think\",\n          \"goal\": \"Plan the resolution, ensuring a hopeful conclusion that aligns with the themes of balance and transformation.\",\n          \"dependency\": [\"4.3.1\"]\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"4.3.3\",\n          \"task_type\": \"write\",\n          \"goal\": \"Write the climax and resolution, incorporating the designed confrontation and resolution.\",\n          \"dependency\": [\"4.3.1\", \"4.3.2\"],\n          \"length\": \"300 words\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</result>", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "add_time": "2025-03-14_17:33:55", "hint": "{\n  \"model\": \"gpt-4o\",\n  \"messages\": [\n    {\n      \"role\": \"system\",\n      \"content\": \"# Overall Introduction\\nYou are a recursive professional novel-writing planning expert adept at planning professional novel writing based on narrative theory. A high-level plan tailored to the user's novel-writing needs is already in place, and your task is to further recursively plan the specified writing sub-tasks within this framework. Through your planning, the resulting novel will strictly adhere to user requirements and achieve perfection in terms of plot, creativity (ideas, themes, and topics), and development.\\n\\n1. Continue the recursive planning for the specified professional novel-writing sub-tasks. According to narrative theory, the organization of story writing and the result of the design tasks, break the tasks down into more granular writing sub-tasks, specifying their scope and specific writing content.  \\n2. Plan design sub-tasks as needed to assist and support specific writing. Design sub-tasks can include designing core conflicts, character settings, outlines and detailed outlines, key story beats, story backgrounds, plot elements, etc., to support the actual writing.  \\n3. For each task, plan a sub-task DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), where the edges represent dependency relationships between design tasks within the same layer of the DAG. Recursively plan each sub-task until all sub-tasks are atomic tasks.\\n\\n# Task Types\\n## Writing (Core, actual writing)\\n- **Function**: Perform actual novel-writing tasks in sequence according to the plan. Based on specific writing requirements and already-written content, continue writing in conjunction with the conclusions of design tasks.  \\n- **All writing tasks are continuation tasks**: Ensure continuity with the preceding content during planning. Writing tasks should flow smoothly and seamlessly with one another.  \\n- **Breakable tasks**: Writing, Design  \\n- Unless necessary, each writing sub-task should be > 500 words.\\n\\n## Design\\n- **Function**: Analyze and design any novel-writing needs other than actual writing. This includes but is not limited to designing core conflicts, character settings, outlines and detailed outlines, key story beats, story backgrounds, plot elements, etc., to support the actual writing.  \\n- **Breakable tasks**: Design  \\n\\n# Information Provided to You\\n- **`Already-written novel content`**: Content from previous writing tasks that has already been written.  \\n- **`Overall plan`**: The overall writing plan, which specifies the task you need to plan through the `is_current_to_plan_task` key.  \\n- **`Results of design tasks completed in higher-level tasks`**  \\n- **`Results of design tasks dependent on the same-layer DAG tasks`**  \\n- **`Writing tasks that require further planning`**  \\n- **`Reference planning`**: A planning sample is provided, which you may cautiously reference.  \\n\\n# Planning Tips\\n1. The last sub-task derived from a writing task must always be a writing task.  \\n2. Reasonably control the number of sub-tasks in each layer of the DAG, generally 3–5 sub-tasks. If the number of tasks exceeds this, aim to plan recursively.  \\n3. **Design tasks** can serve as **sub-tasks of writing tasks**, and as many design sub-tasks as possible should be generated to enhance the quality of writing.  \\n4. Use `dependency` to list the IDs of design tasks within the same-layer DAG. List all potential dependencies as comprehensively as possible.  \\n5. When a design sub-task involves designing specific writing structures (e.g., plot design), subsequent dependent writing tasks should not be laid out flat but should await recursive planning in subsequent rounds.  \\n6. **Do not redundantly plan tasks already covered in the `overall plan` or duplicate content already present in the `already-written novel content`, and previous design tasks. ** \\n7. Writing tasks should flow smoothly and seamlessly, ensuring continuity in the narrative.\\n8. Following the Results of design tasks\\n\\n# Task Attributes\\n1. **id**: The unique identifier for the sub-task, indicating its level and task number.  \\n2. **goal**: A precise and complete description of the sub-task goal in string format.  \\n3. **dependency**: A list of design task IDs from the same-layer DAG that this task depends on. List all potential dependencies as comprehensively as possible. If there are no dependent sub-tasks, this should be empty.  \\n4. **task_type**: A string indicating the type of task. Writing tasks are labeled as `write`, and design tasks are labeled as `think`.  \\n5. **length**: For writing tasks, this attribute specifies the scope, it is required for writing task. Design tasks do not require this attribute.  \\n6. **sub_tasks**: A JSON list representing the sub-task DAG. Each element in the list is a JSON object representing a task.\\n\\n\\n# Example\\n\\n<example index=1>\\nUser-given writing task:\\n{\\n    \\\"id\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n    \\\"task_type\\\": \\\"write\\\",\\n    \\\"goal\\\": \\\"Create an excellent suspense story set in the colony on Europa (Jupiter’s moon), incorporating the real environmental characteristics of Europa.

The task requires writing a 1000-word fairy story for adults, which is a manageable length for a single writing task. The design elements are well-defined, and there are no additional design requirements needed to support the writing. Therefore, the goal does not need any updates as it is already aligned with the demands and is detailed enough.\\n\\nAccording to the atomic task determination rules, the task involves writing a complete story of 1000 words, which is slightly above the threshold for a short piece of writing (500 words or less). However, given the complexity of integrating multiple design elements into a cohesive narrative, it may require further planning to ensure all elements are effectively woven together. Therefore, this task is considered a complex task, as it involves more than just straightforward writing and may benefit from breaking down into smaller writing sub-tasks or additional planning to ensure coherence and integration of all elements.\\n---\\n\\nAlready-written novel content: \\n```\\n\\n```\\n\\nOverall plan: \\n```\\n{'id': '', 'task_type': 'write', 'goal': 'Write a fairy story for adult.

Her days blurred into one another, a ceaseless cycle of deadlines and edits, each manuscript a mirror reflecting her own unfulfilled dreams. The city, with its towering skyscrapers and bustling streets, felt like a cage, its iron bars forged from routine and repetition.\n\nEvelyn, a woman of thirty-two autumns, possessed an insatiable curiosity that simmered beneath her composed exterior. Her heart yearned for the thrill of discovery, for the kind of adventure that her well-worn novels whispered of. Yet, reality kept her tethered to her desk, her world confined to the pages she meticulously curated.\n\nIt was on a rain-soaked evening, as the city wept and the streets glistened like obsidian, that Evelyn stumbled upon a peculiar bookstore nestled in a forgotten alley. Its sign, faded and weathered by time, bore the name \"The Enchanted Quill.\" Inside, the air was thick with the scent of parchment and possibility. Shelves bowed under the weight of ancient tomes, their spines whispering secrets of worlds unseen.\n\nAmong the dusty volumes, one book called to her—a leather-bound relic, its cover embossed with symbols that seemed to pulse with a life of their own. As she traced her fingers over its surface, a warmth spread through her, a promise of magic and mystery. The book spoke of a forest, a realm untouched by the passage of time, where balance hung by a delicate thread.\n\nEvelyn's heart quickened, her pulse a drumbeat of anticipation. Here, in this forgotten corner of the city, she glimpsed a portal to the extraordinary. And so, with the book cradled in her arms, she stepped into the unknown, leaving behind the familiar shadows of her life in search of the enchanted balance that awaited her. \n</article>", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "add_time": "2025-03-14_17:34:17", "hint": "{\n  \"model\": \"gpt-4o\",\n  \"messages\": [\n    {\n      \"role\": \"system\",\n      \"content\": \"You are a professional and innovative writer collaborating with other writers to create a user-requested novel.  \\n\\n### Requirements:\\n- Start from the previous ending of the story, matching the existing text's writing style, vocabulary, and overall atmosphere.

The design tasks have already outlined the core elements of the story, including the plot, characters, setting, theme, tone, conflict, and resolution. The development section should focus on introducing the conflict and exploring character dynamics, particularly between Evelyn and Finn, as well as the external threat posed by the Shadow King.\n\nThe task length is specified as 400 words, which is a concise amount for introducing the conflict and character dynamics. Given the detailed design conclusions, the task is well-defined, and the necessary design elements are already in place. Therefore, no further design sub-tasks are needed.\n\nRegarding the writing sub-task, the task involves a short piece of writing (400 words) and does not contain complex twists that would require further breakdown. Thus, it qualifies as an atomic task.\n\nNo updates are needed for the goal, as it is already aligned with the overall plan and design conclusions.\n</think>\n<result>\n<goal_updating>\nWrite the development section, introducing the conflict and exploring character dynamics.\n</goal_updating>\n<atomic_task_determination>\natomic\n</atomic_task_determination>\n</result>", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "add_time": "2025-03-14_17:34:24", "hint": "{\n  \"model\": \"gpt-4o\",\n  \"messages\": [\n    {\n      \"role\": \"system\",\n      \"content\": \"# Summary and Introduction\\nYou are the goal-updating and atomic writing task determination Agent in a recursive professional novel-writing planning system:\\n\\n1. **Goal Updating**: Based on the overall plan, the already-written novel, and existing design conclusions, update or revise the current writing task requirements as needed to make them more aligned with demands, reasonable, and detailed. For example, provide more detailed requirements based on design conclusions, or remove redundant content in the already-written novel.\\n\\n2. **Atomic Writing Task Determination**: Within the context of the overall plan and the already-written novel, evaluate whether the given writing task is an atomic task, meaning it does not require further planning. According to narrative theory and the organization of story writing, a writing task can be further broken down into more granular writing sub-tasks and design sub-tasks. Writing tasks involve the actual creation of specific portions of text, while design tasks may involve designing core conflicts, character settings, outlines and detailed outlines, key story beats, story backgrounds, plot elements, etc., to support the actual writing.\\n\\n# Goal Updating Tips\\n- Based on the overall plan, the already-written novel, and existing design conclusions, update or revise the current writing task requirements as needed to make them more aligned with demands, reasonable, and detailed. For example, provide more detailed requirements based on design conclusions, or remove redundant content in the already-written novel.\\n- Directly output the updated goal. If no updates are needed, output the original goal.\\n\\n# Atomic Task Determination Rules\\nIndependently determine, in order, whether the following two types of sub-tasks need to be broken down:\\n\\n1. **design Sub-task**: If the writing requires certain design designs for support, and these design requirements are not provided by the **dependent design tasks** or the **already completed novel content**, then an design sub-task needs to be planned.\\n\\n2. **Writing Sub-task**: If the task involves a short piece of writing (e.g., 500 words or less) and does not contain complex twists, there is no need to further plan additional writing sub-tasks.\\n\\nIf either an design sub-task or a writing sub-task needs to be created, the task is considered a complex task.\\n\\n\\n# Output Format\\n1. First, think through the goal update in `<think></think>`. Then, based on the atomic task determination rules, evaluate in-depth and comprehensively whether design and writing sub-tasks need to be broken down. This determines whether the task is an atomic task or a complex task.\\n\\n2. Then, output the results in `<result></result>`. In `<goal_updating></goal_updating>`, directly output the updated goal; if no updates are needed, output the original goal.

Her days blurred into one another, a ceaseless cycle of deadlines and edits, each manuscript a mirror reflecting her own unfulfilled dreams. The city, with its towering skyscrapers and bustling streets, felt like a cage, its iron bars forged from routine and repetition.\\n\\nEvelyn, a woman of thirty-two autumns, possessed an insatiable curiosity that simmered beneath her composed exterior. Her heart yearned for the thrill of discovery, for the kind of adventure that her well-worn novels whispered of. Yet, reality kept her tethered to her desk, her world confined to the pages she meticulously curated.\\n\\nIt was on a rain-soaked evening, as the city wept and the streets glistened like obsidian, that Evelyn stumbled upon a peculiar bookstore nestled in a forgotten alley. Its sign, faded and weathered by time, bore the name \\\"The Enchanted Quill.\\\" Inside, the air was thick with the scent of parchment and possibility. Shelves bowed under the weight of ancient tomes, their spines whispering secrets of worlds unseen.\\n\\nAmong the dusty volumes, one book called to her—a leather-bound relic, its cover embossed with symbols that seemed to pulse with a life of their own. As she traced her fingers over its surface, a warmth spread through her, a promise of magic and mystery. The book spoke of a forest, a realm untouched by the passage of time, where balance hung by a delicate thread.\\n\\nEvelyn's heart quickened, her pulse a drumbeat of anticipation. Here, in this forgotten corner of the city, she glimpsed a portal to the extraordinary. And so, with the book cradled in her arms, she stepped into the unknown, leaving behind the familiar shadows of her life in search of the enchanted balance that awaited her.\\n```\\n\\noverall plan\\n```\\n{'id': '', 'task_type': 'write', 'goal': 'Write a fairy story for adult.

This album is a personal navigation through those fears and preparation for what comes next.”\\nNow the band has offered more details on what to expect, telling Apple Music 1 that the album spans genres.\\n“We’ve always tried to think outside the box,” Bellamy said (via NME). “We’ve never been one particular genre.\\n“This album goes from metal all the way to pop to my first version to an Adele song… a lot of electronica. It’s like a full…We produced it ourselves. We were analysing everything we’ve done to date. The last song on the album is called ‘We Are Fucking Fucked’. I’m really happy and proud of it. I genuinely think it’s our best album.”\\nBellamy also revealed that he let drummer Dominic Howard “take the lead a little bit” on this project.\\n“That’s why this album’s taken two years. Every decision takes like a week for him to come back to us. Normally I just rush everything. With him he’s really slow, takes his time with every decision. I allowed him to make a lot of decisions about what was good and what wasn’t.”\\nLast week Muse released latest single ‘Compliance’, following January’s comeback track ‘Won’t Stand Down’ – their first new music since 2018’s ‘Simulation Theory’.\\n‘Will Of The People’ is available to pre-order here.\\n‘Will of the People’ tracklist:\\n1. ‘Will Of The People‘\\n2. ‘Compliance‘\\n3. ‘Liberation‘\\n4. ‘Won’t Stand Down‘\\n5. ‘Ghosts (How Can I Move On)‘\\n6. ‘You Make Me Feel Like It’s Halloween‘\\n7. ‘Kill Or Be Killed‘\\n8. ‘Verona‘\\n9. ‘Euphoria‘\\n10. ‘We Are Fucking Fucked‘\\n</content>\\n\\nMake your judgment and output according to the requirements, determining whether the webpage content can fulfill the purpose of this search round\\n\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"max_tokens\": 8192,\n  \"cache_name\": \"OpenAIApiProxy.call\"\n}"}

It demonstrates a heavier, metal-influenced direction for the new material.\\nA new Muse album, which will be their first since 2018’s ‘Simulation Theory’, has been expected for some time. Back in May 2020, Bellamy told NME that the band were planning on spending the following year recording back in their hometown of Teignmouth in Devon.\\n“We’re likely to get in the studio next year to make a new album of some kind and then tour after that, depending on the travel restrictions,” he said.\\nA few months later, he told The Sun that his new songs were inspired by that year’s Black Lives Matter protests against racial inequality.\\n“I started writing when all the protests and all the chaos were kicking off,” he said. “It’s a weird thing to say but it suits the music I write. It keeps you a little bit on edge.”\\nLast year also saw the release of a remixed version of the band’s 2001 album ‘Origin Of Symmetry’, marking the record’s 20th anniversary, as well as a Record Store Day exclusive album of Matt Bellamy solo recordings called ‘Cryosleep’.\\nBellamy also formed a part of the supergroup The Jaded Hearts Club, alongside Miles Kane and Graham Coxon, who released a cover of Northern Soul classic ‘Do I Love You (Indeed I Do).\\nMuse have already announced a number huge festival headline shows for this summer. They’ll play Isle of Wight Festival in June, alongside the likes of Lewis Capaldi and Kasabian, followed by a set at Madrid’s Mad Cool Festival the following month, plus shows at Germanys’s Rock am Ring and Rock im Park.\\n</content>\\n\\nMake your judgment and output according to the requirements, determining whether the webpage content can fulfill the purpose of this search round\\n\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"max_tokens\": 8192,\n  \"cache_name\": \"OpenAIApiProxy.call\"\n}"}

Read More: Muse: “There’s gonna be a big …\\nContent: Chris Wolstenholme has opened up about the future of Muse, and suggested that the band are already thinking about a new album.\\nThe bassist opened up about potential new material from the band during a new interview on The Leona Graham Podcast, and suggested that fans can hope to see a new album being shared in 2026.\\nDuring the interview, Wolstenholme was asked about the current status of the band – particularly with them not being signed to any label at the moment – and asked if this is something that would have to change before they could share any new music.\\n“We will [sign to a label], obviously. I think we’re gonna start work on the next record fairly soon,” he responded. “I think for the last few albums we’ve been with Warner and we’ve extended after each album. We may do the same again; we may go with a new label, who knows.”\\nHe continued, adding that the break between now and their last studio release, 2022’s ‘Will Of The People’, felt “natural” to take after their time touring, and that the members aren’t as willing to share a new record as often as they did in the past.\\n“When you finish touring an album, and [when] the band has been around a bit longer, the gaps between albums get a little bit bigger. I don’t think we can be banging out new albums every two years like we used to,” he explained. “But it gives you that opportunity to reset a little bit and think about what’s gonna happen going forward.”\\nRecommended\\n“I think we’ll start very, very soon, like in the next couple of months,” Wolstenholme added, giving an idea of the timeframe needed. “We’ve got a few gigs in June. Only a handful – that’s the only gigs we’re doing this year.\\n“I don’t think the idea is to do anything really serious until next year, so I would imagine that 2026 will be a new album, barring any disasters.”\\nThe interview with Wolstenholme comes just months after he shared details of a new project called Chromes and dropped two debut singles. The band saw the bassist take on frontman duties, which came after he sang lead and wrote lyrics for songs ‘Save Me’ and ‘Liquid State’ on Muse’s 2012 album ‘The 2nd Law’.\\nAs for the other members, the time since ‘Will Of The People’ has seen frontman Matt Bellamy welcome his second child with partner Elle Evans, and also record a score for an Audible version of 1984.\\nAround the time of ‘Will Of The People’s release, Bellamy spoke to NME about what the title of the album means, and said that he feels that a sense of change is coming across society.\\nReflecting on the coronavirus pandemic, the war in Ukraine and the cost of living crisis, the frontman said: “I think everyone knows we want a revolution, but we definitely don’t want a bunch of authoritarian lunatics from the right. That’s the last thing we want.\\n“And also we don’t want a total communist situation on the hard left either. I think what we want is something completely new. I don’t think it exists out there at the moment, but I think there’s a new type of politics that could emerge,” he added. “I would call it Meta-Centrism. It’s an oscillation between liberal, libertarian values for individuals – your social life, the ability to be whatever gender you are, all that kind of stuff – but then more socialist on things like land ownership, nature and energy distribution. It’s oscillation between the two poles.”\\n</content>\\n\\nMake your judgment and output according to the requirements, determining whether the webpage content can fulfill the purpose of this search round\\n\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"max_tokens\": 8192,\n  \"cache_name\": \"OpenAIApiProxy.call\"\n}"}

Her days blurred into one another, a ceaseless cycle of deadlines and edits, each manuscript a mirror reflecting her own unfulfilled dreams. The city, with its towering skyscrapers and bustling streets, felt like a cage, its iron bars forged from routine and repetition.\\n\\nEvelyn, a woman of thirty-two autumns, possessed an insatiable curiosity that simmered beneath her composed exterior. Her heart yearned for the thrill of discovery, for the kind of adventure that her well-worn novels whispered of. Yet, reality kept her tethered to her desk, her world confined to the pages she meticulously curated.\\n\\nIt was on a rain-soaked evening, as the city wept and the streets glistened like obsidian, that Evelyn stumbled upon a peculiar bookstore nestled in a forgotten alley. Its sign, faded and weathered by time, bore the name \\\"The Enchanted Quill.\\\" Inside, the air was thick with the scent of parchment and possibility. Shelves bowed under the weight of ancient tomes, their spines whispering secrets of worlds unseen.\\n\\nAmong the dusty volumes, one book called to her—a leather-bound relic, its cover embossed with symbols that seemed to pulse with a life of their own. As she traced her fingers over its surface, a warmth spread through her, a promise of magic and mystery.

It demonstrates a heavier, metal-influenced direction for the new material.\\nA new Muse album, which will be their first since 2018’s ‘Simulation Theory’, has been expected for some time. Back in May 2020, Bellamy told NME that the band were planning on spending the following year recording back in their hometown of Teignmouth in Devon.\\n“We’re likely to get in the studio next year to make a new album of some kind and then tour after that, depending on the travel restrictions,” he said.\\nA few months later, he told The Sun that his new songs were inspired by that year’s Black Lives Matter protests against racial inequality.\\n“I started writing when all the protests and all the chaos were kicking off,” he said. “It’s a weird thing to say but it suits the music I write. It keeps you a little bit on edge.”\\nLast year also saw the release of a remixed version of the band’s 2001 album ‘Origin Of Symmetry’, marking the record’s 20th anniversary, as well as a Record Store Day exclusive album of Matt Bellamy solo recordings called ‘Cryosleep’.\\nBellamy also formed a part of the supergroup The Jaded Hearts Club, alongside Miles Kane and Graham Coxon, who released a cover of Northern Soul classic ‘Do I Love You (Indeed I Do).\\nMuse have already announced a number huge festival headline shows for this summer.

Read More: Muse: “There’s gonna be a big …\\nContent: Chris Wolstenholme has opened up about the future of Muse, and suggested that the band are already thinking about a new album.\\nThe bassist opened up about potential new material from the band during a new interview on The Leona Graham Podcast, and suggested that fans can hope to see a new album being shared in 2026.\\nDuring the interview, Wolstenholme was asked about the current status of the band – particularly with them not being signed to any label at the moment – and asked if this is something that would have to change before they could share any new music.\\n“We will [sign to a label], obviously. I think we’re gonna start work on the next record fairly soon,” he responded. “I think for the last few albums we’ve been with Warner and we’ve extended after each album. We may do the same again; we may go with a new label, who knows.”\\nHe continued, adding that the break between now and their last studio release, 2022’s ‘Will Of The People’, felt “natural” to take after their time touring, and that the members aren’t as willing to share a new record as often as they did in the past.\\n“When you finish touring an album, and [when] the band has been around a bit longer, the gaps between albums get a little bit bigger. I don’t think we can be banging out new albums every two years like we used to,” he explained. “But it gives you that opportunity to reset a little bit and think about what’s gonna happen going forward.”\\nRecommended\\n“I think we’ll start very, very soon, like in the next couple of months,” Wolstenholme added, giving an idea of the timeframe needed. “We’ve got a few gigs in June. Only a handful – that’s the only gigs we’re doing this year.\\n“I don’t think the idea is to do anything really serious until next year, so I would imagine that 2026 will be a new album, barring any disasters.”\\nThe interview with Wolstenholme comes just months after he shared details of a new project called Chromes and dropped two debut singles. The band saw the bassist take on frontman duties, which came after he sang lead and wrote lyrics for songs ‘Save Me’ and ‘Liquid State’ on Muse’s 2012 album ‘The 2nd Law’.\\nAs for the other members, the time since ‘Will Of The People’ has seen frontman Matt Bellamy welcome his second child with partner Elle Evans, and also record a score for an Audible version of 1984.\\nAround the time of ‘Will Of The People’s release, Bellamy spoke to NME about what the title of the album means, and said that he feels that a sense of change is coming across society.\\nReflecting on the coronavirus pandemic, the war in Ukraine and the cost of living crisis, the frontman said: “I think everyone knows we want a revolution, but we definitely don’t want a bunch of authoritarian lunatics from the right. That’s the last thing we want.\\n“And also we don’t want a total communist situation on the hard left either. I think what we want is something completely new. I don’t think it exists out there at the moment, but I think there’s a new type of politics that could emerge,” he added. “I would call it Meta-Centrism. It’s an oscillation between liberal, libertarian values for individuals – your social life, the ability to be whatever gender you are, all that kind of stuff – but then more socialist on things like land ownership, nature and energy distribution. It’s oscillation between the two poles.”\\n</content>\\n\\nOrganize and extract as required, focusing solely on the webpage content itself.

Her days blurred into one another, a ceaseless cycle of deadlines and edits, each manuscript a mirror reflecting her own unfulfilled dreams. The city, with its towering skyscrapers and bustling streets, felt like a cage, its iron bars forged from routine and repetition.\\n\\nEvelyn, a woman of thirty-two autumns, possessed an insatiable curiosity that simmered beneath her composed exterior. Her heart yearned for the thrill of discovery, for the kind of adventure that her well-worn novels whispered of. Yet, reality kept her tethered to her desk, her world confined to the pages she meticulously curated.\\n\\nIt was on a rain-soaked evening, as the city wept and the streets glistened like obsidian, that Evelyn stumbled upon a peculiar bookstore nestled in a forgotten alley. Its sign, faded and weathered by time, bore the name \\\"The Enchanted Quill.\\\" Inside, the air was thick with the scent of parchment and possibility. Shelves bowed under the weight of ancient tomes, their spines whispering secrets of worlds unseen.\\n\\nAmong the dusty volumes, one book called to her—a leather-bound relic, its cover embossed with symbols that seemed to pulse with a life of their own. As she traced her fingers over its surface, a warmth spread through her, a promise of magic and mystery. The book spoke of a forest, a realm untouched by the passage of time, where balance hung by a delicate thread.\\n\\nEvelyn's heart quickened, her pulse a drumbeat of anticipation. Here, in this forgotten corner of the city, she glimpsed a portal to the extraordinary. And so, with the book cradled in her arms, she stepped into the unknown, leaving behind the familiar shadows of her life in search of the enchanted balance that awaited her.\\n\\nThe forest, a tapestry of emerald and shadow, unfolded before Evelyn like a dream half-remembered. Each step she took was a dance with the unknown, the air alive with the symphony of rustling leaves and distant whispers. Here, the world was a kaleidoscope of vibrant hues, where sunlight dappled through the canopy, painting the forest floor in patterns of gold and jade.\\n\\nAs Evelyn ventured deeper, the weight of the city fell away, replaced by a sense of belonging she had never known. Her heart, once heavy with the chains of routine, now soared with the promise of adventure. Yet, beneath the surface of this newfound wonder, a tension simmered—a foreboding presence that lingered in the shadows, watching, waiting.\\n\\nIt was amidst this ethereal beauty that Evelyn first encountered Finn. He emerged from the depths of the forest, a figure of grace and enigma. His eyes, a tumultuous sea of stormy blues, held secrets as ancient as the trees themselves. There was an air of melancholy about him, a prince burdened by the weight of realms.\\n\\n\\\"Welcome, traveler,\\\" Finn's voice was a melody, both haunting and alluring. \\\"You tread upon sacred ground, where balance is both a gift and a curse.\\\"\\n\\nEvelyn, captivated by his presence, felt a pull towards him—a connection that defied logic. \\\"I seek the truth of this place,\\\" she replied, her voice steady despite the flutter in her chest. \\\"The book spoke of a realm in peril.\\\"\\n\\nFinn's gaze softened, a flicker of vulnerability crossing his features. \\\"The Shadow King stirs, his darkness threatening to consume all. Balance hangs by a thread, and I... I am torn between duty and desire.\\\"\\n\\nThe words hung in the air, a confession wrapped in ambiguity. Evelyn sensed the conflict within him, a battle between light and shadow that mirrored her own quest for meaning. As they stood amidst the whispering trees, the forest seemed to hold its breath, aware of the delicate dance of fate unfolding.\\n\\n\\\"Together, we can restore what is lost,\\\" Evelyn offered, her determination a beacon in the encroaching gloom. \\\"But first, we must understand the choices that lie before us.\\\"\\n\\nFinn nodded, a silent agreement forged in the crucible of uncertainty. In that moment, their destinies intertwined, bound by the promise of redemption and the hope of a world reborn. Yet, beneath the surface, the Shadow King's presence loomed, a reminder that the path to balance was fraught with peril and the echoes of choices yet to be made.\\n```\\n\\noverall plan\\n```\\n{'id': '', 'task_type': 'write', 'goal': 'Write a fairy story for adult.

Her days blurred into one another, a ceaseless cycle of deadlines and edits, each manuscript a mirror reflecting her own unfulfilled dreams. The city, with its towering skyscrapers and bustling streets, felt like a cage, its iron bars forged from routine and repetition.\\n\\nEvelyn, a woman of thirty-two autumns, possessed an insatiable curiosity that simmered beneath her composed exterior. Her heart yearned for the thrill of discovery, for the kind of adventure that her well-worn novels whispered of. Yet, reality kept her tethered to her desk, her world confined to the pages she meticulously curated.\\n\\nIt was on a rain-soaked evening, as the city wept and the streets glistened like obsidian, that Evelyn stumbled upon a peculiar bookstore nestled in a forgotten alley.

Each step she took was a dance with the unknown, the air alive with the symphony of rustling leaves and distant whispers. Here, the world was a kaleidoscope of vibrant hues, where sunlight dappled through the canopy, painting the forest floor in patterns of gold and jade.\\n\\nAs Evelyn ventured deeper, the weight of the city fell away, replaced by a sense of belonging she had never known. Her heart, once heavy with the chains of routine, now soared with the promise of adventure. Yet, beneath the surface of this newfound wonder, a tension simmered—a foreboding presence that lingered in the shadows, watching, waiting.\\n\\nIt was amidst this ethereal beauty that Evelyn first encountered Finn.

Upcoming Major Developments\n\nThe legendary rock band MUSE is gearing up for an exciting new chapter with their highly anticipated album \"Eclipse,\" scheduled for release on March 20, 2025 [reference:18]. This announcement has generated significant buzz among fans worldwide, as it marks their first studio release since the successful \"Will of the People\" in 2022.\n\nThe band's 2025 world tour plans are taking shape, with an impressive lineup of performances scheduled across multiple continents. The tour will strategically coincide with the release of \"Eclipse,\" allowing fans to experience the new material live alongside classic favorites [reference:18]. The production promises to maintain MUSE's reputation for groundbreaking live performances, featuring their signature combination of theatrical elements and cutting-edge technology.\n\nFestival appearances for 2025 showcase MUSE's continued dominance in the live music scene. A particularly noteworthy highlight is their headlining slot at the Pinkpop Festival in Landgraaf, Netherlands, on June 22, 2025 - marking their triumphant return to the festival after a decade-long absence [reference:20]. The band is also confirmed for several other major European festivals, including Rockfest in Finland, Hellfest in France, Tons of Rock in Oslo, Norway, and STHLM Fields in Stockholm, Sweden [reference:21,25].\n\nLooking further ahead, MUSE has already begun laying groundwork for their next album, targeted for release in 2026. Chris Wolstenholme recently revealed that the band plans to commence work on this project \"in the next couple of months\" [reference:24], suggesting an ambitious creative period ahead for the group.\n\n## 2. Recent Album Success - \"Will of the People\"\n\n\"Will of the People,\" released on August 26, 2022, represents a significant milestone in MUSE's career [reference:1]. The album made history as the first to qualify for charts as an NFT, available in limited copies for £20 [reference:1]. Self-produced by the band - their first such effort since \"The 2nd Law\" in 2012 - the album was recorded across multiple prestigious locations, including Red Room in Santa Monica, Black Lodge in London, and the iconic Abbey Road Studios [reference:1,5].\n\nCommercially, the album has been a resounding success. It became MUSE's seventh consecutive UK number-one album, with impressive first-week sales of 51,500 units [reference:1]. The album's global reach was equally impressive, achieving top positions in multiple countries including Australia, Austria, France, and Italy [reference:2]. By January 2023, global sales had exceeded 300,000 units, earning platinum certification in France and gold status in the UK [reference:1].\n\nCritical reception has been largely positive, with the album receiving a Metacritic score of 71 out of 100 based on 14 professional reviews [reference:1]. Notable praise came from various publications, with Kerrang! awarding it 4/5 stars and Riff Magazine giving it an impressive 9/10 rating. NME particularly lauded it as \"the best music in these years\" [reference:1,3].\n\n## 3. Recent Tours and Performances\n\nThe Will of the People World Tour 2023 has been a spectacular showcase of MUSE's live prowess. The US arena tour kicked off at Chicago's United Center on February 25, 2023, featuring supporting acts Evanescence and One Ok Rock [reference:13]. Memorable performances included shows at Madison Square Garden and the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles, where the band delivered extensive 22-song setlists [reference:11,14].\n\nThe European and Asian legs of the tour were equally impressive, with standout performances at iconic venues like Rome's Stadio Olimpico and London's O2 Arena [reference:9]. The shows have consistently featured elaborate production elements, including a square main stage with catwalk, transparent floor for lighting effects, and custom costumes including masks for specific songs [reference:13].\n\n## 4. Band Members' Activities\n\nChris Wolstenholme has embarked on an exciting new venture with his \"Chromes\" project, releasing two debut singles: \"Imaginary World\" and \"The Good Life\" [reference:25]. This marks his first major project as frontman and lyricist since his contributions to MUSE's \"The 2nd Law\" [reference:25].\n\nMatt Bellamy has been balancing personal and professional developments, recently welcoming his second child while also creating a musical score for Audible's adaptation of George Orwell's \"1984\" [reference:23]. He has also been engaging in public discourse, sharing his perspectives on \"Meta-Centrism\" and various social issues [reference:23].\n\n## 5. Future Outlook and Current Status\n\nMUSE currently stands at an interesting crossroads, operating as an unsigned band while exploring future label options [reference:23,24]. Despite this transition period, their creative output remains strong, with multiple projects in development. The band's current direction suggests a balance between maintaining their signature sound while continuing to push boundaries both musically and technologically. With two albums planned for the next two years and an extensive touring schedule, MUSE appears poised for another exciting chapter in their illustrious career.\n</article>"}}], "add_time": "2025-03-14_17:36:10", "hint": "{\n  \"model\": \"claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022\",\n  \"messages\": [\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"\\nThe collaborative report-writing requirement to be completed:  \\n**What's new about the rock band MUSE?

This should include challenges, learning experiences, and a satisfying resolution.\n   - **Setting Design**: Develop a vibrant and imaginative setting that will captivate a child's imagination.

A high-level plan tailored to the user's novel-writing needs is already in place, and your task is to further recursively plan the specified writing sub-tasks within this framework. Through your planning, the resulting novel will strictly adhere to user requirements and achieve perfection in terms of plot, creativity (ideas, themes, and topics), and development.\\n\\n1. Continue the recursive planning for the specified professional novel-writing sub-tasks. According to narrative theory, the organization of story writing and the result of the design tasks, break the tasks down into more granular writing sub-tasks, specifying their scope and specific writing content.  \\n2. Plan design sub-tasks as needed to assist and support specific writing. Design sub-tasks can include designing core conflicts, character settings, outlines and detailed outlines, key story beats, story backgrounds, plot elements, etc., to support the actual writing.  \\n3. For each task, plan a sub-task DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), where the edges represent dependency relationships between design tasks within the same layer of the DAG. Recursively plan each sub-task until all sub-tasks are atomic tasks.\\n\\n# Task Types\\n## Writing (Core, actual writing)\\n- **Function**: Perform actual novel-writing tasks in sequence according to the plan. Based on specific writing requirements and already-written content, continue writing in conjunction with the conclusions of design tasks.  \\n- **All writing tasks are continuation tasks**: Ensure continuity with the preceding content during planning. Writing tasks should flow smoothly and seamlessly with one another.  \\n- **Breakable tasks**: Writing, Design  \\n- Unless necessary, each writing sub-task should be > 500 words.\\n\\n## Design\\n- **Function**: Analyze and design any novel-writing needs other than actual writing. This includes but is not limited to designing core conflicts, character settings, outlines and detailed outlines, key story beats, story backgrounds, plot elements, etc., to support the actual writing.  \\n- **Breakable tasks**: Design  \\n\\n# Information Provided to You\\n- **`Already-written novel content`**: Content from previous writing tasks that has already been written.  \\n- **`Overall plan`**: The overall writing plan, which specifies the task you need to plan through the `is_current_to_plan_task` key.  \\n- **`Results of design tasks completed in higher-level tasks`**  \\n- **`Results of design tasks dependent on the same-layer DAG tasks`**  \\n- **`Writing tasks that require further planning`**  \\n- **`Reference planning`**: A planning sample is provided, which you may cautiously reference.  \\n\\n# Planning Tips\\n1. The last sub-task derived from a writing task must always be a writing task.  \\n2. Reasonably control the number of sub-tasks in each layer of the DAG, generally 3–5 sub-tasks. If the number of tasks exceeds this, aim to plan recursively.  \\n3. **Design tasks** can serve as **sub-tasks of writing tasks**, and as many design sub-tasks as possible should be generated to enhance the quality of writing.  \\n4. Use `dependency` to list the IDs of design tasks within the same-layer DAG. List all potential dependencies as comprehensively as possible.  \\n5. When a design sub-task involves designing specific writing structures (e.g., plot design), subsequent dependent writing tasks should not be laid out flat but should await recursive planning in subsequent rounds.  \\n6. **Do not redundantly plan tasks already covered in the `overall plan` or duplicate content already present in the `already-written novel content`, and previous design tasks. ** \\n7. Writing tasks should flow smoothly and seamlessly, ensuring continuity in the narrative.\\n8. Following the Results of design tasks\\n\\n# Task Attributes\\n1. **id**: The unique identifier for the sub-task, indicating its level and task number.  \\n2. **goal**: A precise and complete description of the sub-task goal in string format.  \\n3. **dependency**: A list of design task IDs from the same-layer DAG that this task depends on. List all potential dependencies as comprehensively as possible. If there are no dependent sub-tasks, this should be empty.  \\n4. **task_type**: A string indicating the type of task. Writing tasks are labeled as `write`, and design tasks are labeled as `think`.  \\n5. **length**: For writing tasks, this attribute specifies the scope, it is required for writing task. Design tasks do not require this attribute.  \\n6. **sub_tasks**: A JSON list representing the sub-task DAG. Each element in the list is a JSON object representing a task.\\n\\n\\n# Example\\n\\n<example index=1>\\nUser-given writing task:\\n{\\n    \\\"id\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n    \\\"task_type\\\": \\\"write\\\",\\n    \\\"goal\\\": \\\"Create an excellent suspense story set in the colony on Europa (Jupiter’s moon), incorporating the real environmental characteristics of Europa.
