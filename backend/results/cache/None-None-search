In my world, this is an opportunity to think about the care continuum and how we can foster strong clinician-patient relationships, build on achievements and address areas that need improvement.\nThe healthcare sector is constantly evolving, with advancements largely driven by technology—particularly AI—alongside a heightened emphasis on patient-centered care. As AI continues its integration into healthcare, the conversation has shifted from potential to practical impact as we gain a clearer understanding of its advantages and challenges. In 2025, healthcare organizations and technology companies should consider these three things when embracing AI and generative AI (GenAI) to support a more efficient, accurate and patient-centered ecosystem.\nAI Hitting The Mark In Some Areas Of Healthcare\nWhen considering the integration of technology in healthcare, the priority is ensuring that clinicians receive the right information, in the right channels, at the right time. Clinicians seek speed when it comes to accessing accurate information and answers, as delays can directly impact care and, ultimately, patient outcomes. These fundamental principles help maximize the relevance and impact of clinical decision support, ensuring that information is received in a clear, actionable way at the moment when it’s needed most.\nAI has identified new opportunities for healthcare organizations, and the focus has been on assessing how we’re adding value today. The applications are broad, from streamlining non-clinical administrative tasks to serving as a second set of eyes in the diagnostic process and lowering operational costs, among other things–all with an eye toward enhancing efficiencies and helping clinicians. Looking ahead, with care teams managing more patients than ever, dependable tools that help them with clinical decision making will be invaluable and should continue to be a focus.\nA Bright Spot: Alleviating Clinician Burnout\nAI holds significant potential in helping reduce clinician burnout, which remains a critical issue driving the healthcare workforce shortage. Burnout contributes to high turnover rates, which places greater strain on the remaining staff, perpetuating the cycle. For patients, clinician burnout can lead to decreased quality of care, longer wait times and increased healthcare costs.\nImproving day-to-day workflows to maximize clinician efficiency is key. Health systems can enhance provider satisfaction by reducing time-consuming tasks such as notetaking, reimbursement, and documentation, therefore reducing pajama time or after-hours work. Intuitive, contextual and responsible content enhances provider satisfaction and enables effective patient communication. For example, ambient AI and other clinician benefits like EHR UI applications have been recognized as game-changers for clinicians. I believe these solutions will continue to evolve in the coming year and show promise in enabling better patient-clinician interactions and combating burnout.\nThe Path To Clinical Readiness For GenAI\nGenAI shows potential for supporting clinical decisions, yet its full adoption depends on healthcare providers’ confidence in the reliability and rigor of its underlying data and recommendations. I don't see this confidence quite there yet in the patient care setting, as there are reliability concerns relating to underlying content sets. In one survey, 91% of U.S. physicians indicated wanting to know clinical AI is sourced from medical experts. GenAI inaccuracies, or \"hallucinations\"—where models may produce incorrect or misleading information—underscore the need for reliable data and precision with a human in the loop.\nConcerns are likely to arise the closer GenAI gets to the patient in the care continuum. Provider hesitancy reflects the priority for high-quality, consistent information that meets the critical standards required in patient care, which begins by identifying what responsible GenAI looks like. We must balance our excitement with caution when it comes to implementing GenAI in a healthcare setting. Human involvement builds patient trust, which is a vital component of patient adherence and satisfaction. Trusted clinical decision support content, when combined with active clinician involvement, is the only way forward.\nConclusion\nOverall, I've noticed a general sense of optimism about the future of technology in healthcare. Realizing the benefits of AI in its various forms will rely on exploring current perceptions and taking advantage of opportunities to build trust in, and understanding of, this evolving technology.\nAs we embrace the innovations sparked by technology, the dual benefits of time savings and improved accuracy will work to enhance the landscape of patient care, paving the way for a more efficient and effective healthcare environment. The focus on reliable clinical decision support tools in 2025 will be a vital component to improving care for all.\nReal action is needed from the entire healthcare ecosystem to develop and adopt tools that maintain clinical excellence while prioritizing innovative collaborations.

Here’s what to expect in 2025.\nContent: From Point Solutions to Operational Transformation\n\"We're witnessing a fundamental shift in how AI is deployed in healthcare,\" explains Neil Patel, Head of Ventures. \"The technology is moving beyond basic automation toward truly autonomous systems capable of handling complex operational workflows end-to-end. What's particularly exciting is how voice AI is evolving to support natural clinician-patient conversations while simultaneously managing documentation and providing real-time clinical decision support.\"\nThis evolution is particularly evident in how data is being integrated and utilized. Multiple streams of information – imaging, lab results, patient history, and real-time monitoring – are being unified into cohesive systems that drive more informed clinical decisions.\nLindsey Rogers, Director of New Ventures, has observed a significant expansion in AI applications beyond traditional use cases. \"Early adopters focused on obvious opportunities like call center optimization and scheduling,\" she notes. \"But in 2025, we're seeing entirely new applications emerge. Companies are using AI to evaluate the robustness of clinical studies, predict hospital supply chain needs with unprecedented accuracy, and provide practice owners with sophisticated operational insights drawn from vast amounts of previously unstructured data.\"\n\"We're witnessing a fundamental shift in how AI is deployed in healthcare.\"\nThe Changing Investment Landscape\nThe venture landscape in healthcare is experiencing a notable shift. \"Traditional venture firms are becoming increasingly selective about early-stage investments,\" Patel observes. \"They're focusing primarily on AI-enabled companies that can demonstrate immediate impact, while specialist healthcare funds are emerging as the primary backers of tech-enabled services companies.\"\nThis bifurcation is creating fascinating market dynamics. Early-stage companies leveraging AI are achieving significant milestones with far less capital than their predecessors. Meanwhile, Rogers points out a crucial challenge facing established players: \"Incumbent and later-stage companies with significant technical debt – sophisticated technology stacks not designed to be AI-native – are beginning to lose major business to earlier stage competitors who can offer more customized solutions at better price points.\"\nWorkforce Innovation and Clinical Impact\nThe healthcare workforce is undergoing its own revolution. Ryan Schneiter, Managing Director of New Ventures, sees AI technology reshaping how risk-bearing providers approach health outcomes. \"We're seeing providers leverage AI for better risk stratification, improved preventative clinical interventions, and enhanced physician productivity,\" he explains. \"The technology is moving beyond simple task automation to fundamentally changing how clinical teams operate.\"\nThe financial implications are significant, particularly in Revenue Cycle Management. \"The true ROI breakthrough lies in AI-driven tools that streamline billing, claims processing, and documentation verification,\" Patel notes. \"Health systems with significant operational expenses in clinical and non-clinical labor stand to gain substantially from AI adoption, both for productivity gains and, where appropriate, labor optimization.\"\nRegulatory Considerations\nAs AI becomes more deeply integrated into care delivery and clinical decision support, new challenges are emerging. \"Software-as-a-medical-device requirements have come into increased focus,\" Schneiter emphasizes. \"These requirements will continue to shape how companies approach building AI products and solutions, adding an important layer of complexity to innovation in this space.\"\nLooking Ahead\nAs we move into 2025, the focus will be on meaningful integration of these emerging technologies. Rogers is particularly optimistic about new opportunities: \"As founders and investors better understand AI's capabilities, we expect to see AI enter new healthcare markets with novel offerings while creating new opportunities in traditional sectors where innovation had reached a ceiling without large language models.\"\nThe challenge for healthcare organizations won't be finding AI solutions – it will be selecting the right ones and implementing them effectively. \"Success will require not just technological adoption but thoughtful integration that considers workforce impact, clinical workflows, and patient outcomes,\" Patel explains. \"The organizations that succeed will be those that can navigate this transformation while keeping sight of healthcare's fundamental mission: improving patient outcomes and expanding access to care.\"\nWe continue to be excited by the opportunities ahead and look forward to partnering with innovative companies that are thoughtfully approaching these challenges.", "select_response": "<think>\nThe webpage discusses the imminent transformation of healthcare operations due to AI technologies, focusing on various aspects of AI's applications in healthcare.

From my vantage point as a physician who helps develop healthcare technology and whose company offers a telehealth solution, I expect five trends will significantly impact healthcare delivery in the coming year.\n1. Telehealth and hospital-at-home programs will continue to transform how we deliver healthcare.\nIt’s been over a year since the public health emergency officially ended, and telemedicine continues to play an active role in U.S. healthcare. From chronic disease management to acute care delivered directly in patients’ homes, telemedicine has become a valuable complement to in-person care. Doximity research shows that 89% of physicians surveyed believe telemedicine has increased patient access to healthcare, with many reporting better disease management, improved patient outcomes and satisfaction, and equivalent or superior adherence to treatment plans.\nWhile in-person care remains a cornerstone of healthcare delivery, I believe telemedicine and hospital-at-home programs will continue to serve as a vital extension to this care, offering enhanced flexibility and continuity. This will be particularly important as the U.S. continues to confront an aging and growing patient population amid an intensifying physician shortage.\n2. AI hype will give way to practical applications.\nInterest in artificial intelligence (AI) has exploded in recent years, generating both excitement and a healthy dose of skepticism. While the potential of AI in healthcare is undeniable, 2025 could be the year when the hype settles and applications that provide real-world, practical value will stand out.\nPhysicians across the nation still face high levels of job stress and burnout. When asked how burnout and overwork could be alleviated, 75% of physicians surveyed by our company cited reducing administrative burden—an area where AI can truly shine.\nIn 2025, pragmatic AI solutions that automate administrative tasks, enhance clinical decision-making and predict patient outcomes will showcase their value. Companies prioritizing AI tools that streamline clinical workflows and enhance, rather than attempt to replace, clinicians' expertise could emerge as leaders.\nThis recalibration of AI's role in healthcare is mission-critical for fostering trust and adoption. With fewer, but more reliable, AI tools at our disposal, physicians can focus on delivering high-quality, efficient care while making the most of AI's current capabilities.\n3. As direct-to-consumer pharma models rise, physicians will remain central to care.\nAnother significant trend to watch in 2025 is the continued movement of large pharmaceutical companies into the direct-to-consumer (D2C) space—a shift that could have profound implications for healthcare delivery.\nWhile D2C models can empower patients by giving them greater access to medications (potentially at lower costs) and more control over their healthcare choices, some patients may need more holistic, comprehensive counseling that considers their overall health, coexisting conditions and broader treatment goals. There is also the risk of worsening the fragmentation of care in our system.\nI believe this trend will prompt a reevaluation of physicians' role in medication management and undoubtedly place a greater responsibility on the medical workforce to stay informed. Additionally, this could open up new opportunities for digital tools that enhance communication between patients, providers and pharmacies and allow physicians to monitor their patients' medication use remotely.\n4. New approaches to pain management could thrive.\nI have a sensitivity to NSAIDs and recently found myself having conversations with my doctor about how to best manage acute back pain from a herniated disk. Even as a physician, I struggled with the fact that there are not many options for someone like me beyond Tylenol, which I’m already using, and opioids, which I would like to avoid.\nThe scars left by the opioid epidemic have fundamentally altered pain management in the U.S. Many healthcare systems have (appropriately, in my opinion) implemented stricter guidelines for prescribing opioids, but patients still need effective pain relief. The availability of new, safer options could be transformative.\nIn 2025, I expect that there will be a stronger focus on developing safer, effective alternatives for pain management. I believe innovations in non-opioid pharmaceuticals, neuromodulation and regenerative medicine hold promise.\nStill, there will be challenges. Healthcare systems must prepare for an increased demand for new alternative treatments while also ensuring we do not repeat the mistakes of the past, including underestimating the potential risks of new treatments.\n5. Remote patient monitoring could find a role in mainstream care.\nOne of the most exciting developments of 2025 will likely be the continued advancement of remote patient monitoring (RPM). The pandemic accelerated the need for RPM technologies, and they have since become a more integral part of chronic disease management, post-operative care and preventive medicine.\nAs these technologies improve, the implications for healthcare delivery are profound. Physicians can now monitor patients in real time, collect valuable data on their health status, and intervene earlier if problems arise. This could not only improve patient outcomes but also reduce the burden on overtaxed healthcare systems, potentially keeping more patients out of hospitals and emergency departments.\nIn 2025, I think we will see further integration of RPM into mainstream healthcare, driven by advancements in sensor technology, data analytics and interoperability. The expansion of 5G networks will also play a critical role by enabling better connectivity for patients in rural or remote areas. Healthcare providers will need to adapt by developing more robust protocols for handling vast amounts of patient data and integrating these insights into clinical decision-making—tasks made much more achievable with AI.\nConclusion: Change is inevitable, and so is progress.\nMany factors are poised to shape our healthcare system in 2025—some of which we cannot yet foresee. What is clear is that healthcare will continue on a path toward greater innovation and patient empowerment.\nAs a physician, I am optimistic that these changes will ultimately improve patient care. The challenges ahead are real, but so are the opportunities. By staying adaptable, embracing new technologies and advocating for patient-centered care, we can emerge stronger as a healthcare system.\nForbes Business Council is the foremost growth and networking organization for business owners and leaders.

She’s one of several Wolters Kluwer thought leaders quoted in the post.\nAll the contributors set expectations for healthcare AI in 2025. Here are five key excerpts.\n1. The next 12 months are likely to set the stage for incremental—as opposed to abrupt—change.\n“Implementation of new federal and agency policies will take time,” predicts Peter Bonis, MD, Wolters Kluwer Health’s chief medical officer. “Advancement in AI applications will continue to be constrained by workflow, competing priorities and economic considerations driving uptake.” More from Bonis:\n‘The greatest progress at scale will likely continue to be in AI applications that drive revenue optimization, although some technologies like ambient listening will make progress due to their immediate promise to streamline workflow and document pain points.’\n2. The success of clinical GenAI will largely depend on the degree to which it incorporates the human touch.\n“GenAI is positioned to play a role in improving patient care in 2025, but more work needs to be done to improve consistency and ensure that patients receive the highest quality care,” states Wolters Kluwer Health’s CEO for clinical effectiveness, Greg Samios. “This starts by defining responsible GenAI so that we can enhance efficiency and reach our destination of superior patient outcomes.” More from Samios:\n‘When thinking about the year ahead, I believe we can’t lose sight of the human touch or the quality interactions and trusted data that help push us forward.’\n3. AI and VR will rewrite how future nurses prepare to practice.\n“In 2025, the fusion of AI and virtual reality will transform how students, residents, researchers and new-to-practice providers, nurses and healthcare professionals develop essential skills,” forecasts Julie Stegman, Wolters Kluwer Health’s VP of health learning and practice. “By integrating AI and VR, healthcare educators can create immersive learning environments, personalized learning paths and real-world simulations that mirror what life will be like when caring for patients.” More from Stegman:\n‘These expert solutions can help decrease the time it takes to onboard and ease the transition growing pains that new employees can face.’\n4. AI will improve healthcare ‘one second at a time.’\n“I anticipate we’ll see an increase in innovation and integrations to bring evidence-based recommendations directly into the clinical workflow,” predicts Wolters Kluwer Health product & solutions VP Yaw Fellin, “reducing the number of clicks needed to improve documentation, provide patient education and receive clinical decision support.” More Fellin:\n‘Just a few seconds can make all the difference in healthcare, and with each click saved, we can significantly reduce the cognitive burden on our healthcare professionals and foster more meaningful interactions with patients.’\n5. GenAI may—just may—deliver measurable ROI for healthcare in 2025.\n“In 2025, GenAI in healthcare needs to shift from potential to practical value, focusing on delivering tangible benefits for professionals and patients in the system,” writes Holly Urban, MD, Wolters Kluwer Health’s VP for business development. “With this transition from hype cycle to value cycle we will continue to see focus on how GenAI can reduce some of the administrative burden of providers with tools such as ambient scribes.” More from Urban:\n‘Improved efficiency is always a top priority with healthcare leaders, but the continuing friction between payers and providers—coupled with potential regulatory changes with the new [Trump] administration—will make this focus even sharper.

Introduction\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare, exploiting machine learning (ML) algorithms, data analytics, and automation, is enduring a paradigm transition by improving medical decision‐making, diagnosis, and treatment outcomes, with the potential to boost productivity, care quality, and ease costs [1]. The delivery, administration, and patient experience of healthcare are all being completely transformed by the advancement of AI‐driven technology and further its integration into existing systems [2, 3]. This in‐depth study looks at how AI is significantly impacting the healthcare sector, improving diagnostic precision through data analysis, streamlining treatment planning through predictive algorithms, and shedding light on how these advancements are challenging accepted wisdom and setting new benchmarks for quality [3, 4, 5]. Najjar (2023) showcased AI's revolutionary potential in several healthcare sectors. In diagnostics, AI‐powered diagnostic tools have shown remarkable accuracy in diagnosing diseases including cancer, heart issues, and neurological disorders, particularly in the area of medical imaging. These technologies frequently outperform human clinicians in this regard [6]. Their speed and precision have frequently surpassed that of human professionals. ML algorithms scan vast amounts of data from imaging studies, genomes, and medical records to identify patterns and predict patient outcomes, enabling earlier and more accurate diagnosis [4]. In addition to improving patient outcomes, AI‐powered expertise enables personalized treatment plans that cater to each patient's unique requirements and boost the effectiveness of treatments [5, 6]. By analyzing patient data to suggest tailored medication, AI improves treatment success and minimizes side effects [4, 5, 6]. These technologies can reduce hospital admissions and readmissions by remotely monitoring patients and alerting medical professionals to issues before they get worse [2, 3]. According to Alowais et al. (2023), AI is also greatly enhancing patient care and administrative effectiveness. Virtual health assistants driven by ML and NLP are increasingly being used to plan appointments, handle patient communications, and provide medical advice, all of which reduce the workload for medical staff [7]. Healthcare facilities operate more effectively, and resources are directed where they are most needed because to AI's capacity to manage massive information and optimize workflows [7]. By optimizing treatment plans, getting rid of unnecessary procedures, and improving diagnosis accuracy, AI has the potential to significantly reduce healthcare expenditures. Bajwa et. al. (2021) touched on one of the main factors influencing AI's adoption is its ability to lower healthcare expenses [1]. One of the primary drivers of AI adoption, according to Bajwa et al. (2021), is its potential to reduce healthcare costs [1]. Predictive analytics is a significant use of AI in healthcare that supports patient demand forecasting, population health management, and resource allocation. Since early detection and tailored treatment can prevent costly outcomes and hospital admissions, these qualities are particularly beneficial in the management of chronic illnesses [1, 3, 7].\nAI in healthcare must overcome several significant challenges if it is to live up to its full potential. Ethical concerns such as safeguarding patient privacy and avoiding bias in AI systems must be taken into consideration. There are concerns about data security and potential misuse because AI systems rely on massive amounts of data [3]. To ensure that the highest safety and efficacy standards are fulfilled and to oversee the development and use of AI technology in healthcare, robust regulatory frameworks are also necessary [8].\nAdditionally, for the healthcare industry to adopt AI, a cultural shift must occur. By automating processes like scheduling, billing, and patient triage and allocating resources optimally to cut down on wait times and enhance workflow overall, AI also increases operational competence [1, 3, 5]. Healthcare professionals must understand the benefits and drawbacks of AI technology and be ready to handle them. Collaboration between AI developers, healthcare practitioners, and legislators is essential to the development of systems that are not just technologically advanced but also aligned with the needs and values of patients and providers [7]. To enable prompt reactions, AI‐driven surveillance systems use ML algorithms to identify trends and early warning indicators of disease outbreaks [9, 58]. AI models forecast epidemics and track the spread of diseases like influenza, monkeypox, chikungunya and COVID‐19 by analyzing symptoms, travel records, and environmental data [6, 7, 8], helping public health officials allocate resources, implement prevention strategies, and tackle emergent health threats [3, 7].\nAt the outset, AI is more than just a technological advancement—it is what is propelling the advancement of healthcare. Its capacity to transform patient care, diagnostics, and operational effectiveness offers hope for a more individualized, effective, and accessible healthcare system in the future [8]. As AI develops, ethical, legal, and cultural issues must be carefully considered before integrating it into the healthcare industry. By overcoming these obstacles, AI can live up to its potential of revolutionizing healthcare into a more efficient and just system where human judgment and technological know‐how combine to provide better treatment [3, 7].\nThis review provides a comprehensive analysis of AI's implications for the healthcare sector, emphasizing how it affects operational effectiveness, treatment planning, and diagnosis. The following important sections make up the structure of the manuscript. The methodology is described in Section 2, which also includes information on the databases, keywords, inclusion/exclusion criteria, data extraction, and synthesis used in this investigation. Understanding AI in healthcare is examined in Section 3, market dynamics and the development of AI throughout time are examined in Section 4, and the use of AI in the healthcare industry is examined in Section 5. Recognizing the market dynamics, the growth of AI over time, and the critical role it has played in diagnostics, operational effectiveness, and patient care. While Section 7 concentrates on the main obstacles and worries regarding the deployment of AI in healthcare, Section 6 emphasizes the advantages of AI in the healthcare industry. Together with its disadvantages, which include ethical concerns, data privacy issues, and legal challenges, the benefits of AI, such as improved outcomes and reduced expenses have been examined. The current uses of AI in healthcare are reviewed in Section 8, and Section 9 looks at possible future developments and their ramifications. Additionally, several real‐world examples are provided, along with forecasts on future trends and implications, such as the possible impact of AI on healthcare and its continued integration.\n2.

Understanding Al in Healthcare\nAI is a disruptive force in the healthcare industry that involves novel ideas and changes in conventional methods. This section provides a thorough overview of AI in healthcare, including everything from its basic description to its current acceptance status [1, 3].\n3.1. What Is Al in Healthcare?\nThe development of computer systems capable of carrying out operations often associated with human intellect is known as AI. Within the healthcare domain, AI manifests through diverse modalities, including ML algorithms, NLP and robotics [4, 5]. These technological facets collectively empower machines to scrutinize intricate medical data, discern patterns, and render informed decisions. In effect, AI serves as a transformative augmentation of healthcare professionals’ capabilities [1, 5, 6]. AI in healthcare is a paradigm change that affects patient interaction, treatment plans, administrative procedures, and diagnosis. Improving patient outcomes, optimizing healthcare delivery, and raising the standard of care are the main objectives. AI is a flexible toolset rather than a single fix, providing a range of applications that address various facets of the healthcare environment [3, 4, 7].\n3.2. Types of Al in Healthcare\nML algorithms are essential to the healthcare industry because they make it easier to identify patterns and trends in large datasets. Another aspect of AI is NLP, which enables robots to understand and communicate with human language. This makes it easier to perform activities like voice‐activated devices or language‐based data analysis. Robots, a kind of AI, are used in healthcare through automated procedures and hands‐on support during procedures or patient care [6]. The hierarchical structure and interdependencies between AI, ML, and DL are depicted in Figure 2. As general AI concepts give way to the next generation of advanced, data‐driven learning performances, the correlations show how specificity and complexity increase from AI to DL.\nAI in healthcare comes in a variety of forms, each intended for a specific use. Rule‐based systems, for instance, make decisions based on preset criteria and are suitable for tasks like symptom screening [3, 4]. On the other hand, because ML algorithms can spot patterns in data, they are crucial for customized treatment regimens and diagnostic imaging. Applications like voice recognition and chatbots are made possible by NLP's facilitation of human‐computer communication [8]. Robotics is another area of AI that has applications in physical therapy and surgery. This demonstrates the range and complexity of AI's uses in healthcare [5].\nAI's rapid and accurate analysis of complicated medical data presents a promising path toward more accurate, data‐driven decision‐making in the healthcare industry, which will ultimately lead to better patient care and results [1, 5].\n3.3. Current State of Al Adoption in Healthcare\nAI's application in healthcare is being propelled by growing awareness of its potential benefits, data abundance, and technological advancements [3, 4]. In diagnostics, AI‐powered tools, such as X‐rays and MRIs, demonstrate remarkable accuracy in interpreting medical images, often outperforming traditional methods [6, 9]. Treatment personalization, leveraging ML algorithms, allows for tailored approaches based on individual patient profiles, optimizing therapeutic interventions [3, 10]. Administrative functions, including revenue cycle management and supply chain optimization, involve witnessing efficiency gains through AI‐driven automation [3]. Table 2 provides a crisp overview of each AI approach, including their applications, advantages, disadvantages, and references, offering a clearer understanding of their potential application and challenges in healthcare.\nTable 2.\n| AI/ML models [Ref.] | Details & application | Benefit | Drawback |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [61] | Through the creation of new chemical structures, or GANs, are essential to the development of medicinal products. They are made up of a discriminator network for assessing quality and a generator network for generating compounds, which together enable the production of many, well‐suited therapeutic candidates. |\n|\n|\n| Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) [54] | In drug discovery, RNNs are widely employed for tasks such as protein structure prediction, genomic data analysis, and peptide sequence design. RNNs are particularly good at identifying sequential relationships and creating new sequences based on patterns they have learned. |\n|\n|\n| Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) [41, 57] | CNNs are an effective tool for image‐based applications including drug target identification and chemical structure analysis. They take relevant information out of molecular pictures to help in target identification and medication design. |\n|\n|\n| Long short‐Term Memory Networks (LSTMs) [35] | Modeling and forecasting temporal relationships is a strong suit for RNN subtypes called LSTMs. They are useful for forecasting drug concentration‐time profiles, evaluating drug effectiveness, and conducting pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics research. |\n|\n|\n| Transformer Models (TMs) [43, 67] | TMs are used for NLP jobs in the pharmaceutical area, such as the popular BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model. They help researchers make well‐informed judgments on the development of new drugs by extracting important information from databases of patents, clinical trial data, and scientific literature. |\n|\n|\n| Reinforcement Learning (RL) [26] | Personalized treatment plans and optimal drug dosage methods are achieved through the application of RL approaches. By generating consecutive judgments that improve dosage optimization and patient outcomes, RL algorithms learn from interactions with the environment. |\n|\n|\n| Bayesian Models (BMs) [37, 44, 59, 71] | In drug development, BMs, such as Gaussian processes and Bayesian networks, are essential for quantifying uncertainty and making decisions. For researchers in the field, they aid in risk assessment, experimental design optimization, and probabilistic forecasts. |\n|\n|\n| Deep Q‐Networks (DQNs) [38, 49] | Drug discovery is optimized by applying DQNs, which combine RL and DL. By predicting chemical activity and suggesting promising candidates for additional testing, they improve the efficiency of the drug discovery process. |\n|\n|\n| Autoencoders (AEs) [32] | In drug development, AEs—unsupervised learning models are used for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction. They help with virtual screening and compound screening procedures by capturing important molecular features. |\n|\n|\n| Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) [55, 66] | Because they are designed to handle graph‐structured data, GNNs are perfect for drug discovery applications that involve chemical structures. They aid in de novo drug creation and virtual screening processes, efficiently model molecular graphs, and forecast features. |\n|\n|\nHowever, the current state of AI adoption is not without challenges. Although progressive businesses and important healthcare facilities welcome AI, obstacles to its broad adoption include a lack of resources, worries about data security, and the need for extensive legal frameworks [11, 12]. As technology advances, cooperation between software developers, medical practitioners, and government agencies is necessary to guarantee the appropriate and efficient application of AI [1, 5, 11]. Recognizing AI's diversity, ranging from complex ML algorithms to rule‐based systems, is essential for comprehending its application in healthcare [4, 5]. A summary of AI applications in healthcare shows how the technology has the potential to completely transform the sector, and the adoption process now reflects both advancements and challenges [3, 7]. To fully realize the promise of AI for improving healthcare delivery, we must continue to explore and collaborate as we traverse this revolutionary terrain [1, 4].\n4.

A medical diagnosis is the identification of the disease or conditions that cause a person’s symptoms and signs. Usually, the patient’s medical history and physical examination provide diagnostic information. Diagnosing a medical condition can be difficult because many symptoms are ambiguous and can only be correctly identified by trained healthcare professionals. This can be a major problem in developing countries where doctors and other health professionals are scarce. Many people in these countries cannot get proper medical diagnosis and treatment for lack of healthcare professionals [2]. AI could be helpful for undeveloped regions [3]. The AI-based system [4, 5] is able to detect various diseases, such as kidney stone detection [6], heart disease prediction and detection [7], skin and lung cancer detection [8, 9], diabetes prediction and detection [10]. Recently, AI-based systems have played an important role in the correct diagnosis of COVID-19 [11, 12].\nA branch of artificial intelligence called “ML” focuses on creating algorithms that allow computers to learn from data and make predictions. It is based on the idea that systems can automatically get better at a task over time by gaining experience and processing lots of data. Recent advances in ML technology have enabled computers to process and understand information on a par with humans. In some cases, these systems can recognize patterns and extract information with greater accuracy than trained experts. This is a significant step forward, as it demonstrates the ability of machines to process and understand complex information in new and novel ways. ML has become a powerful tool due to improvements in classical statistical modeling techniques, large amounts of data, growth in computing power, and advanced algorithm design [13]. ML algorithms can be trained on large datasets of medical images such as radiographs and MRI scans [14], to identify signs of disease or abnormalities. There are two types of problems in ML, classification and regression. Classification is predicting an outcome from a set of data, while regression is showing the relationship between dependent and independent variables.\nWhile ML algorithms have been proven to be valuable tools in medical diagnosis [15, 16], it is essential to recognize that they should not replace human expertise and judgment. ML algorithms rely on the data they have been trained on and may not consider all relevant factors in the diagnostic process. Additionally, these algorithms are not infallible and can make errors. Therefore, it is crucial for healthcare professionals to exercise caution, review, and verify the results generated by ML systems to ensure accurate and reliable diagnoses. The integration of ML into healthcare can be considered as a collaborative approach that combines the strengths of both algorithms and human expertise to achieve the best possible outcomes for patients.\n1.1 Motivation\nThe main purpose of this thorough review is to provide a helpful guide for upcoming researchers, especially those who want to explore the unused possibilities of using ML for detecting diseases at an early stage. By delving deep into the application of ML algorithms across a diverse spectrum of diseases, this review endeavors to provide critical insights into the most effective strategies for early detection, thereby propelling the realm of medical diagnostics into a new era of precision and proactive care. In this pursuit, the review will address pivotal questions that hold paramount importance for researchers venturing into the realm of ML-powered early disease diagnosis. It is poised to be a beacon, illuminating crucial pathways for researchers seeking to incorporate ML into their diagnostic arsenal. To achieve this, the review will embark on a threefold exploration.\nFirstly, it will chart a comprehensive course through the labyrinth of ML-based methods, guiding researchers in the art of applying these algorithms to diagnose a diverse array of diseases.

Each of these diseases has been chosen with utmost consideration, reflecting their profound impact on humanity. Cancer, an enigmatic adversary with countless faces, strikes fear into hearts and calls for innovative diagnostic solutions. The unprecedented global turmoil wrought by COVID-19 emphasized the urgent need for rapid and accurate diagnostic tools. The stealthy yet devastating kidney disease, the relentless assault of heart disease, and the silent metabolic imbalance of diabetes underline the critical necessity of early detection. By delving into these human dangers, the review seeks to underscore the rationale for their selection and the urgency of pioneering ML-based diagnostic interventions.\nThirdly, the review will delve into the realm of ML algorithms that are being actively employed in the realm of smart medical applications for disease diagnosis. By deciphering the algorithms that have not only demonstrated success in clinical settings but have also been battle-tested in real-world medical scenarios, the review aims to facilitate future researchers in selecting the most appropriate tools for their own diagnostic pursuits. A pivotal focus within this review lies in the rigorous evaluation of algorithmic performance in the context of medical diagnosis. The effectiveness of ML algorithms hinges on their reliability and accuracy, particularly when applied to the complex landscape of healthcare. Consequently, the review will meticulously examine the methodologies and metrics deployed in prior studies to gauge the sufficiency of these evaluation paradigms. The ultimate synthesis of this multifaceted exploration forms a robust foundation for empowering future researchers.

Section 4 discusses the diagnosis of different diseases using ML algorithms. Section 5 presents the details of the publicly available datasets. Section 6 presents research challenges and future perspectives. Section 6 discusses the conclusions of this review.\n2 Background\n2.1 Types of ML\nDiverse categories of ML models exist, encompassing supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning approaches.\nSupervised Learning\nIn this approach, the model is trained on labeled data and makes predictions based on that data. The objective is to establish a mapping function between input and output variables. Supervised learning is commonly used for tasks like image classification, where the model learns from labeled examples to classify new images accurately.\nUnsupervised Learning\nThis category of learning entails training the model using unlabeled data, allowing it to uncover concealed patterns and structures autonomously, devoid of human intervention. Unsupervised learning excels at tasks such as image recognition and clustering, where the model identifies similarities and differences within the data without any prior knowledge of the classes or labels.\nSemi-Supervised Learning\nIn this context, the model undergoes training through a blend of both labeled and unlabeled data sources. The labeled data is used to make predictions, while the unlabeled data aids in enhancing the model’s accuracy and performance. The objective is to harness the wealth of unlabeled data in order to enhance the model’s overall performance, particularly in situations where acquiring labeled data proves expensive or time-intensive.\nReinforcement Learning\nIn the realm of reinforcement learning, an agent acquires knowledge through iterative trial and error engagements with its surroundings. By taking actions and receiving subsequent rewards or penalties contingent on its actions, the agent adapts its decision-making approach to optimize the cumulative reward signal. Reinforcement learning finds applications in various domains, such as robotics, gaming AI, and recommendation systems.\nFigure 1 illustrates the different methods of ML algorithms, depicting the relationships and distinctions among supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning approaches.\n2.1.1 Support Vector Machine (SVM)\nSVM is a ML algorithm used for classification tasks. SVM was introduced in the 20th century by Vanpik [17]. The primary objective of SVM is to identify an optimal hyperplane that effectively divides the gathered data into distinct classes. The space between this hyperplane and the nearest data points from each class is referred to as the support vector. The selection of the hyperplane aims to maximize the margin, denoting the gap between the vector and the hyperplane itself. SVM handles nonlinearly separable data. It transforms the data into a high-dimensional space where linear boundaries can be found.\n2.1.2 Decision Tree (DT)\nA DT is a supervised learning model employed to address both classification and regression tasks. DT follows the divide-and-conquer strategy [18]. DT works by dividing the source data into subsets based on the most significant attributes. This splitting is done in a recursive manner, hence it is called recursive partitioning. Each internal node is characterized as a dataset, with branches representing the decision made and leaves representing the final result or prediction. Decision Trees are popular for modeling and visualizing complex decision-making processes because they are easily interpretable and can handle both categorical and numerical data.\n2.1.3 Naïve Bayes\nNaïve Bayes [19] is a probabilistic ML algorithm that is based on the Bayes theorem. This theorem states that which states that the probability of a hypothesis (e.g., a class label in classification) given observed evidence (e.g., features of an instance) is proportional to the prior probability of the hypothesis and the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.\nThe NB algorithm is used to predict the class label of an instance based on its feature. This model makes a strong assumption of independence between features, which is why it is called naive. This independence assumption doesn’t hold in reality. This algorithm works well when there is high dimensionality and a large amount of data to classify.\n2.1.4 AdaBoost\nAdaBoost, short for Adaptive Boosting, stands as a widely recognized ensemble learning algorithm in ML. It orchestrates the amalgamation of multiple weak models, culminating in the construction of a robust model that contributes to precise predictions. This algorithm gives more weight to the samples that are harder to classify so that the model focuses more on those samples. This process is repeated several times and the weights are updated at each iteration until a satisfactory model is obtained. The final model is a weighted average of the individual weak models [20].\n2.1.5 K-nearest neighbor\nKNN is an ML classification algorithm that assigns a label to a data point based on the majority vote of the K nearest neighbors used for prediction. The algorithm identifies K data points within the training set that exhibit the closest proximity to the new data point. Subsequently, it leverages the class labels of these K neighbors to formulate a prediction. This prediction is determined through a majority vote among the classes of these K neighbors. It is important to choose an appropriate value of K because K has a significant impact on the performance of the algorithm [21].\n2.1.6 Logistic Regression\nLogistic Regression (LR) serves as a statistical model within ML, elucidating the association between a continuous dependent variable and independent variables. The independent variables, often referred to as predictors or features, play the role of prognosticators in anticipating the outcome. LR is used for 2-class classification. It first calculates the linear combination between the independent variables and the coefficient, known as the logit. It then predicts the outcome by transforming the output through a logistic/sigmoid function [22].\n2.2 Deep Learning Overview\nDeep learning (DL) represents a remarkable branch of AI and ML that has garnered significant attention due to its ability to mimic the structure and function of the human brain [23]. It has been demonstrated extraordinary potential in various applications, particularly in fields such as medical disease prediction, computer vision, and decision-making. DL algorithms, built on the concept of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), have proven to be highly effective at learning complex relationships within data and making accurate predictions. The foundation of DL lies in neural networks, which consist of interconnected processing nodes arranged in layers. Each node, or neuron, processes input data and passes the result to subsequent layers, eventually leading to the generation of an output. These networks excel at learning intricate patterns from raw data, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering, a process that traditionally required domain expertise and considerable effort [24]. The process of training DL networks is central to their success. It involves presenting the network with vast amounts of labeled data and adjusting its internal parameters, namely the weights and biases, to minimize prediction errors. This optimization process is typically achieved through gradient descent and backpropagation algorithms, which iteratively fine-tune the model’s parameters until it becomes capable of accurate predictions.\nOne of the most significant breakthroughs facilitated by DL is in the field of medical diagnosis, particularly in medical image processing. By leveraging DL models, researchers and healthcare professionals have made significant strides in diagnosing various medical conditions using different medical imaging modalities, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and chest radiographs [25,26,27,28]. These models have showcased unprecedented accuracy, often outperforming human experts. Despite these accomplishments, DL models in medical diagnosis are still in their early stages and have their limitations. While they excel at accuracy, their interpretability remains a challenge. Understanding the decision-making process of complex neural networks can be elusive, leading to concerns about the transparency and trustworthiness of their results. As such, extensive testing and validation are necessary before these models can be widely integrated into clinical practice. It is essential to interpret their outputs in conjunction with a patient’s medical history and other diagnostic information to ensure precise and reliable diagnoses.\nAs illustrated in Fig. 2, the development of ML and DL has evolved over time, with DL emerging as a powerful extension of ML. The timeline depicts the progress made in both fields, showcasing how DL has transformed various domains and opened up new possibilities for researchers, developers, and practitioners alike. In conclusion, DL stands as a revolutionary advancement in AI and ML. Through its utilization of neural networks and the ability to automatically extract complex patterns from data, DL has enabled breakthroughs in numerous AI applications. In the medical field, DL has shown promise in diagnosing diseases through medical image processing, revolutionizing healthcare practices. However, challenges related to model interpretability and rigorous validation remain critical areas of focus. As researchers continue to explore and refine DL techniques, its impact on AI and diverse industries will undoubtedly continue to be profound, fueling innovation and driving future advancements.\n2.2.1 Convolutional Neural Networks\nCNNs represent a category of powerful DL models, mainly employed for tasks in computer vision. Their applications encompass a wide range of tasks, including image classification and segmentation [29]. They are specifically designed to process visual data efficiently by exploiting the spatial correlations present in images [30]. A typical CNN consists of multiple layers. The first layer is the input layer, which takes the raw image data as input. Then, a series of convolutional layers follow. In each convolutional layer, the model utilizes a collection of tunable filters, also referred to as kernels, to process the input image, producing feature maps that highlight different patterns or features [31]. Pooling layers are frequently interspersed between convolutional layers to perform downsampling on the feature maps, effectively reducing their spatial dimensions while preserving critical information. This downsampling process not only alleviates the computational load but also enhances the network’s resilience to input variations, making it more robust in handling diverse visual patterns [32]. The outcomes obtained from these layers are commonly flattened and then fed into one or multiple fully connected layers. These fully connected layers process the high-level features and make the final predictions, depending on the specific task.\nTo introduce non-linearity, activation functions are applied after each layer’s output. The widely adopted activation function in CNNs is the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) due to its straightforwardness and its ability to address the vanishing gradient issue effectively. By setting all negative values to zero, ReLU allows the network to efficiently learn intricate representations [33, 34].\nCNNs are typically trained using various loss functions, depending on the task. For image classification, the softmax function combined with the categorical cross-entropy loss is commonly used to measure the dissimilarity between predicted and true class probabilities.\nIn the domain of regression tasks, it is commonplace to utilize loss functions such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE) [35]. Training CNNs involves forward and backward passes through the network using an optimization algorithm like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or its variants. The goal is to minimize the chosen loss function and update the network’s parameters to improve its performance on the task.\nIn summary, CNNs are a powerful class of DL models for computer vision tasks. They consist of convolutional layers to extract relevant features, pooling layers for downsampling, fully connected layers for decision-making, and ReLU activations to introduce non-linearity. The choice of loss functions depends on the specific task, and CNNs are trained to minimize these losses through optimization algorithms. Overall, CNNs have revolutionized the field of computer vision and continue to play a vital role in various real-world applications [36]. Figure 3 illustrate the basic CNN architecture.\n2.2.2 Transfer Learning\nTransfer learning constitutes a ML approach wherein insights gained from training a model on a particular task or domain are harnessed to elevate performance on a separate yet interconnected task or domain [37]. Transfer learning offers a significant advantage by reducing the necessity for a large amount of labeled data to achieve satisfactory performance on the target task [38, 39]. Pre-training on a large and diverse dataset allows the model to learn general features that are transferable to a wide range of tasks. As a result, when the model is fine-tuned on the target task with a smaller dataset, it can adapt its learned representations to the specific nuances of the new data, leading to improved performance. Transfer learning also enables the application of DL to tasks with limited data availability. Training deep neural networks from scratch typically requires a large dataset to prevent overfitting, but in many real-world scenarios, collecting such vast amounts of data might be challenging or expensive. By utilizing pre-trained models, which have already learned useful features, transfer learning allows us to tackle tasks with limited labeled data effectively.\nAnother advantage of transfer learning is that it can help mitigate the problem of vanishing gradients. Deep neural networks often have numerous layers, and during training, gradients can become very small, making it difficult for the model to learn effectively. Pre-training on a related task helps in initializing the model’s weights in a way that provides a better starting point for the optimization process during fine-tuning, making training more stable and efficient. Furthermore, transfer learning allows the application of knowledge learned from one domain to another, leading to better generalization. For example, features learned from natural image datasets can be transferred to medical imaging tasks or satellite imagery analysis, even though the source and target domains are quite different. This transfer of knowledge helps in building more robust and versatile models that perform well in various scenarios [40, 41]. Its advantages include the reduction of data requirements, the ability to handle limited labeled data, better initialization for training, and improved generalization across different domains, making it a crucial tool for advancing artificial intelligence applications.\n2.2.3 Emerging Trends in CNNs\nPre-trained models have emerged as a game-changer in the field of AI, especially for computer vision tasks. The idea behind these models is to pre-train a neural network on a large and diverse dataset, such as ImageNet, which contains millions of images belonging to thousands of different categories. During pre-training, the model learns to extract and encode meaningful features from the data, effectively capturing a general understanding of visual patterns and structures. The advantages of pre-training are manifold. Firstly, it significantly reduces the need for massive labeled datasets when tackling new tasks. Moreover, pre-trained models act as knowledge repositories that encapsulate valuable information about the low-level and high-level features found in the training data. As a result, they offer a head start for new tasks, especially in domains where gathering labeled data can be expensive, time-consuming, or simply impractical. Additionally, pre-trained models foster better generalization. The features learned during pre-training tend to be more robust and transferable across different datasets and domains. This transfer of knowledge leads to models that exhibit improved performance, particularly when the target task’s dataset is small or dissimilar from the original training data.\nThese pre-trained architectures, such as AlexNet, VGG, InceptionV3, ResNet, DenseNet, InceptionResNetV2, Xception, and MobileNet, have become standard tools in the DL toolkit. Researchers and practitioners commonly use them as the starting point for their specific computer vision projects, saving substantial computational resources and time that would otherwise be spent on training from scratch.\n-\nAlexNet: Introduced in 2012 [38], AlexNet is one of the pioneering deep CNN. It plays a significant role in popularizing DL for computer vision tasks. AlexNet is characterized by its architecture, which comprises five convolutional layers, all using ReLU activations. This arrangement results in a deeper network compared to earlier architectures, contributing to its ability to learn more intricate features and patterns from input data.\n-\nVGG (Visual Geometry Group): VGG [42] is a deep architecture proposed by the Visual Geometry Group. It is known for its simplicity and uniformity, consisting of multiple layers with small 3 × 3 convolutional filters and max-pooling layers. VGG variants with different depths, such as VGG16 and VGG19, are widely used.\n-\nInceptionV3: Also known as GoogLeNet, InceptionV3 [43] was introduced by Google researchers. It features the Inception module, which uses multiple filter sizes within the same layer to capture different-scale features. This architecture is efficient and has excellent performance on various tasks.\n-\nResNet (Residual Network): ResNet [44] is famous for introducing residual connections, which allow the model to skip some layers during training. This innovation addresses the vanishing gradient problem and made it possible to train much deeper networks. ResNet50 and ResNet101 are common variants.\n-\nDenseNet: DenseNet [45] is designed to maximize feature reuse by connecting each layer to every subsequent layer in a feed-forward fashion. This densely connected architecture fosters better gradient flow, reduces the network complexity, and encourages feature propagation throughout the network.\n-\nInceptionResNetV2: Combining ideas from both Inception and ResNet, InceptionResNetV2 [46] achieves strong performance while being computationally efficient. It incorporates residual connections and inception modules, offering a potent combination of features.\n-\nXception (Extreme Inception): Xception represents a development of the Inception architecture and introduces depthwise separable convolutions [47]. These separable convolutions in Xception are designed to dramatically decrease the computational cost while still preserving high accuracy in the model’s predictions.\n-\nMobileNet: MobileNet is designed for mobile and embedded vision applications, emphasizing efficiency and small model size [48, 49]. It employs separable convolutions to reduce the computation complexity, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments.\nIn summary, pre-trained models have revolutionized the landscape of DL, specifically in the realm of computer vision. Their ability to transfer knowledge from extensive pre-training to new tasks with limited data has made them indispensable tools for building high-performing and resource-efficient models in various real-world applications. As DL continues to advance, pre-trained models will undoubtedly remain a crucial component in accelerating progress and making cutting-edge AI accessible to a broader audience.\n2.3 Model Evaluation Metrics\nIn this section, we explain the performance metrics of the models. Model evaluation metrics are mathematical functions used to evaluate the performance of ML models. Accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and f1 score are the most commonly used evaluation metrics. The accuracy rate is the ratio between the correctly identified samples and the total samples. Precision is defined as the ratio of true positive predictions to all positive samples. The sensitivity is used to predict the actual positive samples for each available sample. The F1 score is used to evaluate the ability of the model by combining precision and recall. FP false positives, TN true negatives, FN false negatives, and TP true positives were used to calculate the performance metrics of the model. All metrics can be calculated as follows:\n3 Bibliometric Analysis\nThe Web of science and Scopus databases were used to collect references for statistical analysis. We studied the published papers using subject area, year and journal.\n3.1 Subject Area\nWhile ML has gained significant traction in healthcare applications, there are still several areas of ML-based research that require further exploration.

[137] tried to focus on the diagnosis of diabetes using ML models. The accuracy achieved was 86% for Gradient Boosting, 79% for Logistic Regression, and 77% for Naive Bayes. The authors of the study [138] used both a multilayer network trained by the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm and a probabilistic neural network to diagnose diabetes. They compared their results to previous studies using the same dataset from the UCI repository and found that the neural network (ANN) was effective in diagnosing Pima-diabetes. In [139], the author used a logistic regression model in predicting the risk value of diabetes based on the P value and odd ratio. The algorithms were evaluated using different metrics under three data partitioning protocols (K2, K5, and K10). The author implemented four ML algorithms for the prediction of a diabetes patient. The study [140] compared five ML-based prediction models for the prediction of undiagnosed Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). The performance was measured by the prediction of fasting plasma glucose level using 100 bootstrap iterations with increasing amounts of data over 6-month intervals. The results showed that the simple regression model had the lowest average RMSE of 0.838. The authors in this study [141] have proposed an ensemble ML approach for the detection of diabetes patients. This ensemble uses three algorithms with soft voting classifier. The performance of the proposed methodology is evaluated using different metrics. The method is tested on PIMA diabetes datasets and compared to conventional ML algorithms. In this study [142], data on type 2 diabetes was gathered from a hospital in Kano, Nigeria and used to create predictive models using various ML algorithms. The random forest algorithm showed the highest accuracy with 88.76%, and the random forest and gradient boosting models were found to have the best model in terms of ROC, with 86.28% respectively. Aishwarya et al. [143] proposed a new diabetes prediction model that considers additional factors besides the typical ones like glucose levels, body mass index (BMI), age, and insulin. The model is based on a larger, more comprehensive dataset and is intended to improve the accuracy of diabetes classification compared to existing models. The study also introduces a pipeline model for diabetes prediction that aims to further enhance the accuracy of the classification. The research [144] studied the use of three supervised ML models for classifying the Pima Indians diabetes dataset. The results showed that a Naive Bayes model works well with a refined feature selection, while the Random Forest model works better with more features. Chollette et al. [145] studied the effects of a deep neural network model for accurately predicting diabetes mellitus and determining its severity during diagnosis. Using the PIMA Indian dataset, the model achieved a train and test prediction accuracy of 99.01% and 97.25%, respectively. When tested on the LMCH dataset, these figures increased to 99.57% and 97.33%. In [146], PCA was used for feature selection, and the median was used for missing value imputation. MLP classification approach was then used, resulting in an accuracy rate of 75.7%. Singh et al. [147] utilized a combination of Linear SVM, Radial Basis function SVM, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbor algorithms to classify data, resulting in an accuracy rate of 83.8%. In [148], the author presents a Source-Free TL (SFTL) model for referable diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening, addressing limited annotated data in medical image analysis. The SFTL model utilizes a generator and discriminator with adversarial and target reconstruction losses, alongside feature consistency loss, yielding competitive results on the APTOS 2019 dataset, outperforming other supervised models. In this study [149], A novel two-step framework is introduced for diabetic retinopathy (DR) diagnosis and disease stage screening, employing ML models. The first step involves identifying essential characteristics for precise diagnosis, and the second step selects a reliable ML classification method. Ensemble learning is employed to handle heterogeneous and unbalanced databases, yielding a robust ML model capable of recognizing different DR stages with high accuracy, F1-score, precision, specificity, sensitivity, and AUC. Comparisons with other ML models are also presented by the author. The study presents an automated diagnostic method [150] for early-stage Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) diagnosis using retinal fundus images. The approach utilizes the KMA-optimized ABiLSTM technique, successfully detecting and classifying DR irregularities. Comparative evaluations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method with an impressive result and reduced computation time (50 s), offering a promising solution for DR staging challenges. In this study [151], an automated DR detection and classification method is proposed, utilizing U-Net and DL techniques to overcome limitations of traditional hand-crafted feature extraction methods. The methodology follows a two-stage approach. Image processing techniques are applied to address the low percentage of positive cases in OD and BV detection, enhancing image quantity and quality. The proposed methodology efficiently detects diabetic retinopathy (DR) using retinal biomarkers (MA, HM, and EX) with high accuracies: 97.92% on EyePACS-1, 94.59% on Messidor-2, and 93.52% on DIARETDB0 datasets. In this study [152], the authors aim to address diabetic retinopathy (DR) by proposing a novel modified GC deep belief network utilizing the dwarf mongoose optimization algorithm for effective DR prediction and classification. The approach achieves an impressive 97% accuracy in classifying fundus retinal images into normal and abnormal categories, demonstrating its efficacy on the ODIR-2019 dataset. Timely DR identification is vital to prevent complete blindness caused by retinal damage. This paper introduces a novel contribution [153] to radiomics, applying computer vision techniques to (OCT, OCTA) images for DR diagnosis. ML classifiers demonstrate effective identification of patients. The addition of clinical variables enhances accuracy, showcasing radiomics-based ML techniques’ potential for diabetic retinopathy screening in type 1 DM patients. The paper conducts an extensive investigation of DR grading protocols and taxonomy [154], identifies relevant DL-related keywords, and formulates a search string with “AND” or “OR” Boolean operators. DL algorithms and methods for DR classification are analyzed and compared, considering publicly available datasets for empirical understanding. Commonly used algorithms for DR classification are identified in this study. This study [155] assesses ML prediction models’ effectiveness in detecting VTDR in type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) patients using medical data from a data warehouse. ML approaches are utilized to create VTDR prediction models achieving strong F1 scores up to 0.81, 0.70, and 0.66 on the test set, enabling accurate VTDR forecasting over ten years. The proposed models facilitate timely referral of high-risk subjects to ophthalmologists from primary care, aiding in early diagnosis and effective management of diabetic retinopathy, reducing the risk of vision loss in type 2 DM patients. In [156], the authors propose a novel approach for diabetic retinopathy classification using OCTA vascular density maps and SVM classifier optimized by a genetic evolutionary algorithm. The SVM model achieves 90% accuracy in distinguishing between PDR and NPDR based on OCTA vascular density maps of DCP, indicating the potential of this method for accurate diagnosis and classification of diabetic retinopathy patients. This study opens new avenues for future research in this field. The paper presents a novel DCNN [157] tailored for DR prediction in retinal fundus images, incorporating correlations between long-range patches (LRP) in the DL framework. This approach significantly enhances DR detection by improving local patch features, crucial for identifying DR lesions, and the residual structure allows easy integration into other networks. The suggested method outperforms existing models on the Messidor and EyePACS datasets, emphasizing the importance of considering both local and long-range global dependencies for effective DR detection in retinal fundus images.

[158] used DCNN to diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia with the goal of maximizing accuracy. The study proposed the use of the Inception V3 model with transfer learning and achieved a validation accuracy of 93%. In another study, Sohaib et al. [159] propose a DL-based system for COVID-19 detection. They evaluate the performance of several pre-trained DL models and propose a CNN architecture for the reliable classification of X-ray images. The data used in the study consists of 2,541 X-ray images from COVID-positive and healthy patients. They achieved highest accuracy rate of 99.68%. This study [160] aimed to classify lung CT images for early diagnosis of Covid-19 using DL techniques. A CNN was implemented on a dataset comprising 1,396 lung CT images, consisting of 386 instances related to Covid-19 and 1,010 instances representing non-Covid-19 cases. The attained outcomes were subsequently compared with the results produced by conventional methods. Sara et al. [161] conducted a comparative analysis of prominent DL frameworks with the aim of automating COVID-19 classification via chest X-ray and CT images. A selection of Deep CNN was made, and the derived features were supplied to diverse ML classifiers for the classification task. Notably, the most favorable performance was observed when utilizing the DenseNet121 feature extractor in conjunction with the Bagging tree classifier, yielding a remarkable accuracy of 99%. Barstugan et al. [162] proposed a ML approach for COVID-19 classification based on CT images. They used 150 CT images and extracted patches with different sizes. They used various hand-crafted features such as GLCM, LDP, GLRLM, GLSZM, and DWT, and fed the extracted features into SVM classifier. The study used different cross-validations and found that the best accuracy of 98.77% was achieved by using the GLSZM feature extractor with 10-fold cross-validation. This paper [163] presents a method for early diagnosis of COVID-19 using X-ray images with the help of DL pre-trained models. The best model was determined by considering different model hyper parameters. The evaluation of the models was conducted using publicly accessible chest X-ray images, revealing that the most favorable outcomes were achieved by the ResNet-34 model, achieving an impressive accuracy of 98.33%. Wang and Wong [164] introduced a CNN model named COVID-Net, designed for the detection of COVID-19. The achieved testing accuracy of the model was notably high at 92.6%. In this study [165], chest X-ray scans captured in the Posterior-Anterior (PA) view were subjected to analysis using DL-based models. This investigation encompassed both COVID-19 positive and healthy patients. The dataset underwent preprocessing and augmentation, followed by a comparative assessment of three distinct models in terms of accuracy. Remarkably, the Xception model demonstrated the most superior performance, achieving an impressive accuracy of 97.97% in detecting chest X-ray images. In [166], the author introduced the LW-CORONet model, meticulously engineered to extract meaningful features from chest X-ray (CXR) images. A rigorous evaluation was conducted utilizing two extensive CXR datasets, yielding classification accuracies of 98.67% and 99.00% for multi-class scenarios, and 95.67% and 96.25% for binary classification cases, respectively. Comparative analysis was undertaken against four pre-trained CNN models and state-of-the-art counterparts. Importantly, the LW-CORONet model demonstrates a pronounced advantage by demanding fewer parameters and consuming less memory space compared to alternative models. The D3SENet [167] is a novel hybrid deep feature extraction network proposed to extract the most important features from chest x-ray images. A large and balanced dataset was used to classify Covid-19 infected, viral pneumonia infected and healthy individuals. The proposed method had an impressive result, achieving an accuracy of 98.48% on a three-class classification task. Weihan et al. [168] performed experiments on a dataset of 5143 X-ray images of three different classes (Healthy, Covid-19, and Pneumonia) using both SVM and CNN. Using handcrafted features such as Texture, GLCM, GLDM, FFT, Wavelet Transform and LBP, an SVM classifier was able to achieve an accuracy of 96.3%. When using an end-to-end CNN model, an accuracy of 98.3% was reached. The paper [169] provides a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, encompassing structural features, antigen design methods, and scalability. It discusses challenges and future prospects for preventive mRNA vaccines against infectious diseases, aiming to enhance understanding and their potential in epidemic control and public health protection. In [170], emphasizes the need for long-term follow-up studies to examine respiratory symptoms and lung damage in COVID-19 survivors. It underscores the significance of post-acute COVID-19 syndrome as a potential concern for healthcare providers, necessitating comprehensive management of chronic complications in the growing population of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals globally. In [171], the investigation focuses on assessing the effectiveness of a COVID-19 booster dose vaccination in countering the Omicron variant. The study aims to clarify the ongoing debate on the importance of booster doses and their protective duration against the Omicron variant. Utilizing PubMed (Medline) for systematic search, the paper presents findings from various studies, indicating that a booster dose can increase neutralization titers against the Omicron variant and lower the risk of symptomatic breakthrough infections. In the study [172], non-invasive medical imaging is proposed to overcome RT-PCR limitations in COVID-19 diagnosis. Deep TL-based CNN approaches are evaluated to effectively analyze chest CT images, achieving improved COVID-19 screening with custom pre-trained models using batch normalization and regularization to address overfitting and enhance detection accuracy. The proposed DQ-NNPP method [173] combines two techniques with Privacy Preservation, offering improved data transmission security with reduced encryption and decryption time. By integrating cryptographic and biometric systems with DL techniques, it achieves authentication, anomaly detection, and enhanced medical system security. Comparative analysis with standard approaches, such as SAB-UAS, MSCryptoNet, and PPDP, demonstrates its effectiveness. This paper introduces a novel ensemble method [174] for the detection of COVID-19 infection from lung CT scan images. The method involves fine-tuning multiple deep neural networks. By integrating the trained models, a robust ensemble classifier is constructed, outperforming existing methods and achieving superior outcomes. In [175], the proposed method is an ensemble approach, ET-NET, for rapid COVID-19 screening using three TL models to enhance supervised image classification performance. ET-NET combines base classifiers based on confidence scores, reducing prediction errors’ variability and achieving superior results compared to the current technique on the same dataset by 1.56% through 5-fold cross-validation. The research [176] evaluates TL-based ResNet models for COVID-19 Pneumonia detection in Chest X-ray images, emphasizing the importance of CT/CXR in identifying COVID-19 infection. The study shows performance improvements in diverse target domains, attributing the success of TL. ResNet32, with a top-2 smooth loss function and cost-sensitive features, is employed as their DTL model to handle noisy and unbalanced data. Introduces [177] a novel weights-only transfer learning (TL) technique for automatic COVID-19 infection detection in CT-scan images on point-of-care devices. This approach prunes less important filters from convolutional layers, reducing pre-trained model weight parameters. Evaluation with the SARS-CoV-2 dataset confirms its effectiveness in reducing runtime resource requirements, making it suitable for point-of-care device implementation. In [178], The author suggests a transfer learning (TL) technique involving the fine-tuning of the ResNet50 model to classify COVID-19 patients. Ten pre-trained weights from diverse datasets are used, employing supervised and self-supervised learning. The COVID-19 Radiography Database is used for training and testing, with data transformation applied and the dataset split into train and test sets. The best-performing model among various fine-tuned ResNet50 TL models is identified, achieving binary classification for Covid and Normal categories.

Introduction\nBackground the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has brought revolutionary changes in major healthcare sectors, with improved tools and innovative ways for diagnosis and patient management. AI has shown a lot of promise in the field of neurology in the present day as regards both complex neurological disorder diagnosis and treatment. For instance, healthcare providers are tremendously challenged by neurological disorders due to stroke, traumatic brain injuries, epilepsy, among other acute situations, because of their complex nature and timely intervention needed in these cases. This is even more critical in emergent cases, where rapid and accurate diagnosis is needed for the right intervention on a patient. The application of AI in neurology is an extrapolation of successes made in other general areas of medicine, where large datasets have been analyzed by machine learning algorithms, neural networks, and other AI technologies to help predict outcomes and guide clinical decision-making. AI’s ability to process vast volumes of information quickly and accurately makes it a potent tool in the emerging diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders, where time plays a critical role (1).\nProblem Statement Although there have been enormous advancements in medical imaging, clinical protocols, and pharmacological treatments, timely diagnosis and effective treatment of emergent neurological conditions remains a herculean task. Also, traditional diagnostic methods are usually very time-consuming and require a lot of expertise, such as experience and, for the said reason, may not be easily accessed in case of an emergency (44). Similarly, complex neurological disorder treatments need to be customized for individual patients, making standard approaches less effective. AI has in it the potential to bridge these gaps with real-time diagnostic support and customizing treatment plans, based on huge datasets and predictive modeling. While this is its potential, AI is only at the very early stages of actual practice applications, such as emergent neurological cases. Current advancements are in need of comprehensive scrutiny due to the state of the field in the diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders with AI, which suggests specific places for further method development and research.\nWhile the advancements in AI for neurological care are promising, it is critical to acknowledge gaps in the current literature. Many existing reviews provide a broad overview of AI applications but fail to focus on emergent neurological situations where time-sensitive interventions are paramount. This article aims to fill that gap by reviewing the specific role of AI in diagnosing and managing acute neurological emergencies such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, and acute spinal cord injury. Moreover, prior reviews have not sufficiently discussed the ethical and practical challenges of integrating AI into real-world clinical settings, especially in low-resource environments. This comprehensive review will address these overlooked areas, providing a nuanced perspective on future research directions.\nAims the primary intention of the literature review is to assess the current state of AI-assisted diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders, with a particular focus on emergent cases. This review shall hence strive to:\nDiscuss recent developments in AI technologies relevant to emergent neurological disease diagnosis and treatment.\nEvaluate how well AI applications improve patient outcomes in the emergency setting.\nHighlight challenges and limitations in the implementation of AI in neurology.\nMake recommendations for future research and clinical practice.\nA well-structured review of this topic is essential to facilitate a clear understanding of AI’s transformative potential in neurology. This review will follow a systematic format to ensure coherence and clarity, covering recent technological developments, clinical applications, and the ethical implications of using AI in emergent neurological cases. By structuring the discussion around specific neurological emergencies, this review avoids the pitfalls of other articles that lack focus and cohesion. Additionally, we aim to highlight the limitations of current AI applications, thereby setting the stage for targeted research that can address these shortcomings in a meaningful way.\nPurpose and Usefulness As previously outlined, this literature review will cover studies published in the last 8 years that echo the most recent advances in AI and its applications in neurology. This review, therefore, looks at AI tools aiding in diagnoses, treatment planning, and management strategies for dealing with emergent cases of neurological disorders. Since there is an increased need for timely and accurate interventions in emergent cases, this review will focus on the role of AI on patient outcomes during such incidences (2).\n2. Methodology\nThis literature review was conducted to critically assess the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in the diagnosis and treatment of neurological emergencies, with a particular focus on emergent neurological conditions such as stroke, traumatic brain injury (TBI), and acute spinal cord injury. The review was structured to identify recent advancements, challenges, and future directions in AI applications within the neurology field.\n2.1. Literature search strategy\nThe literature search was performed using several academic databases, including PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Google Scholar, and Scopus, to identify peer-reviewed articles published between 2015 and 2023. The following key search terms were used, either individually or in combination:\n“Artificial intelligence”\n“Neurology”\n“Emergent neurological conditions”\n“Stroke diagnosis”\n“Traumatic brain injury”\n“Machine learning in healthcare”\n“Deep learning in neurology”\n“AI in medical imaging”\n“AI in EEG analysis”\n“AI in neurogenomics”\n“Cognitive disorders and AI”\nArticles that specifically addressed the use of AI for diagnosis, treatment planning, and outcome prediction in neurological conditions were included. Both retrospective and prospective studies, case studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses were considered.\n2.2. Inclusion and exclusion criteria\nThe review included studies based on the following criteria:\nInclusion Criteria:\nPublished in English.\nFocused on AI applications in neurology or healthcare.\nProvided empirical evidence of AI’s performance in diagnosing, treating, or managing neurological emergencies.\nStudies involving AI’s ethical and practical challenges in real-world clinical settings.\nExclusion Criteria:\nStudies that primarily focused on non-neurological conditions.\nArticles with limited access to full texts.\nStudies published before 2015 (except landmark studies that contributed foundational knowledge to the field).\nNon-peer-reviewed articles, abstracts, and commentaries.\n2.3. Data extraction and analysis\nRelevant data from the selected studies were extracted into a standardized table. This table included key information such as the type of AI model used (e.g., machine learning, deep learning), the neurological condition targeted, study outcomes, and the challenges or limitations identified in the study. Each article was reviewed for the AI model’s clinical utility, accuracy, speed, and the ability to integrate with traditional healthcare practices.\n2.4. Synthesis of findings\nThe findings from the reviewed studies were synthesized to identify patterns in the successful application of AI technologies in neurology. Special attention was given to AI’s role in emergent neurological conditions where timely diagnosis and intervention are critical. The review also synthesized information on the barriers to AI implementation, including ethical considerations, data privacy concerns, biases in AI models, and the integration of AI in low-resource settings. Challenges such as the “black box” nature of AI and the difficulty in clinical validation were also discussed based on the literature reviewed.\n2.5. Quality assessment\nTo ensure the robustness of the findings, each study was critically evaluated based on its methodology, sample size, and the rigor of its AI model validation. Biases and limitations of each study were documented to provide a comprehensive and balanced view of AI’s potential in neurology.\n2.6. Ethical considerations\nEthical implications were also extracted and analyzed, particularly concerning data privacy, bias in AI models, and the need for transparency and explainability in AI-driven clinical decision-making. Studies that explored the ethical dimensions of AI in healthcare were incorporated to highlight gaps and provide recommendations for future research and clinical practice.\n3. AI in healthcare: an overview\nGeneral Applications of AI in Healthcare: Artificial intelligence very much remains an integral part of the modern-day healthcare paradigm, ranging from predictive analytics to personalized medicine. Fundamentally, AI utilizes machine learning algorithms, neural networks, and natural language processing for the analysis of huge data sets to identify patterns and make predictions. AI, thus empowered, has helped improve the very core elements of healthcare: diagnosis, treatments, planning, drug discovery, and patient management.\nA good application for this is diagnostic imaging, in which AI algorithms are being trained to analyze medical images like X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans with high accuracy. The studies have shown that AI systems could be comparable or even better than human experts when finding medical image abnormalities, thus making correct and faster diagnoses (3). For instance, in oncology cases where AI was applied in the detection of cancerous lesions on radiological images, a lot of time gets saved during detection, with a result of better patient outcomes (4).\nBesides imaging, AI is also applicable in predictive analytics for the identification of patients at risk of developing some diseases. Artificial intelligence using electronic health records and other clinical data provides a predictive way of the probability of an occurrence of a disease, hence enabling intervention measures to be instituted even for preventive purposes (5). This is of great use in the prognosis of chronic illnesses such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, whereby complications and adverse effects are prevented in order to reduce healthcare expenses.\n3.1. AI in neurology\nThe field of neurology has advanced greatly through the application of AI to combat the complexities associated with neurological disorders. Symptoms of neurological conditions are generally hard to quantify and follow by traditional techniques, and this is the key argument by proponents of AI such as Rao et al. (6). With its ability to handle huge amounts of data and detect subtle patterns, AI offers a totally new approach toward these diseases.\nThe application of AI in neurology is best illustrated in diagnostic imaging. The brain images are subjected to analysis of late by use of techniques that include deep learning, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to detect and diagnose the symptoms of any upcoming potential neurological disorder. For example, AI algorithms used to find early signs of Alzheimer’s disease by studying the structure and functional MRI scans can detect those even before the clinical symptoms start to manifest in patients (7). This helps in early detection, which could play a very important role in slowing the advance of the disease and improving the quality of life for such patients.\nBesides imaging, the application of AI is seen in the analysis of EEGs for various epileptic seizure disorders and other such disorders. An analysis of an EEG by conventional procedures is both time-consuming and needs expert interpretation. AI-based systems can automate the procedure and thereby result in a quick and at-the-same-time accurate diagnosis (8). This is particularly relevant in the emergent cases of neurology, where timely diagnosis can go a long way in determining outcome post-therapy.\nEmerging Technologies in AI-Assisted Neurology: Currently, several emerging technologies are underway and will shape AI research in neurology with the potential to revolutionize diagnosis and treatment. For example, one of these technologies would be deep learning, a distinctive way of modeling complicated patterns within the data. In recent years, deep learning algorithms have been utilized to comprehend various neurological conditions’ disease mechanisms and possible therapeutic targets, which seemed to increase in relevance considerably recently (9).\nReinforcement learning, a subfield of machine learning, is another promising technology where algorithms learn through the environment they interact with to make decisions. In neurology, reinforcement learning has been applied in the development of neurorehabilitation systems during interaction with patients—a characteristic AI device that caters to changes in progression, offering personalized therapy options (10).\nIn addition, NLP is increasingly being applied in neurology for the purposes of the analysis of patient records and clinical notes. Valuable information, especially on symptoms, treatment responses, and disease progression, present in free text, can be obtained from the application of NLP algorithms in regard to a patient’s condition (11).\n3.2. AI in emergent neurological cases\nEmergent neurological cases, such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, and acute spinal cord injury, demand timely management. AI has proved its potential in such cases by giving rapid diagnostic support and aiding at critical junctures of decision-making (12). For example, AI algorithms were created in stroke cases to analyze imaging data and identify patients who would benefit from thrombolysis or thrombectomy; this vastly reduced the time required for treatment and resulted in better outcomes.\nThe use of AI systems to predict outcomes and guide decisions on treatment with data from the patient, including imaging, vital signs, and clinical history, is tremendous. Such AI-enabled insights would aid clinicians in making prioritized interventions and better allocate resources in settings with constrained resources.\n3.3. Limitations of AI in neurological emergencies\nWhile the potential for AI in neurology, particularly in emergent situations, is well-documented, the technology is not without limitations. One major challenge is the “black box” nature of many AI algorithms, especially those based on deep learning models. These models can generate accurate predictions, but their inner workings are often opaque to clinicians, leading to concerns about the interpretability of AI-assisted diagnoses and treatments (13). This lack of transparency can hinder trust and adoption in clinical settings, as healthcare providers may be hesitant to rely on systems they do not fully understand.\nMoreover, AI algorithms are only as good as the data they are trained on. Bias in AI systems is a well-recognized issue, particularly in healthcare, where training data may not adequately represent diverse patient populations. For example, AI systems trained predominantly on data from Western populations may not perform as well for patients from different ethnic backgrounds, potentially leading to misdiagnoses or suboptimal care (14). This raises ethical concerns, especially in high-stakes emergent cases where AI recommendations could significantly influence patient outcomes.\nFurthermore, the clinical validation of AI tools in real-world settings remains a significant hurdle. Many AI systems have shown promising results in controlled research environments but have yet to be thoroughly tested in everyday clinical practice, particularly in low-resource settings. The transferability of these technologies to varied healthcare environments is still questionable, as resource limitations may affect the deployment and reliability of AI systems (15). These limitations underscore the need for more comprehensive and transparent AI systems that can be trusted by clinicians and patients alike.\n4. Computer-aided diagnosis of neurological disorders\n4.1. AI in diagnostic imaging\nOne of the most important fields in which AI has contributed much to Neurology is Diagnostic Imaging. Traditional imaging techniques—beans, CT scans, and PET scans—are basically diagnostic pieces of equipment for neurological disorders. Still, their interpretation may be pretty subjective and time-consuming, needing highly specialized radiologists. AI has emerged as a power tool in the realm of imaging analysis, especially for improving accuracy and efficiency through deep learning algorithms.\nEven though the recent research evidence has been able to illustrate that AI can be applied in neurological conditions diagnosis using imaging, the history of artificial intelligence implementation dates back to over three decades ago. For instance, CNNs were designedly trained for the detecting early signs of Alzheimer’s disease by reviewing structural MRI scans. The AI systems showed an accuracy close to that of expert radiologists with faster processing times added as an advantage (4). Early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease is important for timely institution of intervention measures that might retard the process.\nAI has already been used in providing great promise to assist in a rapid diagnosis concerning emergent neurology cases, such as acute ischemic stroke. Stroke is a significant cause of worldwide disability and death with a narrow window for effective treatment. Algorithms have been developed that are AI-driven for image analysis in CT and MRI, which one can leverage quickly to capture stroke type and occluded blood vessels and assess the extent of damage in the brain. Diagnostic tools like these, powered by AI-driven innovation, would increasingly help reduce time to treatment, a critical determinant of patient outcome (16).\n4.2. AI in EEG analysis\nElectroencephalography is another vital tool in establishing the diagnosis of neurological disorders, more especially in epilepsy. Traditionally, the analysis of EEG data used to take a lot of time since it required manual interpretation by neurologists. AI has revolutionized EEG analysis with automatization of detecting abnormal brain wave activity associated with seizures and other neurological conditions.\nDeep learning models, particularly recurrent neural networks and long short-term memory networks, have been applied to EEG data in epileptic seizure prediction with a high degree of accuracy. The models are capable of going through a large data set from EEG recordings to come up with a pattern indicating seizure events that may not be observable by human eyes at any immediate instance. This is particularly useful in view of emergency situations where the time factor is pretty crucial for diagnosis and intervention.\nNevertheless, application of AI to seizure prediction has opened a window for preventive interventions. According to some studies, AI models trained with EEG data predict seizures minutes or even hours in advance, thus offering sufficiently large benefits for epilepsy management.\n4.3. AI in the diagnosis of traumatic brain injury (TBI)\nTBI is one of those critically important conditions that require immediate attention and treatment to prevent long-term neurological damage or even death. Diagnosis in cases of TBI mostly involves the use of imaging techniques, particularly CT, to determine the extent of injury to the brain. Traditional imaging techniques have usually failed in detecting subtle changes to brain structure and function following TBI due to its subtle nature of alterations.\nMore recently, AI has been, this way, applied to support the diagnosis of TBI via analysis of imaging data, with clinical variables down the line. Machine learning models have been constructed to better predict the outcomes for TBI patients from CT scan data, vital signs, and others like clinical indicators. AI-driven predictions could input into critical decisions about appropriateness related to the urgency of intervention, the need for ICU care, and potential for recovery (17).\nAI applications in neuropsychological assessments used for the diagnosis of TBI have also been applied alongside imaging. For example, the speech and language patterns of TBI patients were examined to glean insights into such cognitive impairments that lie hidden in imaging alone using NLP algorithms. It is then that this kind of multi-modal approach to diagnosis, combining imaging, clinical data, and neuropsychological assessment, held great promise in management with regard to TBI.\n4.4. Case studies and applications to real life\nSeveral case studies and real-world applications have attested to the effectiveness of AI in diagnose neurological disorders. For example, McKinney et al. (18) conducted a study that revealed the use of AI in the diagnosis of an acute stroke in a large clinical setting. It reported an AI system that could identify stroke on computed tomography scanner images virtually as well as expert radiologists do—yet significantly eased diagnosis time. This time-to-diagnosis reduction is incisive in emergent cases where every minute counts.\nAnother very good example is the application of AI in Parkinson’s disease diagnosis. AI models are trained using MRI and PET scans to detect the first manifestations of Parkinson’s, often before motor symptoms start to set in. Early diagnosis instituting treatments that slow down the progression of the disease drives better patient outcomes.\nAI has been successfully applied to epilepsy care in recent times, in relation to patient monitoring and seizure prediction. For instance, Kuhlmann et al. (19) presented an example where AI was applied in predicting seizures for patients with refractory epilepsy. The system supplied proper predictions of seizure episodes, facilitating interventions on time and thus reducing the frequency of seizures.\nCase examples in the next sections demonstrate the potential for AI to greatly affect a sea-change in neurological disorder diagnosis. As the development of AI progresses, so will the applications move into neurology, opening more opportunities in routine and emergent cases for early and accurate diagnoses.\n5. AI in treatment and management of neurological disorders\n5.1. AI-guided treatment plans\nEspecially with neurology, where patients require personalized treatment approaches because of the nature of neurological disorders—both complicated and variable—AI in treatment planning has shown remarkable promise. Recent AI-driven systems analyze big datasets, like patient history, genetic information, and clinical biomarkers, in developing personalized treatments that fit the patients’ profile. These include state-of-the-art innovations in treatment planning for patients with epilepsy. This is considered important in such conditions as epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson’s, for the treatment response of which patients sometimes show a widely differing extent.\nHowever, AI has been used to build models informed by a lot of data obtained through clinical trials and the outcomes of real-world cases related to predicting the optimal medication dosage for patients with epilepsy in a way that minimized risks yet maximized therapeutic efficacy (20). The models use machine learning algorithms to study data obtained from analyses of clinical trials and real-world patient outcomes, hence giving out better treatment options.\nIn the field of Parkinson’s disease management, AI has been utilized in the optimization of deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapy processes. DBS is a well-known and effective treatment for Parkinson’s, but its effectiveness depends on the precision of electrode placement and the setting of parameters, which are difficult to optimize by hand. Unfortunately, the management of systems with more complex representation is not that easy and could be done manually. AI-based algorithms to analyze patient-specific information reportedly lead to optimal DBS parameters, new treatment outcomes, and improvements. A good overview of the field was discussed and summarized by Kühn and Volkmann (21).\n5.2. Surgical assistance\nNeurosurgery is one of the tough-to-handle surgical specialties and needs relatively greater precision and technique. With this regard, AI has started to implement neurosurgical procedures, aiming to deliver real-time decision support and improve the surgical outcome produced in return. AI-driven surgical robotics and navigation systems have been reported in neurological surgeries with elements of complexity, such as resection of tumors and interventions to address spinal surgery (22), in line with that.\nA significant number of applications for AI implementation in neurosurgery relate to brain tumor surgical planning and execution. Conventional surgical planning depends on the surgeon’s experience and judgment, although AI systems are capable of conducting preoperative imaging data analysis for creating 3D models, hence the neuronavigation tackle relevant to information on these models. Such showcases work to let surgeons know exactly where to make the incision so that they cause as little damage as possible to the healthy tissue around a tumor (23).\nIn this sense, an AI-powered robotic system can take part in helping the instruments get feedback during a surgery, maintaining its steadiness and offering real-time feedback to the surgeon. With this approach, it will be more accurate, will reduce the effect of human fallibility, and will allow undertakings that are less aggressive. For example, AI-supported robotic systems, such as ROSA and Mazor X, have led to increased surgical accuracy and decreased recovery times in spinal surgeries and deep brain stimulation procedures, respectively. AiBootApplication.\n5.3. Rehabilitation and long-term management\nNotably, the role of AI applies beyond acute treatment to rehabilitation and long-term management in neurological disorders. Motor and cognitive recovery in patients suffering from rehabilitation period.\nTrueAIhas helped develop the leading personal rehabilitation programs, which are based on patients’ progress. Machine learning algorithms analyze rehabilitation session data to read patterns of movement and recovery metrics, in order to make real-time adjustments to therapy protocols. For example, AI-enabled exoskeletons and robotic devices provide assistance to patients in carrying out repetitive movements involved in physical therapy, with features like real-time feedback and setting resistance according to the ability of the patient. For interventions on a more precise level, robotic devices may sometimes be incorporated into traditional physical therapy. For instance, robotic gait trainers can enable walking movements for (39).\nApart from physical rehabilitation, AI has also been incorporated into cognitive rehabilitation for patients with brain injuries and neurodegenerative diseases. Artificial intelligence-powered platforms can deliver personalized cognitive exercises for the irregularities of a specific patient, can systematically track the progress of the activities, and even modulate the difficulties during the course of the improvement tempo (24). These types of systems can find effective use in further elicitation of cognitive recovery in stroke patients and those suffering from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (25, 40).\nMore importantly, AI applications will be important in the long-term monitoring of a patient and management. For instance, wearable devices and mobile health apps with AI abilities will be useful in monitoring vital signs and patterns of movement and symptoms delivery in real time to healthcare providers (26). For instance, AI-driven apps have been useful to monitor the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease like tremors and abnormalities in the gait, allowing the remote adjustment in clinical management for patients with the disease carved out herein (27). Continuous monitoring comes very handy in chronic neurological conditions because it can help reveal the course of chronologically developing symptoms that might prevent later complications and hospitalizations (42).\n5.4. Case-based studies and real-life applications\nSeveral real-world applications highlight the transformation that the AI field is having in the treatment and management of neurological disorders. A good example is the optimization of the treatment plan for conditions such as strokes. A study by McKinney et al. (18) has also proven that the AI system can review patient information, imaging, and clinical history to give a recommendation for the best thrombolytic therapy or the best surgical operation. This AI-driven approach reduced time to treatment and improved patient outcomes in acute cases of stroke.\nRobotic systems incorporated with the help of AI in neurosurgery have shown that successfully conducted complex resections. A case report documented by Shen et al. (22) was performed on the use of an AI-driven robotic system during a resection of glioblastoma, one of the most aggressive forms of brain cancer. The robotic system is capable of providing real-time feedback before and during surgery to allow the surgeon to conduct better resection with minimed damage to neighborhood tissues for good patient outcomes.\nAI-exoskeletons have also been used for stroke patients. A study by Mehrholz et al. (28) has shown that stroke patients using AI exoskeletons for their rehabilitation had significantly better mobility and functional independence as compared to those treated with conventional therapy.\nThese are illustrative of the potential of AI in changing the very landscape of treatment and management in neurological disorders and thus give fresh hope both to the patient and the clinician.\n6. Ethical and practical concerns\n6.1. Ethical implications\nThe excessively rapid uptake of AI in neurological diagnosis and treatment raises numerous very serious ethical issues and, if not handled properly, it could tilt the scales toward responsible and fair use. One major issue of AI that comes to the focus with such a rapid uptake is bias within the algorithms. AI systems in nature are based on gigantic datasets, and lack of representation of diversified population in these datasets may be a significant problem where the developed algorithms continue their existence discretely. For example, research indicates that models of AI that are largely trained on data from certain ethnic groups are less accurate for patients from other backgrounds, with possible outcomes of misdiagnosis—and underdiagnosis—and less than optimal care (14).\nSelection of such datasets must be diverse and represent the population to avoid this issue. This also requires that there be transparency in both the development and the deployment stages of the AIs; both the clinicians and patients need to know how the decisions are being made by an AI algorithm and therefore know what limitations or bias are possible (29). Maintaining ethical AI practice also needs ongoing monitoring and validation of the AI systems to prove that they will perform equally well with all patients (41).\nAnother important ethical issue surrounding AI in healthcare is privacy and data security. The accuracies of AI systems for treating patients come from its training with very large pools of patient data that are essentially medical records, imaging data, and genetic information. Such a sensitive use of data raises concerns about its misuse and unauthorized access or potential breach with such large pools of sensitive personal health information. Privacy and security of patient data are very critical; the data should, therefore, be well protected with strong protection mechanisms to ensure that the data is secure.\nAnother critical ethical consideration is that of informed consent in using AI in healthcare. It is important that patients are properly informed on how AI systems would be used and the basis of the data to be collected and the use to which such data will be put. Correctly, patients should be given the chance not to receive AI-driven interventions if they would prefer the traditional method of care. Ensuring that patients are aware of their rights and that they have autonomy in their healthcare decisions is essential in maintaining trust in AI technologies.\nThere comes the issue of accountability and responsibility whenever AI is utilized toward care. Sure, AI systems generate enormous insights and in many instances give recommendations, but in the end, the liability associated with clinical decisions lies with human providers. Of the greatest significance is the guidance on how the recommendations made by AI should be integrated into clinical practice: the final decision regarding the treatment has to rely on the judgment of professionals and patient preferences (30).\nEthical considerations are crucial when discussing the deployment of AI in neurological emergencies. A significant concern is the transparency of AI decision-making processes, often referred to as the “black box” problem. Clinicians and patients alike may struggle to trust AI-driven recommendations without a clear understanding of how the system arrives at these conclusions. Furthermore, regulatory frameworks for AI in healthcare remain underdeveloped, making it challenging to ensure that AI systems meet the required standards of safety and efficacy. Comprehensive guidelines and strict regulatory oversight are needed to prevent misuse and ensure that AI technologies are deployed responsibly.\n6.2. Practical challenges\nLaying aside ethical concerns, some practical ones in respect to how AI can really be transformed and integrated with usable healthcare clinical practices points to problems in regard to interoperability: In this line, most of the hospitals and clinics currently in play lack proper interoperation of sophisticated AI systems and legacy systems of healthcare infrastructure. Serious efforts should be applied to establish appropriate compatibility of the advanced modern AI technologies with the popular legacy systems prevalent in most of the hospitals and clinics. Upgrading these systems to AI tool accommodation would be time and resource-consuming, which will thus represent a critical challenge in making the technologies widely accepted.\nIn addition, clinical applications will call for significant training of the healthcare workforce. Ideally, the medical workforce should be trained in the utilization of such AI tools, interpret results and integrate them for better understanding of patient care (31). That is bound to call for realignment in the medical-education framework and shift in training programs to allow for the next generation of healthcare associates to be conversant with these AI technologies.\nYet another practical challenge lies in health care AI regulation. The regulatory entities have yet established frameworks for the specific evaluation of safety and efficacy for medical devices and software driven by AI, according to Bakker et al. (32). Assurance that AI systems meet requirements can be a long and painstaking procedure; thus, critical technologies are likely to remain partners in some cases without deployment in clinical settings.\nBesides that, the implementation of AI may be very costly, enough for most healthcare institutions, especially the low-resource ones, to not afford. While AI has the potential to cut health service costs in the long term, since it is efficient and enhances health outcomes, the high magnitude of the required investment in infrastructure, training, and integration of AI services could be substantial. Rising to all the financial challenges will be crucial to realize the benefits of AI for all patients regardless of geography or economic status.\nFinally, there is the issue of acceptance. Apart from the anticipated improvement that may come from AI, any form of impact or changes in the tasks from work might be among those reasons that the healthcare professional is apprehensive of using the technology because it means dispossession of work, loss of control, and others (15). Embracing AI in neurology as a valuable tool throughout the field, and even beyond it, will be of paramount importance in building trust for these systems and showcasing their clinical validation and value throughout real-world success stories.\n6.3. Balancing innovation with responsibility\nThe practical and ethical challenges associated with AI in neurology underline the need for a balanced approach that holds concerns of innovation and responsibility with equal respect. While AI offers the potential to completely revolutionize the process of diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders, it is, at the same time, very important that development and deployment of such technologies be carried out in a fair manner that is transparent and according to the highest standards of patient care.\nThis will likely emanate from collaborative working of AI developers, healthcare providers, patients, and regulatory bodies, who might work together in order to ensure AI technologies work in a manner that supports all patients, addresses all ethical concerns, and overcomes all practical challenges. In this way, all potential ways of AI application in neurology would be fully realized, thereby offering new hope for patients with neurological disorders but at the same time maintaining the trust and confidence of the healthcare community.\n7. Broader applications of AI in neurology\nTo provide a comprehensive review of AI’s role in neurology, it is crucial to broaden the scope beyond its well-established applications, such as in stroke, Alzheimer’s disease, and epilepsy. AI technologies hold vast potential for addressing a wider range of neurological conditions, particularly those that have historically been underrepresented in the literature. Expanding research in this area would allow AI to demonstrate its versatility and impact across various complex and rare neurological disorders.\nOne of the emerging areas where AI can play a transformative role is in neurogenomics. AI has the ability to analyze large volumes of genetic data to identify patterns and genetic mutations associated with neurological conditions. For example, AI-driven tools are increasingly being used to predict disease onset and progression in disorders like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Huntington’s disease (9). By integrating neuroimaging, genetic data, and clinical biomarkers, AI can help clinicians develop personalized treatment strategies tailored to a patient’s unique genetic profile, which is particularly relevant in managing these neurodegenerative diseases where early detection is critical (7).\nIn addition, AI has shown promise in the management of movement disorders such as Parkinson’s disease. Beyond diagnostic imaging and predictive analytics, AI can be used to optimize treatment plans for patients receiving deep brain stimulation (DBS). By analyzing patient data in real time, AI systems can adjust stimulation parameters to provide more precise therapeutic outcomes (21). This capability allows for continuous, personalized care, reducing the need for frequent hospital visits and improving the quality of life for patients with chronic movement disorders.\nAnother area where AI could expand its application is in mental health and cognitive disorders. AI-driven models have been developed to assist in the diagnosis of psychiatric and cognitive disorders like depression, schizophrenia, and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (7). AI can analyze speech patterns, facial expressions, and behavioral data to detect early signs of cognitive decline, offering potential for early interventions in conditions like dementia. This approach provides clinicians with real-time insights that go beyond traditional cognitive assessments, allowing for a more dynamic and individualized understanding of patient progress.\nFurthermore, AI can be instrumental in identifying biomarkers and developing predictive models for rarer conditions, such as multiple system atrophy (MSA) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). These diseases often have overlapping symptoms with more common conditions, making early and accurate diagnosis challenging. AI algorithms trained on multimodal data—encompassing neuroimaging, clinical records, and genetic information—can help differentiate between these disorders, providing more timely and accurate diagnoses (33).\nDespite these promising developments, there is still limited research on AI’s application to these broader neurological conditions. Future research must focus on expanding AI models to cover a wider array of neurological diseases, ensuring that these technologies benefit all patients, not just those with more commonly studied disorders. Collaborative efforts between neurologists, AI researchers, and healthcare providers will be essential in developing AI systems that can be generalized across diverse neurological conditions, leading to more inclusive and equitable healthcare solutions.\n8. Comparative analysis: AI vs. traditional methods in neurological emergencies\nFor AI to truly transform the field of neurology, its applications must be critically compared to traditional diagnostic and treatment methods. While AI offers significant advantages in speed, precision, and the ability to process vast datasets, traditional methods still hold value in various clinical contexts, especially when considering the expertise of seasoned clinicians and the established reliability of manual diagnostic techniques.\nOne of the most well-recognized benefits of AI is its ability to analyze complex imaging data far more rapidly than human clinicians. For example, AI algorithms applied to CT and MRI scans in stroke cases can reduce diagnosis time from hours to minutes, a critical factor in improving patient outcomes (18). These algorithms can also detect subtle abnormalities that might be missed by human eyes, particularly in time-sensitive conditions like ischemic stroke, where quick identification of occlusions can determine whether a patient is a candidate for thrombolytic therapy (12).\nHowever, traditional methods, particularly manual interpretation of imaging data, still play an essential role, especially in cases where clinical judgment and experience are needed to contextualize findings. For instance, while AI can flag potential abnormalities, it may struggle with atypical presentations that experienced radiologists or neurologists could interpret within the broader clinical picture (3). The complexity of neurological emergencies often requires the integration of multiple diagnostic inputs, including clinical history, laboratory results, and imaging studies—areas where human clinicians excel in synthesizing information for comprehensive decision-making.\nMoreover, the robustness of AI in real-world clinical settings, particularly in low-resource environments, remains a significant concern. Traditional methods, though time-consuming, do not rely on advanced infrastructure, making them more accessible in healthcare settings with limited resources. This is a critical advantage when deploying diagnostic tools in rural or underserved areas, where AI-driven systems requiring high computational power and sophisticated hardware may not be feasible (34). In such settings, traditional methods remain the gold standard for ensuring patients receive adequate care.\nAnother area of comparison is in treatment personalization. AI-driven treatment plans, particularly for conditions like epilepsy and Parkinson’s disease, leverage vast amounts of patient data to recommend highly personalized therapies (9). However, traditional clinical decision-making, informed by years of medical experience, offers a level of intuition that AI systems currently lack. For example, while AI might suggest optimal DBS (Deep Brain Stimulation) settings for a Parkinson’s patient based on data, a neurologist’s familiarity with the patient’s nuanced responses to treatment can guide adjustments that enhance the patient’s quality of life (21).\nFinally, AI and traditional methods differ in how they handle the element of uncertainty in neurological care. AI systems rely on probabilistic models that calculate the likelihood of outcomes based on available data. While this approach offers a level of precision and objectivity, it may fall short in cases where the data is incomplete or ambiguous. On the other hand, experienced clinicians are often adept at navigating uncertainty, making judgment calls based on intuition and years of practice—an area where AI has yet to match human capability (35).\nIn conclusion, AI offers clear advantages in terms of speed and data processing but still requires integration with traditional clinical methods, particularly in complex or resource-limited settings. Future research should focus on developing hybrid models that combine AI’s computational power with the clinical expertise of human neurologists, ensuring that both tools are used in complementary ways to improve patient outcomes in neurological emergencies.\n9. Future directions and recommendations\n9.1. Emerging trends in AI-assisted neurology\nAI in neurology heralds a bright future with the lightning advances made in machine learning, data analytics, and computational power. Many emerging trends are set to shape the future of AI-assisted diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders.\nOne of these trends is in multimodal approaches from AI frameworks, which combine different realms of data—imaging, genetic information, and clinical biomarkers—toward characterizing a condition for more complete and accurate diagnoses. Such systems combined from various sources can therefore help to realize much better diagnosis accuracy and avert several misdiagnoses that might be averted in hard neurological conditions. For example, genomics data can be combined with imaging results in diseases like brain tumors and neurodegenerative diseases to give valuable evidence for precision treatment strategies (24).\nNeurogenomics represents a second most impactful emerging area that is being exposed by AI. Recent advances in the field of genomics and increasing volumes of available genetic data open up opportunities for AI discovery and corresponding targeted neurogenomic therapeutic interventions. Analysis driven by AI of these genetic data may well lead to more targeted therapy in general with respect to more accurate diagnoses of treatment—especially for serious genetically based conditions like Huntington’s disease and ALS (9).\nIn the case of another line, AI is growingly used to develop predictive models for the neurological disorder of interest. Such high-risk groups can lead, for example, to conditions such as Alzheimer’s or stroke, and early intervention and preventive therapy can be taken. Predictive analytics, with the help of AI, changes the field of neurology by switching it from a reactive to a proactive regime. It can avert the onset and reduce the progression of disease.\nAnother ray of hope is the integration of AI along with wearable devices and telemedicine platforms. Wearable devices with built-in AI models may offer continuous neuro health monitoring of patients, with the detection of initial manifestations of decline and real-time alerting to a healthcare provider. The importance of continuous monitoring cannot be overemphasized, since timely changes in treatment planning may prevent complications for such patients with chronic disorders as Parkinson’s disease or epilepsy.\n9.2. Recommendations for clinical practice\nSeveral catalyzers realize the full potential that AI can make in neurology for successful integration into clinical practice. Therefore, the following recommendations are proposed for healthcare providers along with policymakers and researchers to facilitate the adoption of AI technologies in neurology:\nInfrastructure Investment in AI: Investment in the infrastructure needed, within healthcare institutions, to support AI technologies, such as advanced computing systems, data storage solutions, and secure networks. Such an investment is important in embedding AI systems into the existing workflow in the clinics in such a manner that it is best used.\nIMPROVE QUALITY OF DATA AND DIVERSITY: AI models ought to be trained on diverse good quality data so that it can reduce bias and improve generalizability. Potential ways to ensure data are drawn from diverse patient populations, possibly including underrepresented groups, to ensure that AI systems are continuously oriented to operate equally across different subgroups, should an effort become prevalent toward these ends.\nPromoting a Collaborative Interdisciplinary Field the Development of: Developing and applying AI in neurology requires a coordinated effort of AI development professionals, neurologists, and radiologists. It needs the cooperation of geneticists and other professionals working in healthcare. Systems developed by interdisciplinary teams will link the differences between technology and clinical practice into systems that are developed holistically to account for differences in the needs and priorities of patients and clinicians (30).\nEthical and Regulatory Compliance: AI developers should, therefore, put serious first consideration on ethics and observe regulatory standards. This pits several aspects that touch on privacy and data protection, informed consent issues, and general issues of accountability when AI systems are deployed into clinical settings, as has been postulated by numerous authors (29).\nInvestment in Clinician Education and Training: Both medical education curricula and training programs should include AI-augmented activities and protocols, preparing healthcare providers in this environment. Equally essential is having the knowledge clinicians must possess for better interpretation and integration of AI-sourced insights while providing care and recognizing AI’s capabilities and limitations in the process (36).\nSupport Ongoing Research and Development: Research in the development of AI applications for neurology needs continued support in order to either optimize existing solutions or keep pace with the development of new solutions. Specifically, funding agencies and academic institutions should ensure continuous support for research work that focuses on developing new AI solutions promising to support improvements in the diagnosis, management, and treatment of neurological disorders.\n9.3. Research gaps and future studies\nDespite its tremendous potential in the field of neurology, there are still certain important research gaps that need to be addressed in future studies. Among the most crucial, though, is another call for studies to be longitudinal investigations that assess the effects of AI-driven interventions over a long period of patient outcomes. Although most of the studies indicate the short-term benefits that AI brings, knowledge about its effects for a long term is of importance in knowing the worth or value conferred in clinical practice.\nAnother research gap is the development of explainable models of AI. Whereas AI systems could provide, with a good degree of accuracy, predictions and recommendations, they often acted like “black boxes” that are hard to understand at a deep level by clinicians. Development of transparent and explainable AI models will go a long way in engendering trust among healthcare providers in AI-driven decisions and ensuring that they are well understood and actionable (13).\nIn addition, ethical implications around issues of bias, fairness, and accountability necessitate more research on applied AI to neurology. It is a necessity to find ways in which biases in the AI systems are reduced to assure the developed technologies will be used equitably across all patient populations (37).\nFuture research in AI for neurological emergencies must focus on creating more interpretable and transparent AI systems. While deep learning models have shown great promise, their complexity often makes it difficult for clinicians to understand the rationale behind their recommendations. Developing explainable AI models will not only foster greater trust in these systems but also improve clinical adoption. Additionally, there is a need for longitudinal studies that assess the long-term outcomes of AI-driven interventions. Most current studies focus on immediate improvements, but the sustainability of these benefits over time remains unclear. Addressing these gaps is critical to ensuring the widespread and equitable application of AI in neurology.\nDespite the promising strides made in AI applications for neurological emergencies, significant gaps remain in the current body of research. One key area that has been underexplored is the deployment of AI in low-resource settings. Most AI technologies in neurology are developed and tested in high-resource environments equipped with state-of-the-art imaging devices and computational infrastructure (34). However, in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where healthcare resources are scarce, the implementation of these AI systems faces considerable challenges. Research is urgently needed to modify AI systems for use in such settings, focusing on technologies that require less computational power, can work with limited or lower-quality data, and are cost-effective (38). The lack of studies in this area exacerbates the global inequality in healthcare access, and addressing this gap is crucial for ensuring that AI can benefit patients worldwide, regardless of geographic or economic barriers (43).\nAnother gap in the literature pertains to the long-term efficacy of AI-driven interventions. While there is substantial evidence showing the short-term benefits of AI in acute neurological conditions, such as rapid diagnosis and treatment of stroke (12), the impact of these interventions over extended periods remains unclear. For example, the use of AI in predicting stroke outcomes has demonstrated immediate improvements in treatment speed, but studies rarely follow patients long enough to evaluate the sustainability of these outcomes (18). Longitudinal studies are necessary to assess whether AI-driven improvements in the acute phase translate into long-term health benefits, particularly in managing chronic conditions like epilepsy and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Furthermore, these studies should investigate how AI-driven diagnostics and treatments affect patients’ quality of life, rehabilitation outcomes, and overall healthcare costs in the long term (35).\nAdditionally, the literature is disproportionately focused on a handful of well-known neurological conditions, such as stroke, Alzheimer’s disease, and epilepsy, while rare and complex conditions remain largely unexplored (9). For instance, there is a scarcity of studies examining AI’s potential in diagnosing and managing conditions like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Huntington’s disease, despite the fact that these diseases could greatly benefit from the pattern recognition and predictive capabilities of AI systems (7). Expanding research to include these less common but equally devastating neurological disorders is essential for creating a comprehensive understanding of AI’s role in neurology.\nLastly, researchers need to develop knowledge of how the technology might be scaled up and made more accessible in the future, in the understudied conditions of low-resource use. Although developed, AI had captured significant goodwill where high-resource conditions prevail, several issues underscore the need for technologists and developers to develop insights about how these technologies will be transported for use in low-resource-exploiting conditions, where advanced medical care afforded by high-resource usage is too expensive. This is important for developing AI solutions that are affordable and scalable and therefore would ensure benefits in neurology are made available to all patients, regardless of their origin or economic status.\nFunding Statement\nThe author(s) declare that no financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nAuthor contributions\nMA: Writing – review & editing, Writing – original draft, Visualization, Resources, Formal analysis, Conceptualization.

Accurately predicting cardiovascular disease poses a significant challenge within clinical data analysis. The present study introduces a prediction model that utilizes various combinations of information and employs multiple established classification approaches. The proposed technique combines the genetic algorithm (GA) and the recursive feature elimination method (RFEM) to select relevant features, thus enhancing the model’s robustness. Techniques like the under sampling clustering oversampling method (USCOM) address the issue of data imbalance, thereby improving the model’s predictive capabilities. The classification challenge employs a multilayer deep convolutional neural network (MLDCNN), trained using the adaptive elephant herd optimization method (AEHOM). The proposed machine learning-based heart disease prediction method (ML-HDPM) demonstrates outstanding performance across various crucial evaluation parameters, as indicated by its comprehensive assessment. During the training process, the ML-HDPM model exhibits a high level of performance, achieving an accuracy rate of 95.5% and a precision rate of 94.8%. The system’s sensitivity (recall) performs with a high accuracy rate of 96.2%, while the F-score highlights its well-balanced performance, measuring 91.5%. It is worth noting that the specificity of ML-HDPM is recorded at a remarkable 89.7%. The findings underscore the potential of ML-HDPM to transform the prediction of heart disease and aid healthcare practitioners in providing precise diagnoses, exerting a substantial influence on patient care outcomes.\nSimilar content being viewed by others\nIntroduction\nHealthcare encompasses a range of disciplines. It focuses on preventing, diagnosing, treating, and caring for illnesses and ailments that impact people’s and communities’ overall health and welfare1. The scope of services is extensive, including diverse offerings such as medical exams, interventions, psychological assistance, and public health activities. Healthcare professionals, encompassing a diverse range of individuals such as physicians, nurses, therapists, and researchers, engage in collaborative efforts to safeguard the whole well-being of patients, surrounding their physical, mental, and emotional health. Alongside clinical treatment, healthcare contains health information, illness prevention, and health advancement, all of which improve the overall quality of life2.\nHeart disease, an often-seen and frequently consequential medical ailment, has a profound interdependence with the broader healthcare domain3. Heart disease is a significant contributor to illness and death worldwide, underscoring the crucial role of healthcare systems in tackling pressing health concerns. Heart disease comprises a range of conditions that impact the heart and blood arteries, including heart failure, coronary artery disease, arrhythmias, and valve abnormalities. Healthcare professionals are crucial in diagnosing heart disease by using medical evaluations, employing modern imaging methods, and conducting diagnostic procedures4. The management of the condition involves a comprehensive approach encompassing lifestyle adjustments, pharmaceutical therapies, and surgical procedures, highlighting the need for interdisciplinary cooperation among healthcare professionals. Healthcare efforts that prioritize the promotion of heart-healthy habits, the enhancement of perception, and the advocacy for early detection play a crucial role in mitigating the prevalence of heart disease and enhancing cardiovascular well-being on a broader scope. Examining and controlling cardiovascular disease exemplify the complex interaction between healthcare and the welfare of people and society5.\nCardiovascular disorders rank first among the most lethal illnesses. They are well recognized as a significant contributor to mortality on a worldwide scale6. Based on statistical data from the World Health Organization, it was reported that cardiac disorders were responsible for about 18 million fatalities in 2016. In the United States, cardiovascular illnesses, including heart disease, hypertension, and stroke, are the leading causes of mortality. Cardiovascular heart disease (CHD) is responsible for about one-seventh of all fatalities in the United States, resulting in an estimated yearly death toll of 3 million individuals7. The prevalence of myocardial infarctions in the United States is roughly 7.9 million, accounting for approximately 3% of heart attack incidents among American adults. In the year 2015, a total of 1 million individuals inside a single nation succumbed to fatalities resulting from heart attacks8. Based on the findings of a study, the symptoms associated with heart disease include a range of manifestations such as chest tightness, discomfort, pressure, breath shortness, leg shivers, neck pain, abdomen pain, tachycardia, dizziness, bradycardia, fainting, syncope, which skin color modifications, leg swelling, weight loss, and weariness9. The symptoms of heart illness, including arrhythmia, myocardia, heart failure, congenital heart disease, mitral regurgitation, and dilated cardiomyopathy, exhibit variation based on their specific nature.\nThe risk factors associated with heart disease include several aspects such as advanced age, genetic predisposition, tobacco use, physical behaviors, substance misuse, elevated cholesterol levels, hypertension, sedentary lifestyle, obesity, diabetes, psychological stress, and inadequate hygiene practices10. The gravity of cardiovascular disease mandates the implementation of a screening protocol for its diagnosis. In the screening procedure, medical professionals provide many diagnostic tests, including blood glucose level testing, cholesterol testing, blood pressure measurement, electrocardiography (ECG), ultrasound imaging, cardiac computer tomography (CT), calcium scoring, and stress testing. The screening procedure requires significant time-consuming manual tasks and human involvement.\nThe primary contributions of the research are listed below:\n-\nUsing the GA and RFEM in advanced feature selection guarantees identifying the most relevant features, reducing interference and augmenting the model’s predictive capability.\n-\nUsing feature extraction methodologies extends beyond merely selecting raw attributes, converting the data into a more comprehensive and informative representation. This process enhances the input for later analysis.\n-\nUSCOM techniques tackle the prevalent issue of uneven data distribution, enhancing the model’s capacity to generalize well across different classes.\n-\nUsing a MLDCNN in classification exploits the ability of deep learning to capture detailed patterns present in complicated databases effectively, improving the model’s prediction performance.\n-\nThe AEHOM facilitates the refinement of the model’s parameters, enhancing its performance and promoting effective convergence during training.\nThe following sections are arranged in the given manner: “Background and literature survey”aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the backdrop around heart disease prediction and thoroughly examine pertinent previous research conducted in this field. “Proposed heart disease prediction system” describes the unique machine learning-based heart disease prediction method (ML-HDPM) approach, which integrates feature selection, feature extraction, UAO, MLDCNN, and AEHOM techniques to achieve precise prediction. “Simulation analysis and findings” presents and analyzes the numerical results, emphasizing the better effectiveness of the ML-HDPM model in predicting heart disease. “Conclusions” provides a concise overview of the obtained results, examines their ramifications, and delineates potential directions for future investigations and improvements within the domain.\nBackground and literature survey\nCardiovascular disorders have been widely acknowledged as one of the primary contributors to mortality. Several research investigations have been conducted to examine the use of predictive models in forecasting indicators associated with the likelihood of developing cardiac disorders based on health data found in the existing literature. The latest advancements in machine learning tools and algorithms have stimulated research efforts in creating methodologies and techniques for detecting cardiac disease. Numerous methods have been explored to address this issue, including classification, clustering, etc.\nThe work conducted by Abdullatif et al. introduces a novel approach that combines supervised infinite feature selection with an enhanced weighted random forest algorithm to detect heart disease11. The process is selected to improve the significance of features and the model’s accuracy. The simulation results show significant improvement, achieving an accuracy rate of 92.14%, a sensitivity rate of 92.50%, and a specificity rate of 91.78%. This methodology presents an enhanced approach for detecting cardiac illness, potentially increasing patients’ survival rates.\nMuhammad et al. propose a sophisticated computer model to identify cardiac illness precisely12. The solution being presented utilizes machine learning methods to get accurate diagnoses. The model demonstrates favorable results, achieving an accuracy rate of 92.42%, a sensitivity rate of 92.40%, and a specificity rate of 92.44%. This work showcases the capacity of intelligent computational models to diagnose cardiac disease with precision and efficiency.\nArnaout et al. provide a novel approach, including using an ensemble of neural networks for the accurate prenatal detection of complicated congenital heart disease13. The use of neural networks in this approach enables precise diagnostic outcomes. The ensemble exhibits exceptional performance, attaining an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve value of 0.98. The research emphasizes the possibility of using neural network ensembles to identify fetal cardiac disease.\nThe study conducted by Alkhodari et al. centers on diagnosing valvular heart disease using convolutional and recurrent neural networks (CNNs and RNNs) applied to phonocardiogram recordings14. The selection of CNNs and RNNs is appropriate for data organized in sequences. The findings exhibit a noteworthy outcome, showcasing an overarching precision rate of 95.86%. This underscores the effectiveness of using deep learning techniques in the realm of diagnosing valvular heart disease.\nThe heart disease diagnosis approach using machine learning classification in the field of e-healthcare is proposed by Li et al.15. The research utilizes a range of classification techniques to enhance the precision of identification. The Random Forest classifier has notable performance, with an accuracy rate of 90.47%, a precision value of 0.909, and a recall value of 0.912. This method places significant emphasis on using machine learning techniques within the field of e-healthcare, specifically to accurately identify cases of heart disease.\nDixit et al. demonstrated the use of a cost-effective and portable ECG sensor for the early identification of cardiovascular disease16. Their suggested solution utilizes machine learning algorithms to process ECG data. The system encompasses several characteristics, such as capturing, preprocessing, and categorizing ECG signals. The simulation findings demonstrate a high level of accuracy, namely 95.2%, in diagnosing cardiac illnesses. This highlights the potential for using a low-cost ECG sensor as an effective means of early detection.\nAlsafi et al. introduced a sophisticated machine-learning system to diagnose coronary heart disease17. The presented approach utilizes machine learning methodologies to examine patient data, effectively using their characteristics for precise diagnoses. The simulation results demonstrate a notable level of precision, with an accuracy rate of 97.4%. This highlights their methodology’s potential to improve coronary heart disease diagnosis.\nAli et al. provided a novel healthcare monitoring system to anticipate cardiac disease18. The proposed method employs ensemble deep learning and feature fusion techniques to analyze patient data. The technique’s effectiveness is shown by its ability to achieve a prediction accuracy of 92.34% in the context of heart disease, highlighting the promise of ensemble deep learning as a reliable approach for monitoring healthcare.\nGárate-Escamila et al. focused on predicting heart disease using classification models, feature selection techniques, and principal component analysis (PCA)19. The suggested methodology emphasizes the importance of feature selection and dimensionality reduction. The simulation findings demonstrate a competitive level of performance, as shown by an accuracy rate of 87.5% obtained via the use of PCA. This outcome highlights the promising capabilities of these approaches in the realm of heart disease prediction.\nSonawane et al. proposed a heart disease prediction model that integrates data and ECG signals using a hybrid clustering approach20. The proposed method combines clustering methodologies with machine learning algorithms to achieve precise prediction. The suggested method achieves a classification accuracy of 92.6%, offering the possibility of using hybrid clustering techniques to enhance the prediction of cardiac illness by integrating both traditional data and ECG signals.\nThe literature review elucidates many methodologies for diagnosing and predicting heart illness, including advanced machine learning, deep learning, and sensor-based data-collecting strategies. Although these methodologies provide encouraging outcomes, several limitations arise, such as inconsistent diagnostic precision and possible issues related to overfitting. The suggested methods effectively tackle these issues by incorporating cutting-edge technology and feature selection procedures, augmenting the accuracy and dependability of heart disease diagnosis and prognosis.\nProposed heart disease prediction system\nThe research endeavors to establish a comprehensive framework for achieving precise heart disease prediction, employing a multifaceted approach that integrates advanced machine learning methodologies, feature selection, and dimensionality reduction techniques. By harnessing sophisticated machine learning algorithms, the model adeptly discerns intricate patterns embedded within patient data, utilizing ensemble deep learning and innovative feature fusion strategies. This holistic strategy ensures the accurate and timely prognosis of cardiac disease, furnishing healthcare practitioners with a valuable tool to enhance patient treatment outcomes.\nMoreover, the hybrid system encompasses three pivotal stages: data gathering, pre-processing, and classification, each playing pivotal roles in refining the predictive model. During the meticulous pre-processing phase, a series of tasks are meticulously executed to uphold data integrity and model efficacy. These tasks encompass the meticulous imputation of missing data, wherein the ML-HDPM method is proficiently utilized to accurately estimate absent values within the database. Furthermore, exhaustive feature selection endeavors are undertaken to pinpoint the most pertinent attributes for predictive modeling. This process is facilitated by a hybrid technique that synergistically amalgamates the capabilities of genetic algorithm (GA) and recursive feature elimination method (RFEM), facilitating the identification of informative features crucial for precise predictions.\nAdditionally, to ensure uniformity in the impact of features, a conventional scalar approach is employed to recalibrate the coefficients of all features, aligning their means to 0 and standard deviations to 1, thereby mitigating potential biases stemming from feature scale discrepancies. Within the database, classification is facilitated by delineating between two distinct classes: class 0 and class 1, representing the absence and presence of heart disease, respectively. Specifically, 164 cases are attributed to class 0, indicative of the absence of heart disease, while 139 instances are categorized as class 1, denoting the presence of heart disease. To mitigate the inherent class imbalance, the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) is deployed, ensuring equitable representation of both classes and bolstering the model’s predictive prowess across diverse scenarios.\nImplementation of the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) within the research framework entails a systematic approach to redress the inherent class imbalance between class 0 (indicating the absence of heart disease) and class 1 (signifying the presence of heart disease). SMOTE functions by generating synthetic samples from the minority class, thereby augmenting its representation within the dataset. This technique involves selecting individual instances from the minority class and creating synthetic instances along the line segments connecting them to their nearest neighbors. By interpolating between existing instances, SMOTE effectively enhances the diversity of the minority class without introducing biases, thus fostering a balanced representation of both classes. This approach fortifies the model’s predictive capabilities, ensuring robust performance across a myriad of scenarios and enhancing its utility in clinical practice.\nSpecifically, SMOTE facilitates equitable representation of both classes, enabling the model to learn from a more diverse range of examples and effectively capture the underlying patterns and nuances associated with both the presence and absence of heart disease. As a result, the predictive model becomes more adept at accurately discerning between cases of heart disease and non-heart disease, thereby enhancing its diagnostic precision and reliability. Additionally, by mitigating the impact of class imbalance, SMOTE contributes to the model’s generalizability and robustness, ensuring consistent performance across diverse patient populations and clinical settings. Overall, the integration of SMOTE into the proposed model significantly enhances its predictive capabilities, ultimately empowering healthcare practitioners with a more effective tool for accurate heart disease diagnosis and prognosis.\nThe methodology generates artificial instances of underrepresented categories, achieving a balanced distribution across both types. The process of classification involves the use of chosen characteristics and using various classifiers such as support vector machine (SVM)21, PCA22, linear discriminant analysis (LDA)23, naïve Bayes (NB)24, decision tree (DT)25, and random forest (RF)26. Ultimately, the classifier predicts an individual’s presence or absence of heart disease. The mechanism used in the suggested approach for heart disease forecasting is shown in Fig. 1.\nPre-processing\nThis first phase is the primary step of the diagnostic procedure. The process consists of three stages: substituting absent qualities, eliminating duplications, and segregation. A characteristic’s missing value is substituted after a comprehensive examination of the patient’s age category, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure levels. If the majority of attribute values of a patient exhibit similarity, the corresponding value is replaced in the same spot. The redundancy reduction process aims to decrease the quantity of data by eliminating redundant or useless qualities. The patients are categorized according to the specific form of chest pain they exhibit, namely: (1) classic angina, (2) atypical angina, (3) non-anginal suffering, and (4) asymptomatic suffering.\nFeature selection\nThe GA is founded on the principles of natural selection. The algorithm produces many solutions within a single generation. Each solution is referred to as a genome. The aggregate of solutions within a single generation is often called the population. The algorithm undergoes several iterations across generations to provide an improved result. During each process iteration, genetic algorithms are used on genomes derived from previous generations to generate the generation. Selection, crossovers, and mutations are genetic operators often used in genetic algorithms.\nThe selection agent is responsible for choosing the most optimal people from every age group. A fitness function assesses each person’s fitness level about others within the general population. The genomes that a selection agent chooses are then put into the mating pool, contributing to the formation of the following generation. The crossover agent is a genetic algorithm technique that combines individuals from mating pools to generate improved offspring for generations. Various crossover agents exist, including single-point, two-point, and multipoint crossover. If a mixture is not introduced into the general population, individuals in the following generation will likely exhibit similarities to the preceding population. The variety is presented using a mutation manager, which introduces random alterations to the individuals. The process of the genetic algorithm’s development is shown in Fig. 2.\nA total of 18 iterations have been used. A total of 80 genomes were chosen in every successive generation. A total of 40 optimal genomes were selected at each age and then transmitted to the next generation. A total of 40 genomes were picked randomly. A crossover rate of 5% and a mutation rate 0.05 were used. The user’s data is negated. The fitness of the genomes was determined by using the mean square error of the genome as the objective function. The RFEM method is an iterative process that recursively eliminates unnecessary characteristics. The classifier undergoes training using the provided training data, and afterward, the significance of the features is determined by calculation. The least influential elements are eliminated during each process iteration, and the model is retrained using the remaining subset of features. The procedures are executed iteratively until the necessary quantity of features is attained. The method receives the number of characteristics to be maintained as a parameter. The functionality of the RFEM method is shown in Fig. 3.\nHeart feature extraction\nThe investigation involves the extraction of diverse attributes from the medical data obtained via healthcare devices. The database comprises several physiological measurements, including heart rate, arterial pressure, and blood sugar level. To accurately determine the presence of cardiac disease, it is essential to extract critical characteristics, including statistical and temporal aspects. The equations provided below constitute the list of feature extraction.\nThe maximum voltage, total harmonic distortion (THD), heart rate, zero crossing rate (ZCR), entropy (ent), energy (eg), and standard deviation (SD) are expressed in Eqs. (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7).\nThe voltage is denoted V, the harmonic component is denoted HC, the probability of frequency filter is denoted \\({P}_{ff}\\), the signal change and signal no change are expressed \\({S}_{c} {\\text{and}} {S}_{nc}\\). The probability is expressed \\({P}_{xy}\\), and the deviation is denoted k. The collected data contains an interval referred to as RR. The variation is expressed in Eq. (8).\nThe variable M represents the aggregate count of RR intervals in the database. The root mean square of the sum of the consecutive differences is expressed in Eq. (9).\n\\({RR}_{x}\\) refers to the integrated heartbeat, k represents the mean value, and \\({P}_{xy}\\) signifies the probability value. The qualities have been derived from the medical gadget data. The retrieved properties are retained as factors to forecast heart disease and alterations in the heart pattern. The ensuing section explains the intricate procedure involved in identifying heart disease.\nCluster-based over-sampled method\nA novel approach has been devised using resampling and grouping methodologies to handle unbalanced stroke data. Resampling techniques include both under sampling and oversampling methods. Under sampling is a technique to remove data points from the majority class specimens selectively. Oversampling is used to augment the representation of minority specimens. Grouping is the process of grouping data so that models within each group exhibit similar qualities.\nFigure 4 illustrates the primary operations inside the system that has been developed. The method performs an under sampling function on collecting specimens with majority labels. Clustering is performed on the subset of minority labels within the overall data set. The example set generated by the underestimating procedure is separated into distinct testing, training, and validation sets. This division is done according to the ratio of 8:1:1. The acquired training sets have been combined. The validation sets, and testing sets have been completed. Next, the SMOTE algorithm performs oversampling on the specimens with minority labels inside the merged training set, resulting in the acquisition of the final stage of training data27. In the concluding training set, the quantity of positive tests is about equivalent to the number of negative specimens, and each category of positive model is comprised. This training database offers an abundant number of examples that are used for the training of machine learning algorithms to extract characteristics. The method generates balanced activity, verification, and testing sets.\nFigure 5 illustrates the UCOM process for heart disease prediction. The UCOM algorithm is comprised of three distinct parts. The number of individuals without heart attacks is much larger than those without, so the data set of individuals without heart attacks is underrepresented. The random underestimating procedure resulted in the selection of specimen number 120. The prediction outcome achieved with a specimen count of 120 demonstrates superior performance. A clustering operation is performed on the specimens associated with heart attacks to ensure the inclusion of distinct characteristics from each subgroup of close-distance data throughout the training process. To get a balanced distribution of specimens with and without heart attacks throughout the training, oversampling is used for the models with heart attacks.\n-\n(1) The use of under sampling techniques to the majority class of negative specimens, namely those about stroke without heart attack cases. Most specimens, namely those without heart attack but with stroke, were picked randomly to create three subsets: a training subset, a validation subset, and a testing subset. The UCOM technique incorporates the parameter of randomized pick specimens, which depends on the data collection characteristics and the specimen set representing the minority label. The ratio of models with a heart attack to specimens without cardiac attack in the MIMIC-III database is 2:3, indicating an under sampling percentage28. In the MIMIC-III database, the stroke specimens database entails randomly selecting two-thirds of the stroke specimens, excluding those that include heart attacks.\n-\n(2) Clustering the specimen set consisting of minority labels, namely stroke and heart attack data, is being performed.\nThe research used a clustering algorithm to aggregate minority specimens, namely stroke specimens with cardiac arrest, into several clusters. Next, divide each group into three sets: the set for training, validation, and testing set. This division should be done by the ratio 8:1:1. The number of K is obtained by calculating the mean square error. The computation of the Sum of Squared Errors (SSE) is represented by Eq. (10).\n$$E=\\sum_{i=0}^{{C}_{x}}{\\left|i-{m}_{x}\\right|}^{2}$$(10)\\({C}_{x}\\) represents the x-th cluster, \\(i\\) denotes the specimen inside \\({C}_{x}\\), and \\({m}_{x}\\) refers to the centroid of \\({C}_{x}\\)\n-\n(3) The process of dividing and combining clusters.\nThe underspecified specimens and each cluster are divided into training, validation, and testing sets using an 8:1:1 ratio. These sets are combined to create a new activity, validation, and testing set. The three newly introduced groups consist of training, verification, and testing sets.\n-\n(4) One approach to address the class imbalance in the training set is to use the SMOTE to specimen the pseudo training set.\nSMOTE method is a sampling technique designed to address imbalanced databases by generating synthetic specimens for the minority class. The method exhibits enhancements above the random sampling approach. The pseudo training set should be inputted into the SMOTE algorithm. The method employs a random selection process to choose specimens with a minority label and then identifies the closest neighbors. The system produces additional models with the minority label inside the set of centering specimens and their corresponding neighbour’s. The algorithm continues its execution until the count of samples with the minority label equals the count of models with the majority label. At this point, it produces the updated training set.\nClassification method\nThe MLDCNN is a deep-learning neural network that utilizes the AEHOM for weight value optimization. Following the process of feature selection, the selected features are subjected to classification using the MLDCNN. The MLDCNN classifier receives each chosen component as its input in this context. The weights are arbitrarily given values associated with each piece of information. The concealed nodes inside the succeeding concealed layer compute the sum of the input value multiplied by the weight vector associated with all the input nodes connected to it. Random weight values have been shown to enhance the efficacy of the backpropagation process in obtaining the desired outcome. The optimization process is conducted in this manner. The activation procedure is then used, and the output of this layer is sent to the subsequent layer. The weights have a significant impact on the work of the classifier. The classification process in the MLDCNN involves a series of algorithmic phases, outlined as follows.\nStep 1: Eqs. (11), (12) represent the feature values and their corresponding weights.\nThe symbol \\({F}_{x}\\) represents the input value, which represents a selection of n features denoted as \\({F}_{1},{F}_{2},\\cdots ,{F}_{m}\\). Similarly, \\({W}_{x}\\) represents the weight value of \\({F}_{x}\\), which shows the appropriate weights for the n features as \\({W}_{1},{W}_{2},\\cdots ,{W}_{m}\\).\nStep 2: The inputs are multiplied by weight vectors that have been randomly selected, and the resulting products are then summed using Eq. (13).\nThe input and the weight are denoted \\(F, and W\\). \\(M\\) represents the aggregate value.\nStep 3: The objective is to ascertain that the activation function is expressed in Eq. (14) and the classification function is expressed in Eq. (15).\nThe symbol \\({A}_{{f}_{x}}\\) represents the activation operation, whereas \\({C}_{x}\\) represents the exponential of \\({F}_{x}\\). The suggested system employs a Gaussian function as a kind of activation function.\nStep 4: Assess the hidden layer output using a rigorous evaluation using Eq. (16).\nThe bias value is denoted as \\({B}_{x}\\), whereas the weight across the hidden input and layers is specified as \\({W}_{x}\\). The classification function is denoted \\({C}_{x}\\).\nStep 5: The three processes above are executed for every layer inside the MLDCNN. The output unit is assessed by aggregating the weights of every input signal to get the values of the neurons in the layer that produces signals expressed in Eq. (17).\nThe variable \\({O}_{x}\\) represents the value of the level that comes before the resultant layer, \\({W}_{x}\\) identifies the layer weights concealed, and \\({R}_{x}\\) denotes the measurement unit of the output.\nStep 6: This stage involves the comparison of the output generated by the network with the desired target value. The disparity between these two quantities is often called the error signal. The mathematical expression for this disparity is expressed in Eq. (18).\nThe error indication, denoted as \\({E}_{x}\\), represents the discrepancy between the actual and desired output, specified by \\({D}_{x}\\). In this step, a comparison is made between the value of the output metric and the goal value. The associated mistake is identified. The error at the output is sent back to all other devices in the network by computing a value \\({k}_{x}\\) according to this mistake, denoted in Eq. (19).\nHeart rate is denoted \\({R}_{x}\\), and the error disparity is expressed \\({E}_{x}\\).\nStep 7: The use of the backpropagation technique achieves the weight adjustment. The provided relation is presented in Eq. (20).\nThe weight adjustment is denoted by \\({W}_{{c}_{x}}\\), the momentum is represented by \\(\\alpha\\), and \\({k}_{x}\\) refers to the mistake dispersed throughout the network. The weight values are adjusted using the AEHOM technique.\nAEHOM\nThe AEHOM framework is based on the notion that the elephant population is divided into several clans. Each clan has a distinct quantity of elephants. Typically, male elephants separate from their clans and choose a solitary lifestyle. The leadership of each clan is entrusted to the oldest female elephant, commonly called the matriarch. In a herd of elephants, the matriarchs are known to choose the most favorable option, whereas the male elephants’ attitude indicates the least favorable alternative. The elephant population is divided into several clans. Every individual, denoted as v, belonging to a particular family, indicated as c, is directed by the matriarch, denoted as \\({E}_{n}\\), who has the most significant fitness value within the given generation. The procedure above is represented by Eq. (21).\n\\({P}_{x+1,{E}_{n,v}}\\) denotes the updated position of the variable u in the context of the algorithm c. \\({P}_{x,{E}_{n}}\\) reflects the prior location of u, while \\({P}_{{E}_{n,v}}\\) signifies the optimal solution of \\({E}_{n,v}\\). The variable c, which belongs to the interval [0, 1], determines the impact of the matriarch in the procedure. \\({R}_{D}\\) is a random number employed to enhance population diversity during the method's later phases. The optimal location of the elephant inside clan \\({P}_{x+1,{E}_{n,v}}\\) is revised via Eq. (22).\nThe symbol l represents a parameter within the range of [0, 1]. This variable significantly determines how \\({P}_{c,{E}_{n}}\\) influences the overall outcome, as shown in Eq. (23).\nThe variable \\({b}_{{E}_{n},y,l}\\) represents the yth dimension, where l is more than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to L. The variable L represents the total width of the space. \\(V{E}_{n}\\) symbolizes the number of elephants in clan c.\nMale elephants that separate from their social group are used to conduct exploratory activities. A subset of elephants exhibiting the lowest fitness values within each clan is assigned new locations, as Eq. (24) shows\nThe variables are defined as follows: \\({P}_{min}\\) represents the lower limit of the searching space. \\({P}_{max}\\) represents the upper bound of the searching area. The variable k is constrained to the interval [0, 1]. A stochastic variable generated from a uniform probability distribution.\nAfter evaluating the placements of the elephants, mutation and crossing procedures are implemented to enhance the optimization process. The use of a two-point crossover is implemented. This approach involves the selection of two sites on the parental genome. The genetic material between these two specific locations undergoes reciprocal exchange between the parent’s genomes, resulting in the acquisition of the offspring’s genome. These points are evaluated in Eqs. (25) and (26).\nThe mutation process (\\({P}_{x+1,{E}_{n}}\\)) entails exchanging a certain number of genes from each genome with novel genes. The exchanged genes refer to the genetically modified genes intentionally introduced into the genome without duplication. The procedure is iteratively executed until a solution exhibiting a higher fitness level is achieved.\nThe presented technique incorporates a comprehensive approach to predicting cardiac disease, which involves feature selection, data preparation, and machine learning algorithms. The data about patients is extracted and processed, resulting in the identification of valuable aspects. These characteristics are used in advanced machine learning methods, such as ensemble deep learning and classification methodologies. This merger aims to enhance precision and expedite the prognosis of cardiac disease with accuracy.\nSimulation analysis and findings\nThe performance of the suggested strategy is evaluated via thorough testing in the simulation part. Multiple metrics, including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision, are calculated to assess the predictive efficacy of the methodology. The effectiveness of the suggested strategy is validated by a comparative study conducted against current models.\nDatabases\nThe UCI machine learning database, comprising four databases including the Cleveland database29, the Hungary database30, the Switzerland database31, and the Long Beach database, was utilized to gather data on heart illness32. Specifically, the Cleveland database was selected for this study due to its widespread use among machine learning researchers and its provision of comprehensive information. With a total of 303 entries, the Cleveland database originally contained 76 characteristics, although the dataset available in the repository includes information for only a subset of 14 features. Sourced primarily from the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, the Cleveland database serves as the primary data source for this study. The prediction of heart disease involves the consideration of 13 qualities, with one attribute serving as the output or anticipated attribute indicating the existence of heart disease in a patient.\nNotably, the database from Cleveland includes a feature called “num,” which represents the finding of heart disease in individuals on a scale ranging from 0 to 4. A numerical value of 0 signifies the absence of heart illness, while values from 1 to 4 denote individuals afflicted with heart disease, with the scale indicating the degree of severity (with four being the most severe). Additionally, the study employed a modified bee method and k-fold cross-validation for robust analysis.\nExperimental setup for evaluation\nThe tests were conducted based on specific parameters and methodologies, including: (1) conducting the study using the entire database without employing any data-reducing methods, (2) experimenting with a reduced database by selecting a subset of the original data, and (3) experimenting with a modified bee method on the reduced database. The modified bee method, an adaptation of the traditional bee algorithm for optimization, was specifically tailored to enhance performance within the context of the study by iteratively exploring and optimizing parameters. These tests were executed on a system setup comprising an i5 CPU with 3 GB of RAM, utilizing the MATLAB 9.2 program for model construction. In each experiment, the data in the database was utilized to train and test the model, with different subsets or modifications applied as per the experimental conditions. Additionally, the study employed k-fold cross-validation, where the dataset was divided into k subsets, with each subset used as a testing set while the remaining data served as training sets. This process was repeated k times, and the performance metric computed the mean value over ‘k’ iterations to ensure robust evaluation of the model’s performance under varying conditions.\nSimulation results\nThe simulation results of the proposed method are analyzed, and the results are compared with the existing models.\nThe accuracy analysis depicted in Fig. 6 showcases the effectiveness of the machine learning hybrid deep predictive model (ML-HDPM) approach in predicting heart disease. Compared to other algorithms, ML-HDPM achieves notably higher training accuracy (95.5%) and testing accuracy (89.1%). This significant improvement is attributed to the integration of various advanced methodologies within the model. Firstly, ML-HDPM employs sophisticated feature selection techniques to identify the most relevant attributes related to cardiovascular health, thereby enabling the model to discern subtle patterns indicative of heart disease. Additionally, the utilization of data balancing techniques ensures that the model is trained on a representative sample of both positive and negative instances, leading to more accurate predictions. Furthermore, the incorporation of deep learning capabilities through the MLDCNN architecture allows the model to automatically learn intricate patterns and relationships within the data, further enhancing its predictive accuracy. Lastly, optimization using the adaptive elephant herding optimization methodology (AEHOM) fine-tunes the model parameters and weights, resulting in improved accuracy. Overall, the synergistic integration of these methodologies enables ML-HDPM to accurately predict heart disease, thus demonstrating its potential to enhance clinical decision-making and patient care.\nFigure 7 illustrates the precision analysis of heart disease prediction, showcasing the performance of the machine learning hybrid deep predictive model (ML-HDPM) technique. Notably, ML-HDPM achieves higher precision rates in both training (94.8%) and testing (88.3%) phases compared to alternative algorithms. This success can be attributed to the holistic approach adopted by ML-HDPM, which integrates several key methodologies. Firstly, the model employs advanced feature selection techniques to identify relevant attributes critical for accurate heart disease prediction. Additionally, ML-HDPM addresses data imbalances through effective data balancing methods, ensuring that the model is trained on a representative dataset. Moreover, the integration of deep learning capabilities using the MLDCNN architecture, enhanced by AEHOM optimization, further contributes to the model’s precision. By adeptly managing feature relevance and addressing data imbalances, ML-HDPM demonstrates enhanced accuracy in detecting heart disease patterns. These results underscore the importance of the proposed methodology in accurately diagnosing cardiac diseases, thus highlighting its significance in clinical decision-making and ultimately improving patient outcomes.\nFigure 8 depicts the false positive rate (FPR) analysis of various methods for predicting heart disease, with the machine learning hybrid deep predictive model (ML-HDPM) technique exhibiting notably lower FPR values during both training (8.2%) and testing (14.7%) phases compared to alternative methods. This accomplishment can be attributed to the synergistic utilization of feature selection, data balancing, and enhanced deep learning components within the ML-HDPM framework. By employing these strategies, the model enhances its capability to accurately identify instances that do not have heart disease, thereby reducing the number of cases falsely identified as positive. Consequently, the suggested approach demonstrates efficacy in minimizing misclassification errors, a crucial aspect for achieving precise predictions of cardiac diseases and ultimately improving patient care outcomes.\nFigure 9 illustrates the true positive rate (TPR) analysis across various algorithms for predicting heart disease, highlighting the machine learning hybrid deep predictive model (ML-HDPM) technique’s superior performance. During both training and testing phases, ML-HDPM achieves notably higher TPR values, with 96.2% and 90.8%, respectively. This success can be attributed to the comprehensive methodology employed by ML-HDPM, which encompasses the identification of relevant features, data balancing, and optimization of deep learning techniques. By leveraging these strategies, ML-HDPM effectively utilizes its feature-rich and balanced database to accurately detect true positives, resulting in an enhanced TPR. These results underscore the potential of ML-HDPM in bolstering the prediction of heart disease, thereby facilitating more precise diagnoses and ultimately leading to better patient outcomes.\nThe ML-HDPM technique has superior performance in terms of F-scores, achieving better scores in both training (91.5%) and testing (89.6%) compared to other algorithms. The F score results of the different models are expressed in Fig. 10. The success of this accomplishment is ascribed to the comprehensive nature of the methodology, which integrates feature selection, data balance, and deep learning optimization techniques. ML-HDPM successfully captures meaningful patterns in heart disease data, resulting in higher F-scores by establishing a balance between accuracy and recall. The results highlight the potential of ML-HDPM in accurately predicting heart disease, hence improving the whole diagnostic process and patient treatment.\nThe simulation findings presented in the study highlight the effectiveness of the machine learning hybrid deep predictive model (ML-HDPM) approach in accurately predicting heart disease. With a training accuracy of 95.5% and a testing accuracy of 89.1%, ML-HDPM outperforms other algorithms, demonstrating its exceptional performance in both sets. This superiority is further supported by the accuracy values of 94.8% for training and 88.3% for testing, underscoring the model’s effectiveness across different datasets expressed in Fig. 11. Moreover, ML-HDPM showcases a significant reduction in false positive rates (FPR), with rates of 8.2% during training and 14.7% during testing. This reduction in FPR is crucial as it indicates ML-HDPM’s ability to minimize misclassification errors, thereby improving the accuracy of heart disease prediction. Additionally, ML-HDPM exhibits higher true positive rates (TPR) compared to other algorithms, with rates of 96.2% during training and 90.8% during testing. These higher TPR values reflect ML-HDPM’s capability to accurately detect positive instances of heart disease, contributing to more reliable diagnostic outcomes.\nFurthermore, ML-HDPM achieves balanced F-scores of 91.5% during training and 89.6% during testing, indicating a harmonious blend of precision and recall in its predictions. This balance is crucial for ensuring accurate and reliable heart disease prediction. Regarding specificity, ML-HDPM demonstrates superior performance, with specificity rates of 89.7% in training and 84.2% in testing, surpassing other algorithms. This notable difference in specificity can be attributed to the comprehensive methodology employed by ML-HDPM, which integrates feature selection, data balance, and deep learning optimization techniques. By effectively reducing false positive rates and properly recognizing real negatives, ML-HDPM enhances the precision of heart disease diagnoses, thereby improving patient care outcomes.\nIn summary, the considerable differences observed among the obtained results, particularly in terms of accuracy, false positive rates, true positive rates, F-scores, and specificity, highlight the superior performance of the ML-HDPM approach in predicting heart disease. The comprehensive methodology and integrated techniques utilized by ML-HDPM contribute to its effectiveness in improving accuracy, reducing misclassification errors, and enhancing diagnostic reliability, ultimately leading to better patient care outcomes.\nConclusions\nThe research presents a comprehensive approach, ML-HDPM, aimed at enhancing the prediction of cardiovascular disease by addressing the limitations of traditional diagnostic methods. This approach combines various techniques such as feature selection, data balancing, and deep learning, utilizing the MLDCNN model improved with AEHOM.\nThe results of the study demonstrate promising performance metrics, with high training and testing accuracies, as well as precision rates. The approach also shows improvements in both false positive rates and true positive rates, indicating its potential for accurate prediction while minimizing false alarms. Additionally, the balanced F-scores suggest that the methodology maintains a good balance between precision and recall. These findings suggest that ML-HDPM has the potential to significantly improve the precision of diagnostic assessments for cardiovascular disease, thereby assisting healthcare professionals in making timely and accurate clinical decisions. However, the research also acknowledges the need for further exploration and refinement of the methodology, particularly regarding challenges related to data quality, feature selection, and optimization techniques. Future investigations should aim to expand the scope of inquiry to encompass a broader range of cardiovascular conditions and explore the practical implementation of the findings in real-world healthcare settings. Overall, the study underscores the transformative impact of advanced machine learning methodologies in improving the prediction and management of cardiovascular disease.\nData availability\nThe data presented in this study are available upon request from the corresponding author.\nCode availability\nThe custom code used in this study is openly available and can be accessed via https://github.com/prabukiwi1/Heart-Disease-Diagnosis.

This work contributes to the discourse on responsible AI use in healthcare, offering a blueprint for institutions to navigate the complexities of AI integration responsibly and effectively, thus promoting better, more equitable healthcare outcomes.\nSimilar content being viewed by others\nIntroduction\nThe integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into medicine has advanced markedly, initially making significant strides in medical imaging domains such as radiology, dermatology, pathology, and gastroenterology1. Deep learning models have shown remarkable capabilities, from detecting malignant breast lesions in X-rays2 to identifying diabetic retinopathy in fundus imaging3 and lung nodules in computed tomography scans4, among other applications. Beyond imaging, these models show promise in enhancing clinical decision-making, providing treatment recommendations, and facilitating patient triage5,6,7.\nThe advent of large language models (LLMs) has further expanded AI’s potential in healthcare, showing the potential to improve tasks such as history taking, patient summarization, generation of discharge summaries, procedural coding, and even provision of diagnostic recommendations8.\nAs with other healthcare technologies—such as electronic health records, clinical decision support, and telemedicine—large language models necessitate scrutiny, validation, and ongoing safety monitoring. Beyond past considerations such as usability, patient privacy, workflow adaptation, and training procedures9, AI presents a new set of challenges, such as variability in model performance across different healthcare settings due to out-of-distribution shifts, performance changes over time due to evolving disease prevalence, changes in patient demographics, and the introduction of new medical technologies10,11. LLMs, in particular, face heightened scrutiny over their capacity to generate inaccurate or irrelevant content, the risk of fabricating non-existent information (hallucinations), omitting crucial details in the documentation, and navigating data privacy intricacies during training phases12,13.\nIn response to these rapid developments, regulatory bodies like the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have begun to adapt quickly. However, clear benchmarks for assessing AI models and monitoring their performance over time remain elusive. Leading entities, including the Office of the National Coordinator14, the White House’s AI Bill of Rights blueprint15,16, the Coalition for Health AI (CHAI)17, the World Health Organization18, corporations such as Microsoft19, and professional associations like the American Medical Association20, have begun to establish high-level guidelines. These guidelines emphasize transparency, accountability, equity, privacy, security, safety, reliability, and robustness in AI applications. Despite these efforts, a tangible gap exists in the practical implementation of these guidelines and ongoing oversight of AI within healthcare settings.\nTo bridge this gap, we have developed a comprehensive set of guidelines that encompasses the entire range of AI systems within healthcare, ranging from traditional machine learning models to advanced generative AI technologies. By presenting a detailed case study on the application of this framework to ambient documentation, we emphasize the practicality and immediate relevance of our methodology. Our goal is to provide a foundational blueprint for healthcare institutions, ensuring AI is integrated responsibly and effectively across the healthcare sector.\nMethods\nCrafting guidelines for AI integration in healthcare settings\nWe brought together a cross-functional team of 18 people from our integrated academic healthcare system, including leaders from informatics, legal, research, data analytics, privacy, patient experience, equity, quality, and safety. We first identified critical themes through a peer-reviewed and gray literature search using terms like “AI governance in healthcare”, “AI guidelines/implementations”. Based on this search and our expert consensus approach (using Delphi-like methodology), we focused on nine principles: (1) Fairness, (2) Equity, (3) Robustness, (4) Privacy, (5) Safety, (6) Transparency, (7) Explainability, (8) Accountability, and (9) Benefit (summarized in Table 1). Additionally, recognizing the importance of collaboration across healthcare organizations for AI assurance to ensure AI ethics are upheld collectively, avoiding duplication of efforts, and enhancing AI implementation quality, we worked with other healthcare institutions and participated in industry collaborations.\nTo delve further into specifics, we established three focused groups to refine our guidelines: (1) Fairness and Privacy; (2) Transparency, Accountability, and Benefit; and (3) Robustness and Safety, each group had 4, 7, and 5 expert members respectively These insights were integrated into official guidelines for AI governance, incorporating appropriate considerations across institutional stakeholders (Fig. 1).\nOperationalizing AI deployment guidelines\nFollowing the establishment of comprehensive AI integration guidelines, our focus shifted toward the development and execution of a structured framework to facilitate their application within the healthcare setting. This effort was co-led by the innovation, digital, and data science teams.\nOur AI deployment guidelines had to mirror these teams’ existing protocols yet also consider the unique considerations of AI technologies across the Mass General Brigham (MGB) system. We adapted the standard digital work intake and created a specialized technology assessment tool. Our standard intake process evaluates project alignment with organizational priorities and digital strategy, technical feasibility, resource requirements, and project leadership assignments. The specialized assessment tool was specifically designed to address the distinct aspects of AI applications, such as the datasets employed for training and validation, development methods, performance evaluation metrics, potential risks, limitations, and ongoing monitoring parameters.\nThe preliminary evaluation stage culminates in a consultative session with the respective vendor or research team. This meeting is pivotal, allowing for an in-depth discussion on the proposed metrics, the frequency and nature of model updates, monitoring and the formulation of a strategy for the subsequent shadow deployment phase. The shadow deployment phase allows the AI systems to operate parallel to existing workflows without impacting patient care, allowing for a real-time evaluation and optimization of the technology under actual working conditions.\nFollowing the shadow deployment, our evaluation of AI systems encompasses a range of key metrics, ensuring their efficacy and seamless integration into clinical settings. Among these metrics, we prioritize assessing fairness across patient demographics, collecting provider feedback to gauge user experience, and examining workflow integration and usability to assess scalability, cost-effectiveness, clinical impact, and performance stability over time. These metrics provide a framework for evaluating the AI systems’ effectiveness and practicality in real-world healthcare environments.\nResults\nEstablishing AI integration guidelines in healthcare: outcomes and principles\nThrough this process, we identified key components critical to responsible AI implementation, providing a more detailed analysis than what is available in existing frameworks. (Table 1; Sup 1) Upholding our commitment to fairness, we mandated diverse training datasets as a standard requirement to mitigate bias. Going further would be the evaluation of outcomes with an equity lens, and subsequent model reengineering to ensure equitable outcomes. Equally crucial is the transparent communication of systems’ FDA status, specifying whether FDA approval is required and, if so, its current approval status, to ensure compliance and foster trust.\nOur team is committed to actively monitoring AI systems, promptly addressing performance issues, and ensuring equity, robustness, and accountability. A risk-based approach should be taken to this monitoring, such that those applications that potentially introduce greater risk to care outcomes are monitored more robustly than those with minimal or no risk to clinical outcomes. An AI operations committee is being established to lead and provide oversight to this effort.\nOur aim is to maintain stringent documentation and transparent communication, enabling informed decision-making regarding AI tools in patient care. While autonomous AI enhances administrative efficiency, we currently enforce stringent human oversight in all clinical decision-making processes to help ensure patient safety. Our protocol also mandates intensified monitoring procedures to effectively navigate associated risks and uncertainties, especially for high-risk AI systems, including those utilizing LLMs.\nThe process of establishing these guidelines was not without challenges, as finding common meeting times for all leaders proved difficult. However, forming smaller, specialized groups proved beneficial, allowing leaders with relevant expertise to collaborate effectively. Ultimately, bringing the outcomes back to the larger team was essential, ensuring a unified approach across all departments.\nFramework for AI implementation in healthcare: a case study of ambient documentation\nIn our effort to establish a robust framework for AI implementation across all AI types, we selected generative AI, specifically its application in ambient documentation systems, as a representative case study to illustrate our approach. This choice was driven by the inherent monitoring challenges associated with generative AI technologies. Ambient documentation exemplifies an AI application that records conversations between patients and clinicians to generate draft clinical notes, which clinicians subsequently review and refine before finalizing the medical records.\nWe first implemented a pilot study involving a select group of individuals from various departments.\nIn prioritizing this organization-wide application, we focused on security and privacy, sharing deidentified data with the vendor to enable continuous model updates and improvements. We collaborated closely with the vendor on strict de-identification processes, data retention policies, and the controlled use of data solely for enhancing the model’s performance. Crucially, we prohibited long-term storage and use of recordings because the recordings cannot be de-identified, thereby safeguarding the privacy and security of both patients and clinicians.\nAs an integral component of our transparency and explainability framework, this initial phase allowed for an in-depth assessment of the system’s functionality and the collection of targeted feedback, crucial for identifying potential issues early in the implementation process. We employed a set of metrics for evaluation, including system usage, the percentage of notes retained after edits by clinicians to evaluate clinical impact, and feedback in both numeric and free-text formats to assess performance. These metrics were monitored over time to identify any discernible trends.\nTo ensure accountability, we require that all clinical messages generated by the system be reviewed and edited by clinicians before being sent to patients.\nWhile focusing on patient benefit, we acknowledge the inability to measure quality based on demographics—due to the lack of linkage between these data and electronic health records—our existing metrics have underscored the tool’s capability to be effectively utilized across the entire organization. Recognizing the diversity of our user base, we placed significant emphasis on testing the AI tool across a spectrum of users, including patients and providers, to ensure its robustness irrespective of one’s primary language, accent, or the presence of an interpreter during clinical visits. This testing approach led to the selection of vendors that demonstrated proficiency in drafting clinical visit notes in scenarios involving non-English languages and interpreters.\nDuring the shadow deployment, most users were from the Emergency Medicine and Internal Medicine Departments. There were no specific Feedback trends, but the average scores were mostly in the range of 3–5, with 5 being the best possible score. Most criticisms targeted the documentation of physical examinations, potentially reflecting the less intuitive nature of vocalizing physical exam findings in the presence of a patient compared to the more fluid process of recounting the history of the present illness, which received positive remarks. Furthermore, there were appreciative comments on the system’s efficiency in documenting encounters with patients who have strong accents or with an interpreter present.\nOur next steps will focus on expanding the pilot to include more departments, capturing a wider variety of clinical cases and patient demographics. This expansion is critical to ensure that the AI system’s translation accuracy remains robust across different races, primary languages, ages, and sexes. Additionally, by involving a more diverse group of providers, we aim to account for diversity in medical scenarios and in interview and note-writing styles. This will further enhance the system’s adaptability to varying clinical workflows and provider preferences, ensuring effectiveness across the organization.\nAs we expand, training and support will be critical to help clinicians understand how to effectively integrate this AI tool into their practice. This training will address both technical use and awareness of the system’s limitations, including potential omissions, hallucinations and inaccuracies.\nDiscussion\nThe process of integrating AI into healthcare presents both significant opportunities and challenges. Our initiative builds upon the existing foundation laid by various organizations, focusing on essential principles such as fairness, equity, robustness, privacy, safety, transparency, explainability, and accountability, with an added emphasis on the tangible benefits for patients, healthcare providers, and the organization at large.\nThe establishment of a multidisciplinary committee was a strategic step that facilitated smooth deliberations and decision-making. By aligning core values and priorities from the outset, the committee was able to navigate complex issues effectively. The adoption of a use-case approach for scenarios with ambiguous or conflicting requirements underscores the flexibility and adaptability of our framework. This approach ensures that while maintaining consistency with our core values, we can tailor AI integration to specific contexts, thereby avoiding one-size-fits-all solutions that may not serve the diverse needs of our patient population.\nThe reflective process initiated by our AI integration efforts has broadened our perspective on patient equity and fairness. It has prompted us to reconsider not only AI-related technologies but also other aspects of healthcare provision that may have previously been accepted without sufficient scrutiny for bias or inequity. This introspection is a testament to the transformative potential of AI in catalyzing more equitable healthcare practices.\nOngoing monitoring and reassessment of AI systems are critical, given the dynamic nature of both the technology and the healthcare landscape. Unlike static technologies, AI models evolve based on new data, changing clinical practices, and patient demographics. This evolution necessitates a proactive approach to ensure that AI tools remain effective, ethical, and aligned with our healthcare goals. Collaboration with vendors is essential in this context, as their insights and updates to AI models play a crucial role in maintaining system performance and relevance.\nOur exploration of generative AI in ambient documentation has shed light on the specific challenges associated with monitoring these technologies. Despite the lack of straightforward metrics for performance evaluation, we have developed a framework centered on clinical outcomes and clinician feedback. As we continue to expand AI applications within healthcare, a critical area of focus will be the analysis of performance across different demographics to ensure equity and effectiveness. Engaging a broad spectrum of users in providing feedback will be vital in refining these technologies to meet the diverse needs of the healthcare community effectively. Further, these processes involved considerable manual effort. Automating the collection of key metrics and alerting when metrics change beyond pre-determined points will be important as these tools scale.\nConclusion\nWe have outlined a methodology for integrating AI into healthcare settings, emphasizing the establishment of comprehensive guidelines and operational frameworks applicable across the spectrum of AI tools. Our multidisciplinary approach provides a blueprint for healthcare institutions, non-profit organizations, and governmental agencies seeking to implement and monitor AI technologies responsibly.\nOur case study on ambient documentation, which utilizes generative AI, illustrates the practical application of our framework. While focusing on this specific use case, we described challenges and opportunities common to many AI implementations in healthcare. The case study underscores the importance of continuous monitoring, evaluation, and adaptation of AI systems to maintain their relevance and effectiveness in changing clinical environments. By engaging in proactive dialog with vendors and incorporating diverse clinician and patient feedback, we ensure that AI tools enhance healthcare outcomes while upholding ethical standards.\nThe integration of AI into healthcare is an evolving journey, requiring ongoing commitment to ethical considerations, performance monitoring, and stakeholder engagement. Our report offers a starting point for healthcare institutions to develop and refine their processes for the responsible integration of AI, advocating for a dynamic, responsive approach to AI deployment in healthcare settings. To further this endeavor, our study underscores the importance of fostering cross-institutional and public-private partnerships. These collaborations are envisioned to amplify the impact of our findings, paving the way for wider accessibility of AI technologies. By not requiring each organization to undertake the extensive assessments we conducted, we aim to streamline the adoption process. These strategic alliances will play a crucial role in scaling up AI deployment while maintaining stringent quality and ethical standards.\nAs we move forward, it is imperative that we continue to evaluate and refine these guidelines, ensuring they keep pace with technological advancements and the evolving needs of patients and healthcare providers alike.\nChange history\n30 January 2025\nA Correction to this paper has been published: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41746-025-01445-0\nReferences\nRajpurkar, P. et al.

Image: Unsplash/Accuray\n- Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming healthcare by improving diagnostic accuracy, enabling earlier disease detection and enhancing patient outcomes.\n- Effective and ethical AI solutions in healthcare require collaboration among AI engineers, data scientists, domain experts, and other stakeholders, which results in more effective AI models.\n- AI-driven diagnostics are democratizing healthcare by making early and accurate diagnoses more accessible, especially in regions with limited access to specialized medical professionals.\nThe healthcare sector is poised for a revolution, with artificial intelligence (AI) playing a pivotal role in transforming how we diagnose and treat diseases.\nAI’s ability to process vast amounts of data quickly and accurately is reshaping the landscape, offering new ways to improve health outcomes globally.\nHowever, building effective and accurate solutions that are culturally sensitive and inclusive requires collaboration across the plethora of needed skill sets. The result is better and faster access to health solutions.\nThe promise of AI in healthcare\nAI’s potential in healthcare is vast, ranging from predictive analytics and personalized treatment plans to improving diagnostic accuracy. The sheer volume of medical data generated daily – from patient records, clinical trials, medical imaging and wearable devices – can be overwhelming for human practitioners.\nAs AI can analyze and learn from this data, patterns and correlations that may go unnoticed by human eyes can be detected. This leads to earlier and more accurate diagnoses, which is crucial in improving patient outcomes.\nOne of the most promising areas of AI in healthcare is in diagnostics. Traditional diagnostic methods often rely on the subjective interpretation of medical professionals, which can sometimes result in variability in outcomes. AI can reduce this variability by providing consistent, data-driven insights, leading to more reliable diagnoses.\nCollaboration key to robust AI healthcare\nCollaboration in AI development is essential for creating effective, ethical and impactful solutions to the world’s most pressing challenges, whether that includes AI engineers, data scientists and domain experts. “Such kind of collaboration across people from different sectors and regions help build more ethical and trustworthy AI solutions,” says Rudradeb Mitra, CEO of Omdena, a collaborative AI platform.\nIn the healthcare sector, Omdena applies AI to diagnostic processes, particularly in underserved communities. These models assist medical professionals in identifying diseases more accurately – such as tuberculosis and diabetic retinopathy – and at earlier stages, thereby increasing the chances of successful treatment.\nThese projects involve training AI algorithms on large datasets of medical images. Taking a collaborative approach ensures that the AI models are robust, culturally sensitive and adaptable to various healthcare settings.\nThe World Economic Forum is also driving digital healthcare transformation by fostering a global, multi-stakeholder approach to accelerate the responsible integration of digital health solutions into healthcare systems worldwide.\nBy collaborating with governments, businesses and civil society, the Forum focuses on improving healthcare access, outcomes and equity through innovative technologies while addressing challenges such as data privacy, cybersecurity and ethical use of AI in healthcare.\nBy integrating AI models into healthcare systems, particularly in regions with limited access to specialized medical professionals, we can democratize healthcare and ensure that more people have access to early and accurate diagnoses.\nImpact on health outcomes\nEarly diagnosis is often the key to successful treatment. Diseases like cancer, for example, have a significantly higher survival rate when detected early. When breast cancer is detected at stage one, the five-year survival rate is over 90%. Colorectal cancer yields a 14% five-year survival rate when diagnosed in later stages but can be around 90% with early diagnosis. Therefore, the impact of AI-driven diagnostics on health outcomes cannot be overstated.\n“This not only improves patient outcomes but also makes healthcare more accessible to all and reduces the burden on healthcare systems by preventing the progression of diseases to more advanced stages, which are often more difficult and expensive to treat,” says Mitra.\nFor example, Omdena's AI-powered app in Liberia predicts malaria outbreaks and identifies high-risk areas, enabling health officials to take proactive measures, particularly for vulnerable groups such as children and pregnant women.\nAI is also transforming oncology by enabling personalized cancer treatments through genomic analysis, identifying mutations and tailoring therapies to a patient's unique cancer profile. This approach improves treatment efficacy, reduces side effects and accelerates drug discovery.\nAI has also been used in the early detection and prediction of cardiovascular diseases. Machine learning is used to analyse ECGs, medical imaging, and patient data. With studies having shown impressive accuracy rates, including of heart disease classification of 93%, AI is improving diagnostics and offering noninvasive methods for assessing cardiovascular risks, potentially saving lives.\nThe future of AI in healthcare\nAs AI continues to evolve, its role in healthcare will only become more critical. The ability to predict, diagnose and treat diseases with greater accuracy and efficiency will lead to healthier populations and more sustainable healthcare systems.\nWe at Omdena have seen how important collaboration and innovation are in realizing AI’s full potential in healthcare.\nHowever, the mission is not just to build AI models; it’s about creating solutions that are inclusive, equitable and capable of making a real difference in people’s lives.\nBy leveraging the power of AI for diagnostics, we can improve health outcomes and contribute to a future where healthcare is more accessible and effective for everyone, particularly in the communities that need it the most.\nDon't miss any update on this topic\nCreate a free account and access your personalized content collection with our latest publications and analyses.\nLicense and Republishing\nWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.\nThe views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum.\nStay up to date:\nArtificial Intelligence\nRelated topics:\nForum Stories newsletter\nBringing you weekly curated insights and analysis on the global issues that matter.", "select_response": "<think>\nThe webpage provided focuses on the transformative role of AI in healthcare, particularly in improving diagnostics and health outcomes.

Introduction\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare, exploiting machine learning (ML) algorithms, data analytics, and automation, is enduring a paradigm transition by improving medical decision‐making, diagnosis, and treatment outcomes, with the potential to boost productivity, care quality, and ease costs [1]. The delivery, administration, and patient experience of healthcare are all being completely transformed by the advancement of AI‐driven technology and further its integration into existing systems [2, 3]. This in‐depth study looks at how AI is significantly impacting the healthcare sector, improving diagnostic precision through data analysis, streamlining treatment planning through predictive algorithms, and shedding light on how these advancements are challenging accepted wisdom and setting new benchmarks for quality [3, 4, 5]. Najjar (2023) showcased AI's revolutionary potential in several healthcare sectors. In diagnostics, AI‐powered diagnostic tools have shown remarkable accuracy in diagnosing diseases including cancer, heart issues, and neurological disorders, particularly in the area of medical imaging. These technologies frequently outperform human clinicians in this regard [6]. Their speed and precision have frequently surpassed that of human professionals. ML algorithms scan vast amounts of data from imaging studies, genomes, and medical records to identify patterns and predict patient outcomes, enabling earlier and more accurate diagnosis [4]. In addition to improving patient outcomes, AI‐powered expertise enables personalized treatment plans that cater to each patient's unique requirements and boost the effectiveness of treatments [5, 6]. By analyzing patient data to suggest tailored medication, AI improves treatment success and minimizes side effects [4, 5, 6]. These technologies can reduce hospital admissions and readmissions by remotely monitoring patients and alerting medical professionals to issues before they get worse [2, 3]. According to Alowais et al. (2023), AI is also greatly enhancing patient care and administrative effectiveness. Virtual health assistants driven by ML and NLP are increasingly being used to plan appointments, handle patient communications, and provide medical advice, all of which reduce the workload for medical staff [7]. Healthcare facilities operate more effectively, and resources are directed where they are most needed because to AI's capacity to manage massive information and optimize workflows [7]. By optimizing treatment plans, getting rid of unnecessary procedures, and improving diagnosis accuracy, AI has the potential to significantly reduce healthcare expenditures. Bajwa et. al. (2021) touched on one of the main factors influencing AI's adoption is its ability to lower healthcare expenses [1]. One of the primary drivers of AI adoption, according to Bajwa et al. (2021), is its potential to reduce healthcare costs [1]. Predictive analytics is a significant use of AI in healthcare that supports patient demand forecasting, population health management, and resource allocation. Since early detection and tailored treatment can prevent costly outcomes and hospital admissions, these qualities are particularly beneficial in the management of chronic illnesses [1, 3, 7].\nAI in healthcare must overcome several significant challenges if it is to live up to its full potential. Ethical concerns such as safeguarding patient privacy and avoiding bias in AI systems must be taken into consideration. There are concerns about data security and potential misuse because AI systems rely on massive amounts of data [3]. To ensure that the highest safety and efficacy standards are fulfilled and to oversee the development and use of AI technology in healthcare, robust regulatory frameworks are also necessary [8].\nAdditionally, for the healthcare industry to adopt AI, a cultural shift must occur. By automating processes like scheduling, billing, and patient triage and allocating resources optimally to cut down on wait times and enhance workflow overall, AI also increases operational competence [1, 3, 5]. Healthcare professionals must understand the benefits and drawbacks of AI technology and be ready to handle them. Collaboration between AI developers, healthcare practitioners, and legislators is essential to the development of systems that are not just technologically advanced but also aligned with the needs and values of patients and providers [7]. To enable prompt reactions, AI‐driven surveillance systems use ML algorithms to identify trends and early warning indicators of disease outbreaks [9, 58]. AI models forecast epidemics and track the spread of diseases like influenza, monkeypox, chikungunya and COVID‐19 by analyzing symptoms, travel records, and environmental data [6, 7, 8], helping public health officials allocate resources, implement prevention strategies, and tackle emergent health threats [3, 7].\nAt the outset, AI is more than just a technological advancement—it is what is propelling the advancement of healthcare. Its capacity to transform patient care, diagnostics, and operational effectiveness offers hope for a more individualized, effective, and accessible healthcare system in the future [8]. As AI develops, ethical, legal, and cultural issues must be carefully considered before integrating it into the healthcare industry. By overcoming these obstacles, AI can live up to its potential of revolutionizing healthcare into a more efficient and just system where human judgment and technological know‐how combine to provide better treatment [3, 7].\nThis review provides a comprehensive analysis of AI's implications for the healthcare sector, emphasizing how it affects operational effectiveness, treatment planning, and diagnosis. The following important sections make up the structure of the manuscript. The methodology is described in Section 2, which also includes information on the databases, keywords, inclusion/exclusion criteria, data extraction, and synthesis used in this investigation. Understanding AI in healthcare is examined in Section 3, market dynamics and the development of AI throughout time are examined in Section 4, and the use of AI in the healthcare industry is examined in Section 5. Recognizing the market dynamics, the growth of AI over time, and the critical role it has played in diagnostics, operational effectiveness, and patient care. While Section 7 concentrates on the main obstacles and worries regarding the deployment of AI in healthcare, Section 6 emphasizes the advantages of AI in the healthcare industry. Together with its disadvantages, which include ethical concerns, data privacy issues, and legal challenges, the benefits of AI, such as improved outcomes and reduced expenses have been examined. The current uses of AI in healthcare are reviewed in Section 8, and Section 9 looks at possible future developments and their ramifications. Additionally, several real‐world examples are provided, along with forecasts on future trends and implications, such as the possible impact of AI on healthcare and its continued integration.\n2.

Understanding Al in Healthcare\nAI is a disruptive force in the healthcare industry that involves novel ideas and changes in conventional methods. This section provides a thorough overview of AI in healthcare, including everything from its basic description to its current acceptance status [1, 3].\n3.1. What Is Al in Healthcare?\nThe development of computer systems capable of carrying out operations often associated with human intellect is known as AI. Within the healthcare domain, AI manifests through diverse modalities, including ML algorithms, NLP and robotics [4, 5]. These technological facets collectively empower machines to scrutinize intricate medical data, discern patterns, and render informed decisions. In effect, AI serves as a transformative augmentation of healthcare professionals’ capabilities [1, 5, 6]. AI in healthcare is a paradigm change that affects patient interaction, treatment plans, administrative procedures, and diagnosis. Improving patient outcomes, optimizing healthcare delivery, and raising the standard of care are the main objectives. AI is a flexible toolset rather than a single fix, providing a range of applications that address various facets of the healthcare environment [3, 4, 7].\n3.2. Types of Al in Healthcare\nML algorithms are essential to the healthcare industry because they make it easier to identify patterns and trends in large datasets. Another aspect of AI is NLP, which enables robots to understand and communicate with human language. This makes it easier to perform activities like voice‐activated devices or language‐based data analysis. Robots, a kind of AI, are used in healthcare through automated procedures and hands‐on support during procedures or patient care [6]. The hierarchical structure and interdependencies between AI, ML, and DL are depicted in Figure 2. As general AI concepts give way to the next generation of advanced, data‐driven learning performances, the correlations show how specificity and complexity increase from AI to DL.\nAI in healthcare comes in a variety of forms, each intended for a specific use. Rule‐based systems, for instance, make decisions based on preset criteria and are suitable for tasks like symptom screening [3, 4]. On the other hand, because ML algorithms can spot patterns in data, they are crucial for customized treatment regimens and diagnostic imaging. Applications like voice recognition and chatbots are made possible by NLP's facilitation of human‐computer communication [8]. Robotics is another area of AI that has applications in physical therapy and surgery. This demonstrates the range and complexity of AI's uses in healthcare [5].\nAI's rapid and accurate analysis of complicated medical data presents a promising path toward more accurate, data‐driven decision‐making in the healthcare industry, which will ultimately lead to better patient care and results [1, 5].\n3.3. Current State of Al Adoption in Healthcare\nAI's application in healthcare is being propelled by growing awareness of its potential benefits, data abundance, and technological advancements [3, 4]. In diagnostics, AI‐powered tools, such as X‐rays and MRIs, demonstrate remarkable accuracy in interpreting medical images, often outperforming traditional methods [6, 9]. Treatment personalization, leveraging ML algorithms, allows for tailored approaches based on individual patient profiles, optimizing therapeutic interventions [3, 10]. Administrative functions, including revenue cycle management and supply chain optimization, involve witnessing efficiency gains through AI‐driven automation [3]. Table 2 provides a crisp overview of each AI approach, including their applications, advantages, disadvantages, and references, offering a clearer understanding of their potential application and challenges in healthcare.\nTable 2.\n| AI/ML models [Ref.] | Details & application | Benefit | Drawback |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [61] | Through the creation of new chemical structures, or GANs, are essential to the development of medicinal products. They are made up of a discriminator network for assessing quality and a generator network for generating compounds, which together enable the production of many, well‐suited therapeutic candidates. |\n|\n|\n| Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) [54] | In drug discovery, RNNs are widely employed for tasks such as protein structure prediction, genomic data analysis, and peptide sequence design. RNNs are particularly good at identifying sequential relationships and creating new sequences based on patterns they have learned. |\n|\n|\n| Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) [41, 57] | CNNs are an effective tool for image‐based applications including drug target identification and chemical structure analysis. They take relevant information out of molecular pictures to help in target identification and medication design. |\n|\n|\n| Long short‐Term Memory Networks (LSTMs) [35] | Modeling and forecasting temporal relationships is a strong suit for RNN subtypes called LSTMs. They are useful for forecasting drug concentration‐time profiles, evaluating drug effectiveness, and conducting pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics research. |\n|\n|\n| Transformer Models (TMs) [43, 67] | TMs are used for NLP jobs in the pharmaceutical area, such as the popular BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model. They help researchers make well‐informed judgments on the development of new drugs by extracting important information from databases of patents, clinical trial data, and scientific literature. |\n|\n|\n| Reinforcement Learning (RL) [26] | Personalized treatment plans and optimal drug dosage methods are achieved through the application of RL approaches. By generating consecutive judgments that improve dosage optimization and patient outcomes, RL algorithms learn from interactions with the environment. |\n|\n|\n| Bayesian Models (BMs) [37, 44, 59, 71] | In drug development, BMs, such as Gaussian processes and Bayesian networks, are essential for quantifying uncertainty and making decisions. For researchers in the field, they aid in risk assessment, experimental design optimization, and probabilistic forecasts. |\n|\n|\n| Deep Q‐Networks (DQNs) [38, 49] | Drug discovery is optimized by applying DQNs, which combine RL and DL. By predicting chemical activity and suggesting promising candidates for additional testing, they improve the efficiency of the drug discovery process. |\n|\n|\n| Autoencoders (AEs) [32] | In drug development, AEs—unsupervised learning models are used for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction. They help with virtual screening and compound screening procedures by capturing important molecular features. |\n|\n|\n| Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) [55, 66] | Because they are designed to handle graph‐structured data, GNNs are perfect for drug discovery applications that involve chemical structures. They aid in de novo drug creation and virtual screening processes, efficiently model molecular graphs, and forecast features. |\n|\n|\nHowever, the current state of AI adoption is not without challenges. Although progressive businesses and important healthcare facilities welcome AI, obstacles to its broad adoption include a lack of resources, worries about data security, and the need for extensive legal frameworks [11, 12]. As technology advances, cooperation between software developers, medical practitioners, and government agencies is necessary to guarantee the appropriate and efficient application of AI [1, 5, 11]. Recognizing AI's diversity, ranging from complex ML algorithms to rule‐based systems, is essential for comprehending its application in healthcare [4, 5]. A summary of AI applications in healthcare shows how the technology has the potential to completely transform the sector, and the adoption process now reflects both advancements and challenges [3, 7]. To fully realize the promise of AI for improving healthcare delivery, we must continue to explore and collaborate as we traverse this revolutionary terrain [1, 4].\n4. Market Dynamics and the Evolution of Al Over the Years\n4.1. Global Healthcare Al Market\nHealthcare AI is estimated to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 47.6%, from $11.2 billion in 2023 to $427.5 billion by 2032. In recent years, North America has been the market leader for AI in healthcare, with over USD 6.5 billion in sales expected in 2022 [13].

Oncora, Koninklijke Philips N.V., Siemens, GE Healthcare, Medtronic, Google, Amazon, Intel, IBM, Johnson & Johnson Services Inc., and Microsoft are some of the industry leaders [13]. Figure 3 depicts the expansion of the Healthcare AI market, which is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 47.6%.\nThe market is anticipated to grow rapidly and offer substantial investment opportunities in AI‐driven healthcare technology over the next 10 years, from $11.2 billion in 2023 to $427.5 billion by 2032 [13]. The global healthcare AI market is experiencing significant growth driven by several key factors. Adoption of AI solutions has been fueled by the growing need for data‐driven healthcare practices, which allow for the analysis of large datasets and better patient outcomes [1, 3, 4]. The usage of healthcare AI, which provides tools for early identification, individualized treatment regimens, and ongoing patient monitoring, has also increased as a result of the growing burden of chronic diseases [1, 3]. Advances in ML and DL have improved the precision of therapy recommendations, predictive analytics, and diagnostic procedures [4, 5, 7].\nFurthermore, the incorporation of big data analytics facilitates improvements in clinical research, population health management, and personalized treatment. An environment that is favorable for the global spread of healthcare AI is being created by government initiatives and regulatory assistance [14, 15]. Adopting AI in healthcare is not without its challenges. Patients and healthcare professionals are concerned about using sensitive health data; therefore, data security and privacy issues continue to be major obstacles [12, 16].

A medical diagnosis is the identification of the disease or conditions that cause a person’s symptoms and signs. Usually, the patient’s medical history and physical examination provide diagnostic information. Diagnosing a medical condition can be difficult because many symptoms are ambiguous and can only be correctly identified by trained healthcare professionals. This can be a major problem in developing countries where doctors and other health professionals are scarce. Many people in these countries cannot get proper medical diagnosis and treatment for lack of healthcare professionals [2]. AI could be helpful for undeveloped regions [3]. The AI-based system [4, 5] is able to detect various diseases, such as kidney stone detection [6], heart disease prediction and detection [7], skin and lung cancer detection [8, 9], diabetes prediction and detection [10]. Recently, AI-based systems have played an important role in the correct diagnosis of COVID-19 [11, 12].\nA branch of artificial intelligence called “ML” focuses on creating algorithms that allow computers to learn from data and make predictions. It is based on the idea that systems can automatically get better at a task over time by gaining experience and processing lots of data. Recent advances in ML technology have enabled computers to process and understand information on a par with humans. In some cases, these systems can recognize patterns and extract information with greater accuracy than trained experts. This is a significant step forward, as it demonstrates the ability of machines to process and understand complex information in new and novel ways. ML has become a powerful tool due to improvements in classical statistical modeling techniques, large amounts of data, growth in computing power, and advanced algorithm design [13]. ML algorithms can be trained on large datasets of medical images such as radiographs and MRI scans [14], to identify signs of disease or abnormalities. There are two types of problems in ML, classification and regression. Classification is predicting an outcome from a set of data, while regression is showing the relationship between dependent and independent variables.\nWhile ML algorithms have been proven to be valuable tools in medical diagnosis [15, 16], it is essential to recognize that they should not replace human expertise and judgment. ML algorithms rely on the data they have been trained on and may not consider all relevant factors in the diagnostic process. Additionally, these algorithms are not infallible and can make errors. Therefore, it is crucial for healthcare professionals to exercise caution, review, and verify the results generated by ML systems to ensure accurate and reliable diagnoses. The integration of ML into healthcare can be considered as a collaborative approach that combines the strengths of both algorithms and human expertise to achieve the best possible outcomes for patients.\n1.1 Motivation\nThe main purpose of this thorough review is to provide a helpful guide for upcoming researchers, especially those who want to explore the unused possibilities of using ML for detecting diseases at an early stage.

Each of these diseases has been chosen with utmost consideration, reflecting their profound impact on humanity. Cancer, an enigmatic adversary with countless faces, strikes fear into hearts and calls for innovative diagnostic solutions. The unprecedented global turmoil wrought by COVID-19 emphasized the urgent need for rapid and accurate diagnostic tools. The stealthy yet devastating kidney disease, the relentless assault of heart disease, and the silent metabolic imbalance of diabetes underline the critical necessity of early detection. By delving into these human dangers, the review seeks to underscore the rationale for their selection and the urgency of pioneering ML-based diagnostic interventions.\nThirdly, the review will delve into the realm of ML algorithms that are being actively employed in the realm of smart medical applications for disease diagnosis.

Section 4 discusses the diagnosis of different diseases using ML algorithms. Section 5 presents the details of the publicly available datasets. Section 6 presents research challenges and future perspectives. Section 6 discusses the conclusions of this review.\n2 Background\n2.1 Types of ML\nDiverse categories of ML models exist, encompassing supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning approaches.\nSupervised Learning\nIn this approach, the model is trained on labeled data and makes predictions based on that data. The objective is to establish a mapping function between input and output variables. Supervised learning is commonly used for tasks like image classification, where the model learns from labeled examples to classify new images accurately.\nUnsupervised Learning\nThis category of learning entails training the model using unlabeled data, allowing it to uncover concealed patterns and structures autonomously, devoid of human intervention. Unsupervised learning excels at tasks such as image recognition and clustering, where the model identifies similarities and differences within the data without any prior knowledge of the classes or labels.\nSemi-Supervised Learning\nIn this context, the model undergoes training through a blend of both labeled and unlabeled data sources. The labeled data is used to make predictions, while the unlabeled data aids in enhancing the model’s accuracy and performance. The objective is to harness the wealth of unlabeled data in order to enhance the model’s overall performance, particularly in situations where acquiring labeled data proves expensive or time-intensive.\nReinforcement Learning\nIn the realm of reinforcement learning, an agent acquires knowledge through iterative trial and error engagements with its surroundings. By taking actions and receiving subsequent rewards or penalties contingent on its actions, the agent adapts its decision-making approach to optimize the cumulative reward signal. Reinforcement learning finds applications in various domains, such as robotics, gaming AI, and recommendation systems.\nFigure 1 illustrates the different methods of ML algorithms, depicting the relationships and distinctions among supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning approaches.\n2.1.1 Support Vector Machine (SVM)\nSVM is a ML algorithm used for classification tasks. SVM was introduced in the 20th century by Vanpik [17]. The primary objective of SVM is to identify an optimal hyperplane that effectively divides the gathered data into distinct classes. The space between this hyperplane and the nearest data points from each class is referred to as the support vector. The selection of the hyperplane aims to maximize the margin, denoting the gap between the vector and the hyperplane itself. SVM handles nonlinearly separable data. It transforms the data into a high-dimensional space where linear boundaries can be found.\n2.1.2 Decision Tree (DT)\nA DT is a supervised learning model employed to address both classification and regression tasks. DT follows the divide-and-conquer strategy [18]. DT works by dividing the source data into subsets based on the most significant attributes. This splitting is done in a recursive manner, hence it is called recursive partitioning. Each internal node is characterized as a dataset, with branches representing the decision made and leaves representing the final result or prediction. Decision Trees are popular for modeling and visualizing complex decision-making processes because they are easily interpretable and can handle both categorical and numerical data.\n2.1.3 Naïve Bayes\nNaïve Bayes [19] is a probabilistic ML algorithm that is based on the Bayes theorem. This theorem states that which states that the probability of a hypothesis (e.g., a class label in classification) given observed evidence (e.g., features of an instance) is proportional to the prior probability of the hypothesis and the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.\nThe NB algorithm is used to predict the class label of an instance based on its feature. This model makes a strong assumption of independence between features, which is why it is called naive. This independence assumption doesn’t hold in reality. This algorithm works well when there is high dimensionality and a large amount of data to classify.\n2.1.4 AdaBoost\nAdaBoost, short for Adaptive Boosting, stands as a widely recognized ensemble learning algorithm in ML. It orchestrates the amalgamation of multiple weak models, culminating in the construction of a robust model that contributes to precise predictions. This algorithm gives more weight to the samples that are harder to classify so that the model focuses more on those samples. This process is repeated several times and the weights are updated at each iteration until a satisfactory model is obtained. The final model is a weighted average of the individual weak models [20].\n2.1.5 K-nearest neighbor\nKNN is an ML classification algorithm that assigns a label to a data point based on the majority vote of the K nearest neighbors used for prediction. The algorithm identifies K data points within the training set that exhibit the closest proximity to the new data point. Subsequently, it leverages the class labels of these K neighbors to formulate a prediction. This prediction is determined through a majority vote among the classes of these K neighbors. It is important to choose an appropriate value of K because K has a significant impact on the performance of the algorithm [21].\n2.1.6 Logistic Regression\nLogistic Regression (LR) serves as a statistical model within ML, elucidating the association between a continuous dependent variable and independent variables. The independent variables, often referred to as predictors or features, play the role of prognosticators in anticipating the outcome. LR is used for 2-class classification. It first calculates the linear combination between the independent variables and the coefficient, known as the logit. It then predicts the outcome by transforming the output through a logistic/sigmoid function [22].\n2.2 Deep Learning Overview\nDeep learning (DL) represents a remarkable branch of AI and ML that has garnered significant attention due to its ability to mimic the structure and function of the human brain [23]. It has been demonstrated extraordinary potential in various applications, particularly in fields such as medical disease prediction, computer vision, and decision-making. DL algorithms, built on the concept of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), have proven to be highly effective at learning complex relationships within data and making accurate predictions. The foundation of DL lies in neural networks, which consist of interconnected processing nodes arranged in layers. Each node, or neuron, processes input data and passes the result to subsequent layers, eventually leading to the generation of an output. These networks excel at learning intricate patterns from raw data, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering, a process that traditionally required domain expertise and considerable effort [24]. The process of training DL networks is central to their success. It involves presenting the network with vast amounts of labeled data and adjusting its internal parameters, namely the weights and biases, to minimize prediction errors. This optimization process is typically achieved through gradient descent and backpropagation algorithms, which iteratively fine-tune the model’s parameters until it becomes capable of accurate predictions.\nOne of the most significant breakthroughs facilitated by DL is in the field of medical diagnosis, particularly in medical image processing. By leveraging DL models, researchers and healthcare professionals have made significant strides in diagnosing various medical conditions using different medical imaging modalities, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and chest radiographs [25,26,27,28]. These models have showcased unprecedented accuracy, often outperforming human experts. Despite these accomplishments, DL models in medical diagnosis are still in their early stages and have their limitations. While they excel at accuracy, their interpretability remains a challenge. Understanding the decision-making process of complex neural networks can be elusive, leading to concerns about the transparency and trustworthiness of their results. As such, extensive testing and validation are necessary before these models can be widely integrated into clinical practice. It is essential to interpret their outputs in conjunction with a patient’s medical history and other diagnostic information to ensure precise and reliable diagnoses.\nAs illustrated in Fig. 2, the development of ML and DL has evolved over time, with DL emerging as a powerful extension of ML. The timeline depicts the progress made in both fields, showcasing how DL has transformed various domains and opened up new possibilities for researchers, developers, and practitioners alike. In conclusion, DL stands as a revolutionary advancement in AI and ML. Through its utilization of neural networks and the ability to automatically extract complex patterns from data, DL has enabled breakthroughs in numerous AI applications. In the medical field, DL has shown promise in diagnosing diseases through medical image processing, revolutionizing healthcare practices. However, challenges related to model interpretability and rigorous validation remain critical areas of focus. As researchers continue to explore and refine DL techniques, its impact on AI and diverse industries will undoubtedly continue to be profound, fueling innovation and driving future advancements.\n2.2.1 Convolutional Neural Networks\nCNNs represent a category of powerful DL models, mainly employed for tasks in computer vision. Their applications encompass a wide range of tasks, including image classification and segmentation [29]. They are specifically designed to process visual data efficiently by exploiting the spatial correlations present in images [30]. A typical CNN consists of multiple layers. The first layer is the input layer, which takes the raw image data as input. Then, a series of convolutional layers follow. In each convolutional layer, the model utilizes a collection of tunable filters, also referred to as kernels, to process the input image, producing feature maps that highlight different patterns or features [31]. Pooling layers are frequently interspersed between convolutional layers to perform downsampling on the feature maps, effectively reducing their spatial dimensions while preserving critical information. This downsampling process not only alleviates the computational load but also enhances the network’s resilience to input variations, making it more robust in handling diverse visual patterns [32]. The outcomes obtained from these layers are commonly flattened and then fed into one or multiple fully connected layers. These fully connected layers process the high-level features and make the final predictions, depending on the specific task.\nTo introduce non-linearity, activation functions are applied after each layer’s output. The widely adopted activation function in CNNs is the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) due to its straightforwardness and its ability to address the vanishing gradient issue effectively. By setting all negative values to zero, ReLU allows the network to efficiently learn intricate representations [33, 34].\nCNNs are typically trained using various loss functions, depending on the task. For image classification, the softmax function combined with the categorical cross-entropy loss is commonly used to measure the dissimilarity between predicted and true class probabilities.\nIn the domain of regression tasks, it is commonplace to utilize loss functions such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE) [35]. Training CNNs involves forward and backward passes through the network using an optimization algorithm like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or its variants. The goal is to minimize the chosen loss function and update the network’s parameters to improve its performance on the task.\nIn summary, CNNs are a powerful class of DL models for computer vision tasks. They consist of convolutional layers to extract relevant features, pooling layers for downsampling, fully connected layers for decision-making, and ReLU activations to introduce non-linearity. The choice of loss functions depends on the specific task, and CNNs are trained to minimize these losses through optimization algorithms. Overall, CNNs have revolutionized the field of computer vision and continue to play a vital role in various real-world applications [36]. Figure 3 illustrate the basic CNN architecture.\n2.2.2 Transfer Learning\nTransfer learning constitutes a ML approach wherein insights gained from training a model on a particular task or domain are harnessed to elevate performance on a separate yet interconnected task or domain [37]. Transfer learning offers a significant advantage by reducing the necessity for a large amount of labeled data to achieve satisfactory performance on the target task [38, 39]. Pre-training on a large and diverse dataset allows the model to learn general features that are transferable to a wide range of tasks. As a result, when the model is fine-tuned on the target task with a smaller dataset, it can adapt its learned representations to the specific nuances of the new data, leading to improved performance. Transfer learning also enables the application of DL to tasks with limited data availability. Training deep neural networks from scratch typically requires a large dataset to prevent overfitting, but in many real-world scenarios, collecting such vast amounts of data might be challenging or expensive. By utilizing pre-trained models, which have already learned useful features, transfer learning allows us to tackle tasks with limited labeled data effectively.\nAnother advantage of transfer learning is that it can help mitigate the problem of vanishing gradients. Deep neural networks often have numerous layers, and during training, gradients can become very small, making it difficult for the model to learn effectively. Pre-training on a related task helps in initializing the model’s weights in a way that provides a better starting point for the optimization process during fine-tuning, making training more stable and efficient. Furthermore, transfer learning allows the application of knowledge learned from one domain to another, leading to better generalization. For example, features learned from natural image datasets can be transferred to medical imaging tasks or satellite imagery analysis, even though the source and target domains are quite different. This transfer of knowledge helps in building more robust and versatile models that perform well in various scenarios [40, 41]. Its advantages include the reduction of data requirements, the ability to handle limited labeled data, better initialization for training, and improved generalization across different domains, making it a crucial tool for advancing artificial intelligence applications.\n2.2.3 Emerging Trends in CNNs\nPre-trained models have emerged as a game-changer in the field of AI, especially for computer vision tasks. The idea behind these models is to pre-train a neural network on a large and diverse dataset, such as ImageNet, which contains millions of images belonging to thousands of different categories. During pre-training, the model learns to extract and encode meaningful features from the data, effectively capturing a general understanding of visual patterns and structures. The advantages of pre-training are manifold. Firstly, it significantly reduces the need for massive labeled datasets when tackling new tasks. Moreover, pre-trained models act as knowledge repositories that encapsulate valuable information about the low-level and high-level features found in the training data. As a result, they offer a head start for new tasks, especially in domains where gathering labeled data can be expensive, time-consuming, or simply impractical. Additionally, pre-trained models foster better generalization. The features learned during pre-training tend to be more robust and transferable across different datasets and domains. This transfer of knowledge leads to models that exhibit improved performance, particularly when the target task’s dataset is small or dissimilar from the original training data.\nThese pre-trained architectures, such as AlexNet, VGG, InceptionV3, ResNet, DenseNet, InceptionResNetV2, Xception, and MobileNet, have become standard tools in the DL toolkit. Researchers and practitioners commonly use them as the starting point for their specific computer vision projects, saving substantial computational resources and time that would otherwise be spent on training from scratch.\n-\nAlexNet: Introduced in 2012 [38], AlexNet is one of the pioneering deep CNN. It plays a significant role in popularizing DL for computer vision tasks. AlexNet is characterized by its architecture, which comprises five convolutional layers, all using ReLU activations. This arrangement results in a deeper network compared to earlier architectures, contributing to its ability to learn more intricate features and patterns from input data.\n-\nVGG (Visual Geometry Group): VGG [42] is a deep architecture proposed by the Visual Geometry Group. It is known for its simplicity and uniformity, consisting of multiple layers with small 3 × 3 convolutional filters and max-pooling layers. VGG variants with different depths, such as VGG16 and VGG19, are widely used.\n-\nInceptionV3: Also known as GoogLeNet, InceptionV3 [43] was introduced by Google researchers. It features the Inception module, which uses multiple filter sizes within the same layer to capture different-scale features. This architecture is efficient and has excellent performance on various tasks.\n-\nResNet (Residual Network): ResNet [44] is famous for introducing residual connections, which allow the model to skip some layers during training. This innovation addresses the vanishing gradient problem and made it possible to train much deeper networks. ResNet50 and ResNet101 are common variants.\n-\nDenseNet: DenseNet [45] is designed to maximize feature reuse by connecting each layer to every subsequent layer in a feed-forward fashion. This densely connected architecture fosters better gradient flow, reduces the network complexity, and encourages feature propagation throughout the network.\n-\nInceptionResNetV2: Combining ideas from both Inception and ResNet, InceptionResNetV2 [46] achieves strong performance while being computationally efficient. It incorporates residual connections and inception modules, offering a potent combination of features.\n-\nXception (Extreme Inception): Xception represents a development of the Inception architecture and introduces depthwise separable convolutions [47]. These separable convolutions in Xception are designed to dramatically decrease the computational cost while still preserving high accuracy in the model’s predictions.\n-\nMobileNet: MobileNet is designed for mobile and embedded vision applications, emphasizing efficiency and small model size [48, 49]. It employs separable convolutions to reduce the computation complexity, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments.\nIn summary, pre-trained models have revolutionized the landscape of DL, specifically in the realm of computer vision. Their ability to transfer knowledge from extensive pre-training to new tasks with limited data has made them indispensable tools for building high-performing and resource-efficient models in various real-world applications. As DL continues to advance, pre-trained models will undoubtedly remain a crucial component in accelerating progress and making cutting-edge AI accessible to a broader audience.\n2.3 Model Evaluation Metrics\nIn this section, we explain the performance metrics of the models. Model evaluation metrics are mathematical functions used to evaluate the performance of ML models. Accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and f1 score are the most commonly used evaluation metrics. The accuracy rate is the ratio between the correctly identified samples and the total samples. Precision is defined as the ratio of true positive predictions to all positive samples. The sensitivity is used to predict the actual positive samples for each available sample. The F1 score is used to evaluate the ability of the model by combining precision and recall. FP false positives, TN true negatives, FN false negatives, and TP true positives were used to calculate the performance metrics of the model. All metrics can be calculated as follows:\n3 Bibliometric Analysis\nThe Web of science and Scopus databases were used to collect references for statistical analysis. We studied the published papers using subject area, year and journal.\n3.1 Subject Area\nWhile ML has gained significant traction in healthcare applications, there are still several areas of ML-based research that require further exploration. Figure 4 provides an overview of the ML algorithms utilized across various fields. Interestingly, the dominant fields that heavily emphasize ML methods are computer science (40%) and engineering (31.2%). This indicates the widespread adoption and focus on ML techniques in these disciplines, showcasing the potential for interdisciplinary collaboration and knowledge transfer to further advance ML-based research in healthcare and other domains.\n3.2 Publications by Year\nFigure 5 provides an insightful representation of the exponential growth in published papers utilizing ML methods for disease diagnosis since 2014. The data collection process involved searching through web of science and Scopus databases using keywords such as “ML in medical applications” and “ML-based disease diagnosis.” The graph effectively demonstrates the increasing interest and research activity in this field, highlighting the expanding body of knowledge and the significance of ML in medical research.\n3.3 Publications by Journals\nThe data collection process involved gathering papers from the most popular and reputable journals published over the span of the past eight years. The analysis revealed that PLOS ONE, Nature Scientific Reports, and IEEE Access emerged as the most productive journals in terms of the number of papers published on ML-based disease diagnosis. Figure 6 visually presents the distribution of published papers across various journals. The graph provides a quantitative comparison, allowing researchers to identify the leading journals in the field and gauge the level of activity and interest within each publication. The prominence of Expert systems with applications, multimedia tools and applications, PLOS ONE, Nature Scientific Reports, Artificial intelligence in medicine and IEEE Access can be attributed to several factors, including their wide readership, interdisciplinary focus, and commitment to open access publishing. These journals likely attract a diverse range of researchers from different domains, contributing to the growing body of literature on ML applications in disease diagnosis. The significance of this finding lies in the recognition of these key journals as valuable resources for researchers interested in ML-based disease diagnosis. Researchers can target these journals for publication, ensuring their work reaches a broad audience and contributes to the collective knowledge in the field. Overall, Fig. 5 serves as a valuable visual representation of the publication trends in ML-based disease diagnosis, shedding light on the leading journals that have contributed to the dissemination of research findings in this rapidly evolving domain.\n4 Exploring the Potential of ML in Healthcare Diagnostics\n4.1 Cancer\nIslam et al. [50] conducted a comparative analysis of five ML models using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset (WBCD) sourced from the UCI ML Database. The findings demonstrate that the ANN achieved the utmost accuracy, reaching 98.57%. Sakri et al. [51] conducted a study to assess the precision of diverse data mining algorithms for forecasting breast cancer recurrence. In this endeavor, a feature selection technique known as particle swarm optimization (PSO) was integrated into three widely recognized ML classifiers, enhancing the overall accuracy. The goal was to increase the accuracy of the prediction model. With the implementation of PSO, the authors identified four features that were best for the classification task. With PSO applied, the accuracy results for NB, Fast decision tree learner, and K-NNs improved to 81.3%, 80%, and 75%, respectively. Yue et al.

Using the PIMA Indian dataset, the model achieved a train and test prediction accuracy of 99.01% and 97.25%, respectively. When tested on the LMCH dataset, these figures increased to 99.57% and 97.33%. In [146], PCA was used for feature selection, and the median was used for missing value imputation. MLP classification approach was then used, resulting in an accuracy rate of 75.7%. Singh et al. [147] utilized a combination of Linear SVM, Radial Basis function SVM, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbor algorithms to classify data, resulting in an accuracy rate of 83.8%. In [148], the author presents a Source-Free TL (SFTL) model for referable diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening, addressing limited annotated data in medical image analysis. The SFTL model utilizes a generator and discriminator with adversarial and target reconstruction losses, alongside feature consistency loss, yielding competitive results on the APTOS 2019 dataset, outperforming other supervised models. In this study [149], A novel two-step framework is introduced for diabetic retinopathy (DR) diagnosis and disease stage screening, employing ML models. The first step involves identifying essential characteristics for precise diagnosis, and the second step selects a reliable ML classification method. Ensemble learning is employed to handle heterogeneous and unbalanced databases, yielding a robust ML model capable of recognizing different DR stages with high accuracy, F1-score, precision, specificity, sensitivity, and AUC. Comparisons with other ML models are also presented by the author. The study presents an automated diagnostic method [150] for early-stage Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) diagnosis using retinal fundus images. The approach utilizes the KMA-optimized ABiLSTM technique, successfully detecting and classifying DR irregularities. Comparative evaluations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method with an impressive result and reduced computation time (50 s), offering a promising solution for DR staging challenges. In this study [151], an automated DR detection and classification method is proposed, utilizing U-Net and DL techniques to overcome limitations of traditional hand-crafted feature extraction methods. The methodology follows a two-stage approach. Image processing techniques are applied to address the low percentage of positive cases in OD and BV detection, enhancing image quantity and quality. The proposed methodology efficiently detects diabetic retinopathy (DR) using retinal biomarkers (MA, HM, and EX) with high accuracies: 97.92% on EyePACS-1, 94.59% on Messidor-2, and 93.52% on DIARETDB0 datasets. In this study [152], the authors aim to address diabetic retinopathy (DR) by proposing a novel modified GC deep belief network utilizing the dwarf mongoose optimization algorithm for effective DR prediction and classification. The approach achieves an impressive 97% accuracy in classifying fundus retinal images into normal and abnormal categories, demonstrating its efficacy on the ODIR-2019 dataset. Timely DR identification is vital to prevent complete blindness caused by retinal damage. This paper introduces a novel contribution [153] to radiomics, applying computer vision techniques to (OCT, OCTA) images for DR diagnosis. ML classifiers demonstrate effective identification of patients. The addition of clinical variables enhances accuracy, showcasing radiomics-based ML techniques’ potential for diabetic retinopathy screening in type 1 DM patients. The paper conducts an extensive investigation of DR grading protocols and taxonomy [154], identifies relevant DL-related keywords, and formulates a search string with “AND” or “OR” Boolean operators. DL algorithms and methods for DR classification are analyzed and compared, considering publicly available datasets for empirical understanding. Commonly used algorithms for DR classification are identified in this study. This study [155] assesses ML prediction models’ effectiveness in detecting VTDR in type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) patients using medical data from a data warehouse. ML approaches are utilized to create VTDR prediction models achieving strong F1 scores up to 0.81, 0.70, and 0.66 on the test set, enabling accurate VTDR forecasting over ten years. The proposed models facilitate timely referral of high-risk subjects to ophthalmologists from primary care, aiding in early diagnosis and effective management of diabetic retinopathy, reducing the risk of vision loss in type 2 DM patients. In [156], the authors propose a novel approach for diabetic retinopathy classification using OCTA vascular density maps and SVM classifier optimized by a genetic evolutionary algorithm. The SVM model achieves 90% accuracy in distinguishing between PDR and NPDR based on OCTA vascular density maps of DCP, indicating the potential of this method for accurate diagnosis and classification of diabetic retinopathy patients. This study opens new avenues for future research in this field. The paper presents a novel DCNN [157] tailored for DR prediction in retinal fundus images, incorporating correlations between long-range patches (LRP) in the DL framework. This approach significantly enhances DR detection by improving local patch features, crucial for identifying DR lesions, and the residual structure allows easy integration into other networks. The suggested method outperforms existing models on the Messidor and EyePACS datasets, emphasizing the importance of considering both local and long-range global dependencies for effective DR detection in retinal fundus images.

[158] used DCNN to diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia with the goal of maximizing accuracy. The study proposed the use of the Inception V3 model with transfer learning and achieved a validation accuracy of 93%. In another study, Sohaib et al. [159] propose a DL-based system for COVID-19 detection. They evaluate the performance of several pre-trained DL models and propose a CNN architecture for the reliable classification of X-ray images. The data used in the study consists of 2,541 X-ray images from COVID-positive and healthy patients. They achieved highest accuracy rate of 99.68%. This study [160] aimed to classify lung CT images for early diagnosis of Covid-19 using DL techniques. A CNN was implemented on a dataset comprising 1,396 lung CT images, consisting of 386 instances related to Covid-19 and 1,010 instances representing non-Covid-19 cases. The attained outcomes were subsequently compared with the results produced by conventional methods. Sara et al. [161] conducted a comparative analysis of prominent DL frameworks with the aim of automating COVID-19 classification via chest X-ray and CT images. A selection of Deep CNN was made, and the derived features were supplied to diverse ML classifiers for the classification task. Notably, the most favorable performance was observed when utilizing the DenseNet121 feature extractor in conjunction with the Bagging tree classifier, yielding a remarkable accuracy of 99%. Barstugan et al. [162] proposed a ML approach for COVID-19 classification based on CT images. They used 150 CT images and extracted patches with different sizes. They used various hand-crafted features such as GLCM, LDP, GLRLM, GLSZM, and DWT, and fed the extracted features into SVM classifier. The study used different cross-validations and found that the best accuracy of 98.77% was achieved by using the GLSZM feature extractor with 10-fold cross-validation. This paper [163] presents a method for early diagnosis of COVID-19 using X-ray images with the help of DL pre-trained models. The best model was determined by considering different model hyper parameters. The evaluation of the models was conducted using publicly accessible chest X-ray images, revealing that the most favorable outcomes were achieved by the ResNet-34 model, achieving an impressive accuracy of 98.33%. Wang and Wong [164] introduced a CNN model named COVID-Net, designed for the detection of COVID-19. The achieved testing accuracy of the model was notably high at 92.6%. In this study [165], chest X-ray scans captured in the Posterior-Anterior (PA) view were subjected to analysis using DL-based models. This investigation encompassed both COVID-19 positive and healthy patients. The dataset underwent preprocessing and augmentation, followed by a comparative assessment of three distinct models in terms of accuracy. Remarkably, the Xception model demonstrated the most superior performance, achieving an impressive accuracy of 97.97% in detecting chest X-ray images. In [166], the author introduced the LW-CORONet model, meticulously engineered to extract meaningful features from chest X-ray (CXR) images. A rigorous evaluation was conducted utilizing two extensive CXR datasets, yielding classification accuracies of 98.67% and 99.00% for multi-class scenarios, and 95.67% and 96.25% for binary classification cases, respectively. Comparative analysis was undertaken against four pre-trained CNN models and state-of-the-art counterparts. Importantly, the LW-CORONet model demonstrates a pronounced advantage by demanding fewer parameters and consuming less memory space compared to alternative models. The D3SENet [167] is a novel hybrid deep feature extraction network proposed to extract the most important features from chest x-ray images. A large and balanced dataset was used to classify Covid-19 infected, viral pneumonia infected and healthy individuals. The proposed method had an impressive result, achieving an accuracy of 98.48% on a three-class classification task. Weihan et al. [168] performed experiments on a dataset of 5143 X-ray images of three different classes (Healthy, Covid-19, and Pneumonia) using both SVM and CNN. Using handcrafted features such as Texture, GLCM, GLDM, FFT, Wavelet Transform and LBP, an SVM classifier was able to achieve an accuracy of 96.3%. When using an end-to-end CNN model, an accuracy of 98.3% was reached. The paper [169] provides a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, encompassing structural features, antigen design methods, and scalability. It discusses challenges and future prospects for preventive mRNA vaccines against infectious diseases, aiming to enhance understanding and their potential in epidemic control and public health protection. In [170], emphasizes the need for long-term follow-up studies to examine respiratory symptoms and lung damage in COVID-19 survivors. It underscores the significance of post-acute COVID-19 syndrome as a potential concern for healthcare providers, necessitating comprehensive management of chronic complications in the growing population of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals globally. In [171], the investigation focuses on assessing the effectiveness of a COVID-19 booster dose vaccination in countering the Omicron variant. The study aims to clarify the ongoing debate on the importance of booster doses and their protective duration against the Omicron variant. Utilizing PubMed (Medline) for systematic search, the paper presents findings from various studies, indicating that a booster dose can increase neutralization titers against the Omicron variant and lower the risk of symptomatic breakthrough infections. In the study [172], non-invasive medical imaging is proposed to overcome RT-PCR limitations in COVID-19 diagnosis. Deep TL-based CNN approaches are evaluated to effectively analyze chest CT images, achieving improved COVID-19 screening with custom pre-trained models using batch normalization and regularization to address overfitting and enhance detection accuracy. The proposed DQ-NNPP method [173] combines two techniques with Privacy Preservation, offering improved data transmission security with reduced encryption and decryption time. By integrating cryptographic and biometric systems with DL techniques, it achieves authentication, anomaly detection, and enhanced medical system security. Comparative analysis with standard approaches, such as SAB-UAS, MSCryptoNet, and PPDP, demonstrates its effectiveness. This paper introduces a novel ensemble method [174] for the detection of COVID-19 infection from lung CT scan images. The method involves fine-tuning multiple deep neural networks. By integrating the trained models, a robust ensemble classifier is constructed, outperforming existing methods and achieving superior outcomes. In [175], the proposed method is an ensemble approach, ET-NET, for rapid COVID-19 screening using three TL models to enhance supervised image classification performance. ET-NET combines base classifiers based on confidence scores, reducing prediction errors’ variability and achieving superior results compared to the current technique on the same dataset by 1.56% through 5-fold cross-validation. The research [176] evaluates TL-based ResNet models for COVID-19 Pneumonia detection in Chest X-ray images, emphasizing the importance of CT/CXR in identifying COVID-19 infection. The study shows performance improvements in diverse target domains, attributing the success of TL. ResNet32, with a top-2 smooth loss function and cost-sensitive features, is employed as their DTL model to handle noisy and unbalanced data. Introduces [177] a novel weights-only transfer learning (TL) technique for automatic COVID-19 infection detection in CT-scan images on point-of-care devices. This approach prunes less important filters from convolutional layers, reducing pre-trained model weight parameters. Evaluation with the SARS-CoV-2 dataset confirms its effectiveness in reducing runtime resource requirements, making it suitable for point-of-care device implementation. In [178], The author suggests a transfer learning (TL) technique involving the fine-tuning of the ResNet50 model to classify COVID-19 patients. Ten pre-trained weights from diverse datasets are used, employing supervised and self-supervised learning. The COVID-19 Radiography Database is used for training and testing, with data transformation applied and the dataset split into train and test sets. The best-performing model among various fine-tuned ResNet50 TL models is identified, achieving binary classification for Covid and Normal categories. Table 8 Explore the latest developments in COVID-19 diagnosis and detection using DL techniques, highlighting the advantages and contributions of each method towards accurate and efficient screening.\n5 Publicly Available Datasets\nData is the backbone of ML and DL models, and its availability is critical for training effective and accurate algorithms.

Introduction\nBackground the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has brought revolutionary changes in major healthcare sectors, with improved tools and innovative ways for diagnosis and patient management. AI has shown a lot of promise in the field of neurology in the present day as regards both complex neurological disorder diagnosis and treatment. For instance, healthcare providers are tremendously challenged by neurological disorders due to stroke, traumatic brain injuries, epilepsy, among other acute situations, because of their complex nature and timely intervention needed in these cases. This is even more critical in emergent cases, where rapid and accurate diagnosis is needed for the right intervention on a patient. The application of AI in neurology is an extrapolation of successes made in other general areas of medicine, where large datasets have been analyzed by machine learning algorithms, neural networks, and other AI technologies to help predict outcomes and guide clinical decision-making. AI’s ability to process vast volumes of information quickly and accurately makes it a potent tool in the emerging diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders, where time plays a critical role (1).\nProblem Statement Although there have been enormous advancements in medical imaging, clinical protocols, and pharmacological treatments, timely diagnosis and effective treatment of emergent neurological conditions remains a herculean task. Also, traditional diagnostic methods are usually very time-consuming and require a lot of expertise, such as experience and, for the said reason, may not be easily accessed in case of an emergency (44). Similarly, complex neurological disorder treatments need to be customized for individual patients, making standard approaches less effective. AI has in it the potential to bridge these gaps with real-time diagnostic support and customizing treatment plans, based on huge datasets and predictive modeling. While this is its potential, AI is only at the very early stages of actual practice applications, such as emergent neurological cases. Current advancements are in need of comprehensive scrutiny due to the state of the field in the diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders with AI, which suggests specific places for further method development and research.\nWhile the advancements in AI for neurological care are promising, it is critical to acknowledge gaps in the current literature. Many existing reviews provide a broad overview of AI applications but fail to focus on emergent neurological situations where time-sensitive interventions are paramount. This article aims to fill that gap by reviewing the specific role of AI in diagnosing and managing acute neurological emergencies such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, and acute spinal cord injury. Moreover, prior reviews have not sufficiently discussed the ethical and practical challenges of integrating AI into real-world clinical settings, especially in low-resource environments. This comprehensive review will address these overlooked areas, providing a nuanced perspective on future research directions.\nAims the primary intention of the literature review is to assess the current state of AI-assisted diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders, with a particular focus on emergent cases. This review shall hence strive to:\nDiscuss recent developments in AI technologies relevant to emergent neurological disease diagnosis and treatment.\nEvaluate how well AI applications improve patient outcomes in the emergency setting.\nHighlight challenges and limitations in the implementation of AI in neurology.\nMake recommendations for future research and clinical practice.\nA well-structured review of this topic is essential to facilitate a clear understanding of AI’s transformative potential in neurology. This review will follow a systematic format to ensure coherence and clarity, covering recent technological developments, clinical applications, and the ethical implications of using AI in emergent neurological cases. By structuring the discussion around specific neurological emergencies, this review avoids the pitfalls of other articles that lack focus and cohesion. Additionally, we aim to highlight the limitations of current AI applications, thereby setting the stage for targeted research that can address these shortcomings in a meaningful way.\nPurpose and Usefulness As previously outlined, this literature review will cover studies published in the last 8 years that echo the most recent advances in AI and its applications in neurology. This review, therefore, looks at AI tools aiding in diagnoses, treatment planning, and management strategies for dealing with emergent cases of neurological disorders. Since there is an increased need for timely and accurate interventions in emergent cases, this review will focus on the role of AI on patient outcomes during such incidences (2).\n2. Methodology\nThis literature review was conducted to critically assess the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in the diagnosis and treatment of neurological emergencies, with a particular focus on emergent neurological conditions such as stroke, traumatic brain injury (TBI), and acute spinal cord injury. The review was structured to identify recent advancements, challenges, and future directions in AI applications within the neurology field.\n2.1. Literature search strategy\nThe literature search was performed using several academic databases, including PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Google Scholar, and Scopus, to identify peer-reviewed articles published between 2015 and 2023.

Data extraction and analysis\nRelevant data from the selected studies were extracted into a standardized table. This table included key information such as the type of AI model used (e.g., machine learning, deep learning), the neurological condition targeted, study outcomes, and the challenges or limitations identified in the study. Each article was reviewed for the AI model’s clinical utility, accuracy, speed, and the ability to integrate with traditional healthcare practices.\n2.4. Synthesis of findings\nThe findings from the reviewed studies were synthesized to identify patterns in the successful application of AI technologies in neurology. Special attention was given to AI’s role in emergent neurological conditions where timely diagnosis and intervention are critical. The review also synthesized information on the barriers to AI implementation, including ethical considerations, data privacy concerns, biases in AI models, and the integration of AI in low-resource settings. Challenges such as the “black box” nature of AI and the difficulty in clinical validation were also discussed based on the literature reviewed.\n2.5. Quality assessment\nTo ensure the robustness of the findings, each study was critically evaluated based on its methodology, sample size, and the rigor of its AI model validation. Biases and limitations of each study were documented to provide a comprehensive and balanced view of AI’s potential in neurology.\n2.6. Ethical considerations\nEthical implications were also extracted and analyzed, particularly concerning data privacy, bias in AI models, and the need for transparency and explainability in AI-driven clinical decision-making. Studies that explored the ethical dimensions of AI in healthcare were incorporated to highlight gaps and provide recommendations for future research and clinical practice.\n3. AI in healthcare: an overview\nGeneral Applications of AI in Healthcare: Artificial intelligence very much remains an integral part of the modern-day healthcare paradigm, ranging from predictive analytics to personalized medicine. Fundamentally, AI utilizes machine learning algorithms, neural networks, and natural language processing for the analysis of huge data sets to identify patterns and make predictions. AI, thus empowered, has helped improve the very core elements of healthcare: diagnosis, treatments, planning, drug discovery, and patient management.\nA good application for this is diagnostic imaging, in which AI algorithms are being trained to analyze medical images like X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans with high accuracy. The studies have shown that AI systems could be comparable or even better than human experts when finding medical image abnormalities, thus making correct and faster diagnoses (3). For instance, in oncology cases where AI was applied in the detection of cancerous lesions on radiological images, a lot of time gets saved during detection, with a result of better patient outcomes (4).\nBesides imaging, AI is also applicable in predictive analytics for the identification of patients at risk of developing some diseases. Artificial intelligence using electronic health records and other clinical data provides a predictive way of the probability of an occurrence of a disease, hence enabling intervention measures to be instituted even for preventive purposes (5). This is of great use in the prognosis of chronic illnesses such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, whereby complications and adverse effects are prevented in order to reduce healthcare expenses.\n3.1. AI in neurology\nThe field of neurology has advanced greatly through the application of AI to combat the complexities associated with neurological disorders. Symptoms of neurological conditions are generally hard to quantify and follow by traditional techniques, and this is the key argument by proponents of AI such as Rao et al. (6). With its ability to handle huge amounts of data and detect subtle patterns, AI offers a totally new approach toward these diseases.\nThe application of AI in neurology is best illustrated in diagnostic imaging. The brain images are subjected to analysis of late by use of techniques that include deep learning, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to detect and diagnose the symptoms of any upcoming potential neurological disorder. For example, AI algorithms used to find early signs of Alzheimer’s disease by studying the structure and functional MRI scans can detect those even before the clinical symptoms start to manifest in patients (7). This helps in early detection, which could play a very important role in slowing the advance of the disease and improving the quality of life for such patients.\nBesides imaging, the application of AI is seen in the analysis of EEGs for various epileptic seizure disorders and other such disorders. An analysis of an EEG by conventional procedures is both time-consuming and needs expert interpretation. AI-based systems can automate the procedure and thereby result in a quick and at-the-same-time accurate diagnosis (8). This is particularly relevant in the emergent cases of neurology, where timely diagnosis can go a long way in determining outcome post-therapy.\nEmerging Technologies in AI-Assisted Neurology: Currently, several emerging technologies are underway and will shape AI research in neurology with the potential to revolutionize diagnosis and treatment. For example, one of these technologies would be deep learning, a distinctive way of modeling complicated patterns within the data. In recent years, deep learning algorithms have been utilized to comprehend various neurological conditions’ disease mechanisms and possible therapeutic targets, which seemed to increase in relevance considerably recently (9).\nReinforcement learning, a subfield of machine learning, is another promising technology where algorithms learn through the environment they interact with to make decisions. In neurology, reinforcement learning has been applied in the development of neurorehabilitation systems during interaction with patients—a characteristic AI device that caters to changes in progression, offering personalized therapy options (10).\nIn addition, NLP is increasingly being applied in neurology for the purposes of the analysis of patient records and clinical notes. Valuable information, especially on symptoms, treatment responses, and disease progression, present in free text, can be obtained from the application of NLP algorithms in regard to a patient’s condition (11).\n3.2. AI in emergent neurological cases\nEmergent neurological cases, such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, and acute spinal cord injury, demand timely management. AI has proved its potential in such cases by giving rapid diagnostic support and aiding at critical junctures of decision-making (12). For example, AI algorithms were created in stroke cases to analyze imaging data and identify patients who would benefit from thrombolysis or thrombectomy; this vastly reduced the time required for treatment and resulted in better outcomes.\nThe use of AI systems to predict outcomes and guide decisions on treatment with data from the patient, including imaging, vital signs, and clinical history, is tremendous. Such AI-enabled insights would aid clinicians in making prioritized interventions and better allocate resources in settings with constrained resources.\n3.3. Limitations of AI in neurological emergencies\nWhile the potential for AI in neurology, particularly in emergent situations, is well-documented, the technology is not without limitations. One major challenge is the “black box” nature of many AI algorithms, especially those based on deep learning models. These models can generate accurate predictions, but their inner workings are often opaque to clinicians, leading to concerns about the interpretability of AI-assisted diagnoses and treatments (13). This lack of transparency can hinder trust and adoption in clinical settings, as healthcare providers may be hesitant to rely on systems they do not fully understand.\nMoreover, AI algorithms are only as good as the data they are trained on. Bias in AI systems is a well-recognized issue, particularly in healthcare, where training data may not adequately represent diverse patient populations. For example, AI systems trained predominantly on data from Western populations may not perform as well for patients from different ethnic backgrounds, potentially leading to misdiagnoses or suboptimal care (14). This raises ethical concerns, especially in high-stakes emergent cases where AI recommendations could significantly influence patient outcomes.\nFurthermore, the clinical validation of AI tools in real-world settings remains a significant hurdle. Many AI systems have shown promising results in controlled research environments but have yet to be thoroughly tested in everyday clinical practice, particularly in low-resource settings. The transferability of these technologies to varied healthcare environments is still questionable, as resource limitations may affect the deployment and reliability of AI systems (15). These limitations underscore the need for more comprehensive and transparent AI systems that can be trusted by clinicians and patients alike.\n4. Computer-aided diagnosis of neurological disorders\n4.1. AI in diagnostic imaging\nOne of the most important fields in which AI has contributed much to Neurology is Diagnostic Imaging. Traditional imaging techniques—beans, CT scans, and PET scans—are basically diagnostic pieces of equipment for neurological disorders. Still, their interpretation may be pretty subjective and time-consuming, needing highly specialized radiologists. AI has emerged as a power tool in the realm of imaging analysis, especially for improving accuracy and efficiency through deep learning algorithms.\nEven though the recent research evidence has been able to illustrate that AI can be applied in neurological conditions diagnosis using imaging, the history of artificial intelligence implementation dates back to over three decades ago. For instance, CNNs were designedly trained for the detecting early signs of Alzheimer’s disease by reviewing structural MRI scans. The AI systems showed an accuracy close to that of expert radiologists with faster processing times added as an advantage (4). Early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease is important for timely institution of intervention measures that might retard the process.\nAI has already been used in providing great promise to assist in a rapid diagnosis concerning emergent neurology cases, such as acute ischemic stroke. Stroke is a significant cause of worldwide disability and death with a narrow window for effective treatment. Algorithms have been developed that are AI-driven for image analysis in CT and MRI, which one can leverage quickly to capture stroke type and occluded blood vessels and assess the extent of damage in the brain. Diagnostic tools like these, powered by AI-driven innovation, would increasingly help reduce time to treatment, a critical determinant of patient outcome (16).\n4.2. AI in EEG analysis\nElectroencephalography is another vital tool in establishing the diagnosis of neurological disorders, more especially in epilepsy. Traditionally, the analysis of EEG data used to take a lot of time since it required manual interpretation by neurologists. AI has revolutionized EEG analysis with automatization of detecting abnormal brain wave activity associated with seizures and other neurological conditions.\nDeep learning models, particularly recurrent neural networks and long short-term memory networks, have been applied to EEG data in epileptic seizure prediction with a high degree of accuracy. The models are capable of going through a large data set from EEG recordings to come up with a pattern indicating seizure events that may not be observable by human eyes at any immediate instance. This is particularly useful in view of emergency situations where the time factor is pretty crucial for diagnosis and intervention.\nNevertheless, application of AI to seizure prediction has opened a window for preventive interventions. According to some studies, AI models trained with EEG data predict seizures minutes or even hours in advance, thus offering sufficiently large benefits for epilepsy management.\n4.3. AI in the diagnosis of traumatic brain injury (TBI)\nTBI is one of those critically important conditions that require immediate attention and treatment to prevent long-term neurological damage or even death. Diagnosis in cases of TBI mostly involves the use of imaging techniques, particularly CT, to determine the extent of injury to the brain. Traditional imaging techniques have usually failed in detecting subtle changes to brain structure and function following TBI due to its subtle nature of alterations.\nMore recently, AI has been, this way, applied to support the diagnosis of TBI via analysis of imaging data, with clinical variables down the line. Machine learning models have been constructed to better predict the outcomes for TBI patients from CT scan data, vital signs, and others like clinical indicators. AI-driven predictions could input into critical decisions about appropriateness related to the urgency of intervention, the need for ICU care, and potential for recovery (17).\nAI applications in neuropsychological assessments used for the diagnosis of TBI have also been applied alongside imaging. For example, the speech and language patterns of TBI patients were examined to glean insights into such cognitive impairments that lie hidden in imaging alone using NLP algorithms. It is then that this kind of multi-modal approach to diagnosis, combining imaging, clinical data, and neuropsychological assessment, held great promise in management with regard to TBI.\n4.4. Case studies and applications to real life\nSeveral case studies and real-world applications have attested to the effectiveness of AI in diagnose neurological disorders. For example, McKinney et al. (18) conducted a study that revealed the use of AI in the diagnosis of an acute stroke in a large clinical setting. It reported an AI system that could identify stroke on computed tomography scanner images virtually as well as expert radiologists do—yet significantly eased diagnosis time. This time-to-diagnosis reduction is incisive in emergent cases where every minute counts.\nAnother very good example is the application of AI in Parkinson’s disease diagnosis. AI models are trained using MRI and PET scans to detect the first manifestations of Parkinson’s, often before motor symptoms start to set in. Early diagnosis instituting treatments that slow down the progression of the disease drives better patient outcomes.\nAI has been successfully applied to epilepsy care in recent times, in relation to patient monitoring and seizure prediction. For instance, Kuhlmann et al. (19) presented an example where AI was applied in predicting seizures for patients with refractory epilepsy. The system supplied proper predictions of seizure episodes, facilitating interventions on time and thus reducing the frequency of seizures.\nCase examples in the next sections demonstrate the potential for AI to greatly affect a sea-change in neurological disorder diagnosis. As the development of AI progresses, so will the applications move into neurology, opening more opportunities in routine and emergent cases for early and accurate diagnoses.\n5. AI in treatment and management of neurological disorders\n5.1. AI-guided treatment plans\nEspecially with neurology, where patients require personalized treatment approaches because of the nature of neurological disorders—both complicated and variable—AI in treatment planning has shown remarkable promise. Recent AI-driven systems analyze big datasets, like patient history, genetic information, and clinical biomarkers, in developing personalized treatments that fit the patients’ profile. These include state-of-the-art innovations in treatment planning for patients with epilepsy. This is considered important in such conditions as epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson’s, for the treatment response of which patients sometimes show a widely differing extent.\nHowever, AI has been used to build models informed by a lot of data obtained through clinical trials and the outcomes of real-world cases related to predicting the optimal medication dosage for patients with epilepsy in a way that minimized risks yet maximized therapeutic efficacy (20). The models use machine learning algorithms to study data obtained from analyses of clinical trials and real-world patient outcomes, hence giving out better treatment options.\nIn the field of Parkinson’s disease management, AI has been utilized in the optimization of deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapy processes. DBS is a well-known and effective treatment for Parkinson’s, but its effectiveness depends on the precision of electrode placement and the setting of parameters, which are difficult to optimize by hand. Unfortunately, the management of systems with more complex representation is not that easy and could be done manually. AI-based algorithms to analyze patient-specific information reportedly lead to optimal DBS parameters, new treatment outcomes, and improvements. A good overview of the field was discussed and summarized by Kühn and Volkmann (21).\n5.2. Surgical assistance\nNeurosurgery is one of the tough-to-handle surgical specialties and needs relatively greater precision and technique. With this regard, AI has started to implement neurosurgical procedures, aiming to deliver real-time decision support and improve the surgical outcome produced in return. AI-driven surgical robotics and navigation systems have been reported in neurological surgeries with elements of complexity, such as resection of tumors and interventions to address spinal surgery (22), in line with that.\nA significant number of applications for AI implementation in neurosurgery relate to brain tumor surgical planning and execution. Conventional surgical planning depends on the surgeon’s experience and judgment, although AI systems are capable of conducting preoperative imaging data analysis for creating 3D models, hence the neuronavigation tackle relevant to information on these models. Such showcases work to let surgeons know exactly where to make the incision so that they cause as little damage as possible to the healthy tissue around a tumor (23).\nIn this sense, an AI-powered robotic system can take part in helping the instruments get feedback during a surgery, maintaining its steadiness and offering real-time feedback to the surgeon. With this approach, it will be more accurate, will reduce the effect of human fallibility, and will allow undertakings that are less aggressive. For example, AI-supported robotic systems, such as ROSA and Mazor X, have led to increased surgical accuracy and decreased recovery times in spinal surgeries and deep brain stimulation procedures, respectively. AiBootApplication.\n5.3. Rehabilitation and long-term management\nNotably, the role of AI applies beyond acute treatment to rehabilitation and long-term management in neurological disorders. Motor and cognitive recovery in patients suffering from rehabilitation period.\nTrueAIhas helped develop the leading personal rehabilitation programs, which are based on patients’ progress. Machine learning algorithms analyze rehabilitation session data to read patterns of movement and recovery metrics, in order to make real-time adjustments to therapy protocols. For example, AI-enabled exoskeletons and robotic devices provide assistance to patients in carrying out repetitive movements involved in physical therapy, with features like real-time feedback and setting resistance according to the ability of the patient. For interventions on a more precise level, robotic devices may sometimes be incorporated into traditional physical therapy. For instance, robotic gait trainers can enable walking movements for (39).\nApart from physical rehabilitation, AI has also been incorporated into cognitive rehabilitation for patients with brain injuries and neurodegenerative diseases. Artificial intelligence-powered platforms can deliver personalized cognitive exercises for the irregularities of a specific patient, can systematically track the progress of the activities, and even modulate the difficulties during the course of the improvement tempo (24). These types of systems can find effective use in further elicitation of cognitive recovery in stroke patients and those suffering from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (25, 40).\nMore importantly, AI applications will be important in the long-term monitoring of a patient and management. For instance, wearable devices and mobile health apps with AI abilities will be useful in monitoring vital signs and patterns of movement and symptoms delivery in real time to healthcare providers (26). For instance, AI-driven apps have been useful to monitor the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease like tremors and abnormalities in the gait, allowing the remote adjustment in clinical management for patients with the disease carved out herein (27). Continuous monitoring comes very handy in chronic neurological conditions because it can help reveal the course of chronologically developing symptoms that might prevent later complications and hospitalizations (42).\n5.4. Case-based studies and real-life applications\nSeveral real-world applications highlight the transformation that the AI field is having in the treatment and management of neurological disorders. A good example is the optimization of the treatment plan for conditions such as strokes. A study by McKinney et al. (18) has also proven that the AI system can review patient information, imaging, and clinical history to give a recommendation for the best thrombolytic therapy or the best surgical operation. This AI-driven approach reduced time to treatment and improved patient outcomes in acute cases of stroke.\nRobotic systems incorporated with the help of AI in neurosurgery have shown that successfully conducted complex resections. A case report documented by Shen et al. (22) was performed on the use of an AI-driven robotic system during a resection of glioblastoma, one of the most aggressive forms of brain cancer. The robotic system is capable of providing real-time feedback before and during surgery to allow the surgeon to conduct better resection with minimed damage to neighborhood tissues for good patient outcomes.\nAI-exoskeletons have also been used for stroke patients. A study by Mehrholz et al. (28) has shown that stroke patients using AI exoskeletons for their rehabilitation had significantly better mobility and functional independence as compared to those treated with conventional therapy.\nThese are illustrative of the potential of AI in changing the very landscape of treatment and management in neurological disorders and thus give fresh hope both to the patient and the clinician.\n6. Ethical and practical concerns\n6.1. Ethical implications\nThe excessively rapid uptake of AI in neurological diagnosis and treatment raises numerous very serious ethical issues and, if not handled properly, it could tilt the scales toward responsible and fair use. One major issue of AI that comes to the focus with such a rapid uptake is bias within the algorithms. AI systems in nature are based on gigantic datasets, and lack of representation of diversified population in these datasets may be a significant problem where the developed algorithms continue their existence discretely. For example, research indicates that models of AI that are largely trained on data from certain ethnic groups are less accurate for patients from other backgrounds, with possible outcomes of misdiagnosis—and underdiagnosis—and less than optimal care (14).\nSelection of such datasets must be diverse and represent the population to avoid this issue. This also requires that there be transparency in both the development and the deployment stages of the AIs; both the clinicians and patients need to know how the decisions are being made by an AI algorithm and therefore know what limitations or bias are possible (29). Maintaining ethical AI practice also needs ongoing monitoring and validation of the AI systems to prove that they will perform equally well with all patients (41).\nAnother important ethical issue surrounding AI in healthcare is privacy and data security. The accuracies of AI systems for treating patients come from its training with very large pools of patient data that are essentially medical records, imaging data, and genetic information. Such a sensitive use of data raises concerns about its misuse and unauthorized access or potential breach with such large pools of sensitive personal health information. Privacy and security of patient data are very critical; the data should, therefore, be well protected with strong protection mechanisms to ensure that the data is secure.\nAnother critical ethical consideration is that of informed consent in using AI in healthcare. It is important that patients are properly informed on how AI systems would be used and the basis of the data to be collected and the use to which such data will be put. Correctly, patients should be given the chance not to receive AI-driven interventions if they would prefer the traditional method of care. Ensuring that patients are aware of their rights and that they have autonomy in their healthcare decisions is essential in maintaining trust in AI technologies.\nThere comes the issue of accountability and responsibility whenever AI is utilized toward care. Sure, AI systems generate enormous insights and in many instances give recommendations, but in the end, the liability associated with clinical decisions lies with human providers. Of the greatest significance is the guidance on how the recommendations made by AI should be integrated into clinical practice: the final decision regarding the treatment has to rely on the judgment of professionals and patient preferences (30).\nEthical considerations are crucial when discussing the deployment of AI in neurological emergencies. A significant concern is the transparency of AI decision-making processes, often referred to as the “black box” problem. Clinicians and patients alike may struggle to trust AI-driven recommendations without a clear understanding of how the system arrives at these conclusions. Furthermore, regulatory frameworks for AI in healthcare remain underdeveloped, making it challenging to ensure that AI systems meet the required standards of safety and efficacy. Comprehensive guidelines and strict regulatory oversight are needed to prevent misuse and ensure that AI technologies are deployed responsibly.\n6.2. Practical challenges\nLaying aside ethical concerns, some practical ones in respect to how AI can really be transformed and integrated with usable healthcare clinical practices points to problems in regard to interoperability: In this line, most of the hospitals and clinics currently in play lack proper interoperation of sophisticated AI systems and legacy systems of healthcare infrastructure. Serious efforts should be applied to establish appropriate compatibility of the advanced modern AI technologies with the popular legacy systems prevalent in most of the hospitals and clinics. Upgrading these systems to AI tool accommodation would be time and resource-consuming, which will thus represent a critical challenge in making the technologies widely accepted.\nIn addition, clinical applications will call for significant training of the healthcare workforce. Ideally, the medical workforce should be trained in the utilization of such AI tools, interpret results and integrate them for better understanding of patient care (31). That is bound to call for realignment in the medical-education framework and shift in training programs to allow for the next generation of healthcare associates to be conversant with these AI technologies.\nYet another practical challenge lies in health care AI regulation. The regulatory entities have yet established frameworks for the specific evaluation of safety and efficacy for medical devices and software driven by AI, according to Bakker et al. (32). Assurance that AI systems meet requirements can be a long and painstaking procedure; thus, critical technologies are likely to remain partners in some cases without deployment in clinical settings.\nBesides that, the implementation of AI may be very costly, enough for most healthcare institutions, especially the low-resource ones, to not afford. While AI has the potential to cut health service costs in the long term, since it is efficient and enhances health outcomes, the high magnitude of the required investment in infrastructure, training, and integration of AI services could be substantial. Rising to all the financial challenges will be crucial to realize the benefits of AI for all patients regardless of geography or economic status.\nFinally, there is the issue of acceptance. Apart from the anticipated improvement that may come from AI, any form of impact or changes in the tasks from work might be among those reasons that the healthcare professional is apprehensive of using the technology because it means dispossession of work, loss of control, and others (15). Embracing AI in neurology as a valuable tool throughout the field, and even beyond it, will be of paramount importance in building trust for these systems and showcasing their clinical validation and value throughout real-world success stories.\n6.3. Balancing innovation with responsibility\nThe practical and ethical challenges associated with AI in neurology underline the need for a balanced approach that holds concerns of innovation and responsibility with equal respect. While AI offers the potential to completely revolutionize the process of diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders, it is, at the same time, very important that development and deployment of such technologies be carried out in a fair manner that is transparent and according to the highest standards of patient care.\nThis will likely emanate from collaborative working of AI developers, healthcare providers, patients, and regulatory bodies, who might work together in order to ensure AI technologies work in a manner that supports all patients, addresses all ethical concerns, and overcomes all practical challenges. In this way, all potential ways of AI application in neurology would be fully realized, thereby offering new hope for patients with neurological disorders but at the same time maintaining the trust and confidence of the healthcare community.\n7. Broader applications of AI in neurology\nTo provide a comprehensive review of AI’s role in neurology, it is crucial to broaden the scope beyond its well-established applications, such as in stroke, Alzheimer’s disease, and epilepsy. AI technologies hold vast potential for addressing a wider range of neurological conditions, particularly those that have historically been underrepresented in the literature. Expanding research in this area would allow AI to demonstrate its versatility and impact across various complex and rare neurological disorders.\nOne of the emerging areas where AI can play a transformative role is in neurogenomics. AI has the ability to analyze large volumes of genetic data to identify patterns and genetic mutations associated with neurological conditions. For example, AI-driven tools are increasingly being used to predict disease onset and progression in disorders like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Huntington’s disease (9). By integrating neuroimaging, genetic data, and clinical biomarkers, AI can help clinicians develop personalized treatment strategies tailored to a patient’s unique genetic profile, which is particularly relevant in managing these neurodegenerative diseases where early detection is critical (7).\nIn addition, AI has shown promise in the management of movement disorders such as Parkinson’s disease. Beyond diagnostic imaging and predictive analytics, AI can be used to optimize treatment plans for patients receiving deep brain stimulation (DBS). By analyzing patient data in real time, AI systems can adjust stimulation parameters to provide more precise therapeutic outcomes (21). This capability allows for continuous, personalized care, reducing the need for frequent hospital visits and improving the quality of life for patients with chronic movement disorders.\nAnother area where AI could expand its application is in mental health and cognitive disorders. AI-driven models have been developed to assist in the diagnosis of psychiatric and cognitive disorders like depression, schizophrenia, and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (7). AI can analyze speech patterns, facial expressions, and behavioral data to detect early signs of cognitive decline, offering potential for early interventions in conditions like dementia. This approach provides clinicians with real-time insights that go beyond traditional cognitive assessments, allowing for a more dynamic and individualized understanding of patient progress.\nFurthermore, AI can be instrumental in identifying biomarkers and developing predictive models for rarer conditions, such as multiple system atrophy (MSA) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). These diseases often have overlapping symptoms with more common conditions, making early and accurate diagnosis challenging. AI algorithms trained on multimodal data—encompassing neuroimaging, clinical records, and genetic information—can help differentiate between these disorders, providing more timely and accurate diagnoses (33).\nDespite these promising developments, there is still limited research on AI’s application to these broader neurological conditions. Future research must focus on expanding AI models to cover a wider array of neurological diseases, ensuring that these technologies benefit all patients, not just those with more commonly studied disorders. Collaborative efforts between neurologists, AI researchers, and healthcare providers will be essential in developing AI systems that can be generalized across diverse neurological conditions, leading to more inclusive and equitable healthcare solutions.\n8. Comparative analysis: AI vs. traditional methods in neurological emergencies\nFor AI to truly transform the field of neurology, its applications must be critically compared to traditional diagnostic and treatment methods. While AI offers significant advantages in speed, precision, and the ability to process vast datasets, traditional methods still hold value in various clinical contexts, especially when considering the expertise of seasoned clinicians and the established reliability of manual diagnostic techniques.\nOne of the most well-recognized benefits of AI is its ability to analyze complex imaging data far more rapidly than human clinicians. For example, AI algorithms applied to CT and MRI scans in stroke cases can reduce diagnosis time from hours to minutes, a critical factor in improving patient outcomes (18). These algorithms can also detect subtle abnormalities that might be missed by human eyes, particularly in time-sensitive conditions like ischemic stroke, where quick identification of occlusions can determine whether a patient is a candidate for thrombolytic therapy (12).\nHowever, traditional methods, particularly manual interpretation of imaging data, still play an essential role, especially in cases where clinical judgment and experience are needed to contextualize findings. For instance, while AI can flag potential abnormalities, it may struggle with atypical presentations that experienced radiologists or neurologists could interpret within the broader clinical picture (3). The complexity of neurological emergencies often requires the integration of multiple diagnostic inputs, including clinical history, laboratory results, and imaging studies—areas where human clinicians excel in synthesizing information for comprehensive decision-making.\nMoreover, the robustness of AI in real-world clinical settings, particularly in low-resource environments, remains a significant concern. Traditional methods, though time-consuming, do not rely on advanced infrastructure, making them more accessible in healthcare settings with limited resources. This is a critical advantage when deploying diagnostic tools in rural or underserved areas, where AI-driven systems requiring high computational power and sophisticated hardware may not be feasible (34). In such settings, traditional methods remain the gold standard for ensuring patients receive adequate care.\nAnother area of comparison is in treatment personalization. AI-driven treatment plans, particularly for conditions like epilepsy and Parkinson’s disease, leverage vast amounts of patient data to recommend highly personalized therapies (9). However, traditional clinical decision-making, informed by years of medical experience, offers a level of intuition that AI systems currently lack. For example, while AI might suggest optimal DBS (Deep Brain Stimulation) settings for a Parkinson’s patient based on data, a neurologist’s familiarity with the patient’s nuanced responses to treatment can guide adjustments that enhance the patient’s quality of life (21).\nFinally, AI and traditional methods differ in how they handle the element of uncertainty in neurological care. AI systems rely on probabilistic models that calculate the likelihood of outcomes based on available data. While this approach offers a level of precision and objectivity, it may fall short in cases where the data is incomplete or ambiguous. On the other hand, experienced clinicians are often adept at navigating uncertainty, making judgment calls based on intuition and years of practice—an area where AI has yet to match human capability (35).\nIn conclusion, AI offers clear advantages in terms of speed and data processing but still requires integration with traditional clinical methods, particularly in complex or resource-limited settings. Future research should focus on developing hybrid models that combine AI’s computational power with the clinical expertise of human neurologists, ensuring that both tools are used in complementary ways to improve patient outcomes in neurological emergencies.\n9. Future directions and recommendations\n9.1. Emerging trends in AI-assisted neurology\nAI in neurology heralds a bright future with the lightning advances made in machine learning, data analytics, and computational power. Many emerging trends are set to shape the future of AI-assisted diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders.\nOne of these trends is in multimodal approaches from AI frameworks, which combine different realms of data—imaging, genetic information, and clinical biomarkers—toward characterizing a condition for more complete and accurate diagnoses. Such systems combined from various sources can therefore help to realize much better diagnosis accuracy and avert several misdiagnoses that might be averted in hard neurological conditions. For example, genomics data can be combined with imaging results in diseases like brain tumors and neurodegenerative diseases to give valuable evidence for precision treatment strategies (24).\nNeurogenomics represents a second most impactful emerging area that is being exposed by AI. Recent advances in the field of genomics and increasing volumes of available genetic data open up opportunities for AI discovery and corresponding targeted neurogenomic therapeutic interventions. Analysis driven by AI of these genetic data may well lead to more targeted therapy in general with respect to more accurate diagnoses of treatment—especially for serious genetically based conditions like Huntington’s disease and ALS (9).\nIn the case of another line, AI is growingly used to develop predictive models for the neurological disorder of interest. Such high-risk groups can lead, for example, to conditions such as Alzheimer’s or stroke, and early intervention and preventive therapy can be taken. Predictive analytics, with the help of AI, changes the field of neurology by switching it from a reactive to a proactive regime. It can avert the onset and reduce the progression of disease.\nAnother ray of hope is the integration of AI along with wearable devices and telemedicine platforms. Wearable devices with built-in AI models may offer continuous neuro health monitoring of patients, with the detection of initial manifestations of decline and real-time alerting to a healthcare provider. The importance of continuous monitoring cannot be overemphasized, since timely changes in treatment planning may prevent complications for such patients with chronic disorders as Parkinson’s disease or epilepsy.\n9.2. Recommendations for clinical practice\nSeveral catalyzers realize the full potential that AI can make in neurology for successful integration into clinical practice. Therefore, the following recommendations are proposed for healthcare providers along with policymakers and researchers to facilitate the adoption of AI technologies in neurology:\nInfrastructure Investment in AI: Investment in the infrastructure needed, within healthcare institutions, to support AI technologies, such as advanced computing systems, data storage solutions, and secure networks. Such an investment is important in embedding AI systems into the existing workflow in the clinics in such a manner that it is best used.\nIMPROVE QUALITY OF DATA AND DIVERSITY: AI models ought to be trained on diverse good quality data so that it can reduce bias and improve generalizability. Potential ways to ensure data are drawn from diverse patient populations, possibly including underrepresented groups, to ensure that AI systems are continuously oriented to operate equally across different subgroups, should an effort become prevalent toward these ends.\nPromoting a Collaborative Interdisciplinary Field the Development of: Developing and applying AI in neurology requires a coordinated effort of AI development professionals, neurologists, and radiologists. It needs the cooperation of geneticists and other professionals working in healthcare. Systems developed by interdisciplinary teams will link the differences between technology and clinical practice into systems that are developed holistically to account for differences in the needs and priorities of patients and clinicians (30).\nEthical and Regulatory Compliance: AI developers should, therefore, put serious first consideration on ethics and observe regulatory standards. This pits several aspects that touch on privacy and data protection, informed consent issues, and general issues of accountability when AI systems are deployed into clinical settings, as has been postulated by numerous authors (29).\nInvestment in Clinician Education and Training: Both medical education curricula and training programs should include AI-augmented activities and protocols, preparing healthcare providers in this environment. Equally essential is having the knowledge clinicians must possess for better interpretation and integration of AI-sourced insights while providing care and recognizing AI’s capabilities and limitations in the process (36).\nSupport Ongoing Research and Development: Research in the development of AI applications for neurology needs continued support in order to either optimize existing solutions or keep pace with the development of new solutions. Specifically, funding agencies and academic institutions should ensure continuous support for research work that focuses on developing new AI solutions promising to support improvements in the diagnosis, management, and treatment of neurological disorders.\n9.3. Research gaps and future studies\nDespite its tremendous potential in the field of neurology, there are still certain important research gaps that need to be addressed in future studies. Among the most crucial, though, is another call for studies to be longitudinal investigations that assess the effects of AI-driven interventions over a long period of patient outcomes. Although most of the studies indicate the short-term benefits that AI brings, knowledge about its effects for a long term is of importance in knowing the worth or value conferred in clinical practice.\nAnother research gap is the development of explainable models of AI. Whereas AI systems could provide, with a good degree of accuracy, predictions and recommendations, they often acted like “black boxes” that are hard to understand at a deep level by clinicians. Development of transparent and explainable AI models will go a long way in engendering trust among healthcare providers in AI-driven decisions and ensuring that they are well understood and actionable (13).\nIn addition, ethical implications around issues of bias, fairness, and accountability necessitate more research on applied AI to neurology. It is a necessity to find ways in which biases in the AI systems are reduced to assure the developed technologies will be used equitably across all patient populations (37).\nFuture research in AI for neurological emergencies must focus on creating more interpretable and transparent AI systems. While deep learning models have shown great promise, their complexity often makes it difficult for clinicians to understand the rationale behind their recommendations. Developing explainable AI models will not only foster greater trust in these systems but also improve clinical adoption. Additionally, there is a need for longitudinal studies that assess the long-term outcomes of AI-driven interventions. Most current studies focus on immediate improvements, but the sustainability of these benefits over time remains unclear. Addressing these gaps is critical to ensuring the widespread and equitable application of AI in neurology.\nDespite the promising strides made in AI applications for neurological emergencies, significant gaps remain in the current body of research. One key area that has been underexplored is the deployment of AI in low-resource settings. Most AI technologies in neurology are developed and tested in high-resource environments equipped with state-of-the-art imaging devices and computational infrastructure (34). However, in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where healthcare resources are scarce, the implementation of these AI systems faces considerable challenges. Research is urgently needed to modify AI systems for use in such settings, focusing on technologies that require less computational power, can work with limited or lower-quality data, and are cost-effective (38). The lack of studies in this area exacerbates the global inequality in healthcare access, and addressing this gap is crucial for ensuring that AI can benefit patients worldwide, regardless of geographic or economic barriers (43).\nAnother gap in the literature pertains to the long-term efficacy of AI-driven interventions. While there is substantial evidence showing the short-term benefits of AI in acute neurological conditions, such as rapid diagnosis and treatment of stroke (12), the impact of these interventions over extended periods remains unclear. For example, the use of AI in predicting stroke outcomes has demonstrated immediate improvements in treatment speed, but studies rarely follow patients long enough to evaluate the sustainability of these outcomes (18). Longitudinal studies are necessary to assess whether AI-driven improvements in the acute phase translate into long-term health benefits, particularly in managing chronic conditions like epilepsy and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Furthermore, these studies should investigate how AI-driven diagnostics and treatments affect patients’ quality of life, rehabilitation outcomes, and overall healthcare costs in the long term (35).\nAdditionally, the literature is disproportionately focused on a handful of well-known neurological conditions, such as stroke, Alzheimer’s disease, and epilepsy, while rare and complex conditions remain largely unexplored (9). For instance, there is a scarcity of studies examining AI’s potential in diagnosing and managing conditions like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Huntington’s disease, despite the fact that these diseases could greatly benefit from the pattern recognition and predictive capabilities of AI systems (7). Expanding research to include these less common but equally devastating neurological disorders is essential for creating a comprehensive understanding of AI’s role in neurology.\nLastly, researchers need to develop knowledge of how the technology might be scaled up and made more accessible in the future, in the understudied conditions of low-resource use. Although developed, AI had captured significant goodwill where high-resource conditions prevail, several issues underscore the need for technologists and developers to develop insights about how these technologies will be transported for use in low-resource-exploiting conditions, where advanced medical care afforded by high-resource usage is too expensive. This is important for developing AI solutions that are affordable and scalable and therefore would ensure benefits in neurology are made available to all patients, regardless of their origin or economic status.\nFunding Statement\nThe author(s) declare that no financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nAuthor contributions\nMA: Writing – review & editing, Writing – original draft, Visualization, Resources, Formal analysis, Conceptualization.

Accurately predicting cardiovascular disease poses a significant challenge within clinical data analysis. The present study introduces a prediction model that utilizes various combinations of information and employs multiple established classification approaches. The proposed technique combines the genetic algorithm (GA) and the recursive feature elimination method (RFEM) to select relevant features, thus enhancing the model’s robustness. Techniques like the under sampling clustering oversampling method (USCOM) address the issue of data imbalance, thereby improving the model’s predictive capabilities. The classification challenge employs a multilayer deep convolutional neural network (MLDCNN), trained using the adaptive elephant herd optimization method (AEHOM). The proposed machine learning-based heart disease prediction method (ML-HDPM) demonstrates outstanding performance across various crucial evaluation parameters, as indicated by its comprehensive assessment. During the training process, the ML-HDPM model exhibits a high level of performance, achieving an accuracy rate of 95.5% and a precision rate of 94.8%. The system’s sensitivity (recall) performs with a high accuracy rate of 96.2%, while the F-score highlights its well-balanced performance, measuring 91.5%. It is worth noting that the specificity of ML-HDPM is recorded at a remarkable 89.7%. The findings underscore the potential of ML-HDPM to transform the prediction of heart disease and aid healthcare practitioners in providing precise diagnoses, exerting a substantial influence on patient care outcomes.\nSimilar content being viewed by others\nIntroduction\nHealthcare encompasses a range of disciplines. It focuses on preventing, diagnosing, treating, and caring for illnesses and ailments that impact people’s and communities’ overall health and welfare1. The scope of services is extensive, including diverse offerings such as medical exams, interventions, psychological assistance, and public health activities. Healthcare professionals, encompassing a diverse range of individuals such as physicians, nurses, therapists, and researchers, engage in collaborative efforts to safeguard the whole well-being of patients, surrounding their physical, mental, and emotional health. Alongside clinical treatment, healthcare contains health information, illness prevention, and health advancement, all of which improve the overall quality of life2.\nHeart disease, an often-seen and frequently consequential medical ailment, has a profound interdependence with the broader healthcare domain3. Heart disease is a significant contributor to illness and death worldwide, underscoring the crucial role of healthcare systems in tackling pressing health concerns. Heart disease comprises a range of conditions that impact the heart and blood arteries, including heart failure, coronary artery disease, arrhythmias, and valve abnormalities. Healthcare professionals are crucial in diagnosing heart disease by using medical evaluations, employing modern imaging methods, and conducting diagnostic procedures4. The management of the condition involves a comprehensive approach encompassing lifestyle adjustments, pharmaceutical therapies, and surgical procedures, highlighting the need for interdisciplinary cooperation among healthcare professionals. Healthcare efforts that prioritize the promotion of heart-healthy habits, the enhancement of perception, and the advocacy for early detection play a crucial role in mitigating the prevalence of heart disease and enhancing cardiovascular well-being on a broader scope. Examining and controlling cardiovascular disease exemplify the complex interaction between healthcare and the welfare of people and society5.\nCardiovascular disorders rank first among the most lethal illnesses. They are well recognized as a significant contributor to mortality on a worldwide scale6. Based on statistical data from the World Health Organization, it was reported that cardiac disorders were responsible for about 18 million fatalities in 2016. In the United States, cardiovascular illnesses, including heart disease, hypertension, and stroke, are the leading causes of mortality. Cardiovascular heart disease (CHD) is responsible for about one-seventh of all fatalities in the United States, resulting in an estimated yearly death toll of 3 million individuals7. The prevalence of myocardial infarctions in the United States is roughly 7.9 million, accounting for approximately 3% of heart attack incidents among American adults. In the year 2015, a total of 1 million individuals inside a single nation succumbed to fatalities resulting from heart attacks8. Based on the findings of a study, the symptoms associated with heart disease include a range of manifestations such as chest tightness, discomfort, pressure, breath shortness, leg shivers, neck pain, abdomen pain, tachycardia, dizziness, bradycardia, fainting, syncope, which skin color modifications, leg swelling, weight loss, and weariness9. The symptoms of heart illness, including arrhythmia, myocardia, heart failure, congenital heart disease, mitral regurgitation, and dilated cardiomyopathy, exhibit variation based on their specific nature.\nThe risk factors associated with heart disease include several aspects such as advanced age, genetic predisposition, tobacco use, physical behaviors, substance misuse, elevated cholesterol levels, hypertension, sedentary lifestyle, obesity, diabetes, psychological stress, and inadequate hygiene practices10. The gravity of cardiovascular disease mandates the implementation of a screening protocol for its diagnosis. In the screening procedure, medical professionals provide many diagnostic tests, including blood glucose level testing, cholesterol testing, blood pressure measurement, electrocardiography (ECG), ultrasound imaging, cardiac computer tomography (CT), calcium scoring, and stress testing. The screening procedure requires significant time-consuming manual tasks and human involvement.\nThe primary contributions of the research are listed below:\n-\nUsing the GA and RFEM in advanced feature selection guarantees identifying the most relevant features, reducing interference and augmenting the model’s predictive capability.\n-\nUsing feature extraction methodologies extends beyond merely selecting raw attributes, converting the data into a more comprehensive and informative representation. This process enhances the input for later analysis.\n-\nUSCOM techniques tackle the prevalent issue of uneven data distribution, enhancing the model’s capacity to generalize well across different classes.\n-\nUsing a MLDCNN in classification exploits the ability of deep learning to capture detailed patterns present in complicated databases effectively, improving the model’s prediction performance.\n-\nThe AEHOM facilitates the refinement of the model’s parameters, enhancing its performance and promoting effective convergence during training.\nThe following sections are arranged in the given manner: “Background and literature survey”aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the backdrop around heart disease prediction and thoroughly examine pertinent previous research conducted in this field. “Proposed heart disease prediction system” describes the unique machine learning-based heart disease prediction method (ML-HDPM) approach, which integrates feature selection, feature extraction, UAO, MLDCNN, and AEHOM techniques to achieve precise prediction. “Simulation analysis and findings” presents and analyzes the numerical results, emphasizing the better effectiveness of the ML-HDPM model in predicting heart disease. “Conclusions” provides a concise overview of the obtained results, examines their ramifications, and delineates potential directions for future investigations and improvements within the domain.\nBackground and literature survey\nCardiovascular disorders have been widely acknowledged as one of the primary contributors to mortality. Several research investigations have been conducted to examine the use of predictive models in forecasting indicators associated with the likelihood of developing cardiac disorders based on health data found in the existing literature. The latest advancements in machine learning tools and algorithms have stimulated research efforts in creating methodologies and techniques for detecting cardiac disease. Numerous methods have been explored to address this issue, including classification, clustering, etc.\nThe work conducted by Abdullatif et al. introduces a novel approach that combines supervised infinite feature selection with an enhanced weighted random forest algorithm to detect heart disease11. The process is selected to improve the significance of features and the model’s accuracy. The simulation results show significant improvement, achieving an accuracy rate of 92.14%, a sensitivity rate of 92.50%, and a specificity rate of 91.78%. This methodology presents an enhanced approach for detecting cardiac illness, potentially increasing patients’ survival rates.\nMuhammad et al. propose a sophisticated computer model to identify cardiac illness precisely12. The solution being presented utilizes machine learning methods to get accurate diagnoses. The model demonstrates favorable results, achieving an accuracy rate of 92.42%, a sensitivity rate of 92.40%, and a specificity rate of 92.44%. This work showcases the capacity of intelligent computational models to diagnose cardiac disease with precision and efficiency.\nArnaout et al. provide a novel approach, including using an ensemble of neural networks for the accurate prenatal detection of complicated congenital heart disease13. The use of neural networks in this approach enables precise diagnostic outcomes. The ensemble exhibits exceptional performance, attaining an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve value of 0.98. The research emphasizes the possibility of using neural network ensembles to identify fetal cardiac disease.\nThe study conducted by Alkhodari et al. centers on diagnosing valvular heart disease using convolutional and recurrent neural networks (CNNs and RNNs) applied to phonocardiogram recordings14. The selection of CNNs and RNNs is appropriate for data organized in sequences. The findings exhibit a noteworthy outcome, showcasing an overarching precision rate of 95.86%. This underscores the effectiveness of using deep learning techniques in the realm of diagnosing valvular heart disease.\nThe heart disease diagnosis approach using machine learning classification in the field of e-healthcare is proposed by Li et al.15. The research utilizes a range of classification techniques to enhance the precision of identification. The Random Forest classifier has notable performance, with an accuracy rate of 90.47%, a precision value of 0.909, and a recall value of 0.912. This method places significant emphasis on using machine learning techniques within the field of e-healthcare, specifically to accurately identify cases of heart disease.\nDixit et al. demonstrated the use of a cost-effective and portable ECG sensor for the early identification of cardiovascular disease16. Their suggested solution utilizes machine learning algorithms to process ECG data. The system encompasses several characteristics, such as capturing, preprocessing, and categorizing ECG signals. The simulation findings demonstrate a high level of accuracy, namely 95.2%, in diagnosing cardiac illnesses. This highlights the potential for using a low-cost ECG sensor as an effective means of early detection.\nAlsafi et al. introduced a sophisticated machine-learning system to diagnose coronary heart disease17. The presented approach utilizes machine learning methodologies to examine patient data, effectively using their characteristics for precise diagnoses. The simulation results demonstrate a notable level of precision, with an accuracy rate of 97.4%. This highlights their methodology’s potential to improve coronary heart disease diagnosis.\nAli et al. provided a novel healthcare monitoring system to anticipate cardiac disease18. The proposed method employs ensemble deep learning and feature fusion techniques to analyze patient data. The technique’s effectiveness is shown by its ability to achieve a prediction accuracy of 92.34% in the context of heart disease, highlighting the promise of ensemble deep learning as a reliable approach for monitoring healthcare.\nGárate-Escamila et al. focused on predicting heart disease using classification models, feature selection techniques, and principal component analysis (PCA)19. The suggested methodology emphasizes the importance of feature selection and dimensionality reduction. The simulation findings demonstrate a competitive level of performance, as shown by an accuracy rate of 87.5% obtained via the use of PCA. This outcome highlights the promising capabilities of these approaches in the realm of heart disease prediction.\nSonawane et al. proposed a heart disease prediction model that integrates data and ECG signals using a hybrid clustering approach20. The proposed method combines clustering methodologies with machine learning algorithms to achieve precise prediction. The suggested method achieves a classification accuracy of 92.6%, offering the possibility of using hybrid clustering techniques to enhance the prediction of cardiac illness by integrating both traditional data and ECG signals.\nThe literature review elucidates many methodologies for diagnosing and predicting heart illness, including advanced machine learning, deep learning, and sensor-based data-collecting strategies. Although these methodologies provide encouraging outcomes, several limitations arise, such as inconsistent diagnostic precision and possible issues related to overfitting. The suggested methods effectively tackle these issues by incorporating cutting-edge technology and feature selection procedures, augmenting the accuracy and dependability of heart disease diagnosis and prognosis.\nProposed heart disease prediction system\nThe research endeavors to establish a comprehensive framework for achieving precise heart disease prediction, employing a multifaceted approach that integrates advanced machine learning methodologies, feature selection, and dimensionality reduction techniques. By harnessing sophisticated machine learning algorithms, the model adeptly discerns intricate patterns embedded within patient data, utilizing ensemble deep learning and innovative feature fusion strategies. This holistic strategy ensures the accurate and timely prognosis of cardiac disease, furnishing healthcare practitioners with a valuable tool to enhance patient treatment outcomes.\nMoreover, the hybrid system encompasses three pivotal stages: data gathering, pre-processing, and classification, each playing pivotal roles in refining the predictive model. During the meticulous pre-processing phase, a series of tasks are meticulously executed to uphold data integrity and model efficacy. These tasks encompass the meticulous imputation of missing data, wherein the ML-HDPM method is proficiently utilized to accurately estimate absent values within the database. Furthermore, exhaustive feature selection endeavors are undertaken to pinpoint the most pertinent attributes for predictive modeling. This process is facilitated by a hybrid technique that synergistically amalgamates the capabilities of genetic algorithm (GA) and recursive feature elimination method (RFEM), facilitating the identification of informative features crucial for precise predictions.\nAdditionally, to ensure uniformity in the impact of features, a conventional scalar approach is employed to recalibrate the coefficients of all features, aligning their means to 0 and standard deviations to 1, thereby mitigating potential biases stemming from feature scale discrepancies. Within the database, classification is facilitated by delineating between two distinct classes: class 0 and class 1, representing the absence and presence of heart disease, respectively. Specifically, 164 cases are attributed to class 0, indicative of the absence of heart disease, while 139 instances are categorized as class 1, denoting the presence of heart disease. To mitigate the inherent class imbalance, the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) is deployed, ensuring equitable representation of both classes and bolstering the model’s predictive prowess across diverse scenarios.\nImplementation of the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) within the research framework entails a systematic approach to redress the inherent class imbalance between class 0 (indicating the absence of heart disease) and class 1 (signifying the presence of heart disease). SMOTE functions by generating synthetic samples from the minority class, thereby augmenting its representation within the dataset. This technique involves selecting individual instances from the minority class and creating synthetic instances along the line segments connecting them to their nearest neighbors. By interpolating between existing instances, SMOTE effectively enhances the diversity of the minority class without introducing biases, thus fostering a balanced representation of both classes. This approach fortifies the model’s predictive capabilities, ensuring robust performance across a myriad of scenarios and enhancing its utility in clinical practice.\nSpecifically, SMOTE facilitates equitable representation of both classes, enabling the model to learn from a more diverse range of examples and effectively capture the underlying patterns and nuances associated with both the presence and absence of heart disease. As a result, the predictive model becomes more adept at accurately discerning between cases of heart disease and non-heart disease, thereby enhancing its diagnostic precision and reliability. Additionally, by mitigating the impact of class imbalance, SMOTE contributes to the model’s generalizability and robustness, ensuring consistent performance across diverse patient populations and clinical settings. Overall, the integration of SMOTE into the proposed model significantly enhances its predictive capabilities, ultimately empowering healthcare practitioners with a more effective tool for accurate heart disease diagnosis and prognosis.\nThe methodology generates artificial instances of underrepresented categories, achieving a balanced distribution across both types. The process of classification involves the use of chosen characteristics and using various classifiers such as support vector machine (SVM)21, PCA22, linear discriminant analysis (LDA)23, naïve Bayes (NB)24, decision tree (DT)25, and random forest (RF)26. Ultimately, the classifier predicts an individual’s presence or absence of heart disease. The mechanism used in the suggested approach for heart disease forecasting is shown in Fig. 1.\nPre-processing\nThis first phase is the primary step of the diagnostic procedure. The process consists of three stages: substituting absent qualities, eliminating duplications, and segregation. A characteristic’s missing value is substituted after a comprehensive examination of the patient’s age category, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure levels. If the majority of attribute values of a patient exhibit similarity, the corresponding value is replaced in the same spot. The redundancy reduction process aims to decrease the quantity of data by eliminating redundant or useless qualities. The patients are categorized according to the specific form of chest pain they exhibit, namely: (1) classic angina, (2) atypical angina, (3) non-anginal suffering, and (4) asymptomatic suffering.\nFeature selection\nThe GA is founded on the principles of natural selection. The algorithm produces many solutions within a single generation. Each solution is referred to as a genome. The aggregate of solutions within a single generation is often called the population. The algorithm undergoes several iterations across generations to provide an improved result. During each process iteration, genetic algorithms are used on genomes derived from previous generations to generate the generation. Selection, crossovers, and mutations are genetic operators often used in genetic algorithms.\nThe selection agent is responsible for choosing the most optimal people from every age group. A fitness function assesses each person’s fitness level about others within the general population. The genomes that a selection agent chooses are then put into the mating pool, contributing to the formation of the following generation. The crossover agent is a genetic algorithm technique that combines individuals from mating pools to generate improved offspring for generations. Various crossover agents exist, including single-point, two-point, and multipoint crossover. If a mixture is not introduced into the general population, individuals in the following generation will likely exhibit similarities to the preceding population. The variety is presented using a mutation manager, which introduces random alterations to the individuals. The process of the genetic algorithm’s development is shown in Fig. 2.\nA total of 18 iterations have been used. A total of 80 genomes were chosen in every successive generation. A total of 40 optimal genomes were selected at each age and then transmitted to the next generation. A total of 40 genomes were picked randomly. A crossover rate of 5% and a mutation rate 0.05 were used. The user’s data is negated. The fitness of the genomes was determined by using the mean square error of the genome as the objective function. The RFEM method is an iterative process that recursively eliminates unnecessary characteristics. The classifier undergoes training using the provided training data, and afterward, the significance of the features is determined by calculation. The least influential elements are eliminated during each process iteration, and the model is retrained using the remaining subset of features. The procedures are executed iteratively until the necessary quantity of features is attained. The method receives the number of characteristics to be maintained as a parameter. The functionality of the RFEM method is shown in Fig. 3.\nHeart feature extraction\nThe investigation involves the extraction of diverse attributes from the medical data obtained via healthcare devices. The database comprises several physiological measurements, including heart rate, arterial pressure, and blood sugar level. To accurately determine the presence of cardiac disease, it is essential to extract critical characteristics, including statistical and temporal aspects. The equations provided below constitute the list of feature extraction.\nThe maximum voltage, total harmonic distortion (THD), heart rate, zero crossing rate (ZCR), entropy (ent), energy (eg), and standard deviation (SD) are expressed in Eqs. (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7).\nThe voltage is denoted V, the harmonic component is denoted HC, the probability of frequency filter is denoted \\({P}_{ff}\\), the signal change and signal no change are expressed \\({S}_{c} {\\text{and}} {S}_{nc}\\). The probability is expressed \\({P}_{xy}\\), and the deviation is denoted k. The collected data contains an interval referred to as RR. The variation is expressed in Eq. (8).\nThe variable M represents the aggregate count of RR intervals in the database. The root mean square of the sum of the consecutive differences is expressed in Eq. (9).\n\\({RR}_{x}\\) refers to the integrated heartbeat, k represents the mean value, and \\({P}_{xy}\\) signifies the probability value. The qualities have been derived from the medical gadget data. The retrieved properties are retained as factors to forecast heart disease and alterations in the heart pattern. The ensuing section explains the intricate procedure involved in identifying heart disease.\nCluster-based over-sampled method\nA novel approach has been devised using resampling and grouping methodologies to handle unbalanced stroke data. Resampling techniques include both under sampling and oversampling methods. Under sampling is a technique to remove data points from the majority class specimens selectively. Oversampling is used to augment the representation of minority specimens. Grouping is the process of grouping data so that models within each group exhibit similar qualities.\nFigure 4 illustrates the primary operations inside the system that has been developed. The method performs an under sampling function on collecting specimens with majority labels. Clustering is performed on the subset of minority labels within the overall data set. The example set generated by the underestimating procedure is separated into distinct testing, training, and validation sets. This division is done according to the ratio of 8:1:1. The acquired training sets have been combined. The validation sets, and testing sets have been completed. Next, the SMOTE algorithm performs oversampling on the specimens with minority labels inside the merged training set, resulting in the acquisition of the final stage of training data27. In the concluding training set, the quantity of positive tests is about equivalent to the number of negative specimens, and each category of positive model is comprised. This training database offers an abundant number of examples that are used for the training of machine learning algorithms to extract characteristics. The method generates balanced activity, verification, and testing sets.\nFigure 5 illustrates the UCOM process for heart disease prediction. The UCOM algorithm is comprised of three distinct parts. The number of individuals without heart attacks is much larger than those without, so the data set of individuals without heart attacks is underrepresented. The random underestimating procedure resulted in the selection of specimen number 120. The prediction outcome achieved with a specimen count of 120 demonstrates superior performance. A clustering operation is performed on the specimens associated with heart attacks to ensure the inclusion of distinct characteristics from each subgroup of close-distance data throughout the training process. To get a balanced distribution of specimens with and without heart attacks throughout the training, oversampling is used for the models with heart attacks.\n-\n(1) The use of under sampling techniques to the majority class of negative specimens, namely those about stroke without heart attack cases. Most specimens, namely those without heart attack but with stroke, were picked randomly to create three subsets: a training subset, a validation subset, and a testing subset. The UCOM technique incorporates the parameter of randomized pick specimens, which depends on the data collection characteristics and the specimen set representing the minority label. The ratio of models with a heart attack to specimens without cardiac attack in the MIMIC-III database is 2:3, indicating an under sampling percentage28. In the MIMIC-III database, the stroke specimens database entails randomly selecting two-thirds of the stroke specimens, excluding those that include heart attacks.\n-\n(2) Clustering the specimen set consisting of minority labels, namely stroke and heart attack data, is being performed.\nThe research used a clustering algorithm to aggregate minority specimens, namely stroke specimens with cardiac arrest, into several clusters. Next, divide each group into three sets: the set for training, validation, and testing set. This division should be done by the ratio 8:1:1. The number of K is obtained by calculating the mean square error. The computation of the Sum of Squared Errors (SSE) is represented by Eq. (10).\n$$E=\\sum_{i=0}^{{C}_{x}}{\\left|i-{m}_{x}\\right|}^{2}$$(10)\\({C}_{x}\\) represents the x-th cluster, \\(i\\) denotes the specimen inside \\({C}_{x}\\), and \\({m}_{x}\\) refers to the centroid of \\({C}_{x}\\)\n-\n(3) The process of dividing and combining clusters.\nThe underspecified specimens and each cluster are divided into training, validation, and testing sets using an 8:1:1 ratio. These sets are combined to create a new activity, validation, and testing set. The three newly introduced groups consist of training, verification, and testing sets.\n-\n(4) One approach to address the class imbalance in the training set is to use the SMOTE to specimen the pseudo training set.\nSMOTE method is a sampling technique designed to address imbalanced databases by generating synthetic specimens for the minority class. The method exhibits enhancements above the random sampling approach. The pseudo training set should be inputted into the SMOTE algorithm. The method employs a random selection process to choose specimens with a minority label and then identifies the closest neighbors. The system produces additional models with the minority label inside the set of centering specimens and their corresponding neighbour’s. The algorithm continues its execution until the count of samples with the minority label equals the count of models with the majority label. At this point, it produces the updated training set.\nClassification method\nThe MLDCNN is a deep-learning neural network that utilizes the AEHOM for weight value optimization. Following the process of feature selection, the selected features are subjected to classification using the MLDCNN. The MLDCNN classifier receives each chosen component as its input in this context. The weights are arbitrarily given values associated with each piece of information. The concealed nodes inside the succeeding concealed layer compute the sum of the input value multiplied by the weight vector associated with all the input nodes connected to it. Random weight values have been shown to enhance the efficacy of the backpropagation process in obtaining the desired outcome. The optimization process is conducted in this manner. The activation procedure is then used, and the output of this layer is sent to the subsequent layer. The weights have a significant impact on the work of the classifier. The classification process in the MLDCNN involves a series of algorithmic phases, outlined as follows.\nStep 1: Eqs. (11), (12) represent the feature values and their corresponding weights.\nThe symbol \\({F}_{x}\\) represents the input value, which represents a selection of n features denoted as \\({F}_{1},{F}_{2},\\cdots ,{F}_{m}\\). Similarly, \\({W}_{x}\\) represents the weight value of \\({F}_{x}\\), which shows the appropriate weights for the n features as \\({W}_{1},{W}_{2},\\cdots ,{W}_{m}\\).\nStep 2: The inputs are multiplied by weight vectors that have been randomly selected, and the resulting products are then summed using Eq. (13).\nThe input and the weight are denoted \\(F, and W\\). \\(M\\) represents the aggregate value.\nStep 3: The objective is to ascertain that the activation function is expressed in Eq. (14) and the classification function is expressed in Eq. (15).\nThe symbol \\({A}_{{f}_{x}}\\) represents the activation operation, whereas \\({C}_{x}\\) represents the exponential of \\({F}_{x}\\). The suggested system employs a Gaussian function as a kind of activation function.\nStep 4: Assess the hidden layer output using a rigorous evaluation using Eq. (16).\nThe bias value is denoted as \\({B}_{x}\\), whereas the weight across the hidden input and layers is specified as \\({W}_{x}\\). The classification function is denoted \\({C}_{x}\\).\nStep 5: The three processes above are executed for every layer inside the MLDCNN. The output unit is assessed by aggregating the weights of every input signal to get the values of the neurons in the layer that produces signals expressed in Eq. (17).\nThe variable \\({O}_{x}\\) represents the value of the level that comes before the resultant layer, \\({W}_{x}\\) identifies the layer weights concealed, and \\({R}_{x}\\) denotes the measurement unit of the output.\nStep 6: This stage involves the comparison of the output generated by the network with the desired target value. The disparity between these two quantities is often called the error signal. The mathematical expression for this disparity is expressed in Eq. (18).\nThe error indication, denoted as \\({E}_{x}\\), represents the discrepancy between the actual and desired output, specified by \\({D}_{x}\\). In this step, a comparison is made between the value of the output metric and the goal value. The associated mistake is identified. The error at the output is sent back to all other devices in the network by computing a value \\({k}_{x}\\) according to this mistake, denoted in Eq. (19).\nHeart rate is denoted \\({R}_{x}\\), and the error disparity is expressed \\({E}_{x}\\).\nStep 7: The use of the backpropagation technique achieves the weight adjustment. The provided relation is presented in Eq. (20).\nThe weight adjustment is denoted by \\({W}_{{c}_{x}}\\), the momentum is represented by \\(\\alpha\\), and \\({k}_{x}\\) refers to the mistake dispersed throughout the network. The weight values are adjusted using the AEHOM technique.\nAEHOM\nThe AEHOM framework is based on the notion that the elephant population is divided into several clans. Each clan has a distinct quantity of elephants. Typically, male elephants separate from their clans and choose a solitary lifestyle. The leadership of each clan is entrusted to the oldest female elephant, commonly called the matriarch. In a herd of elephants, the matriarchs are known to choose the most favorable option, whereas the male elephants’ attitude indicates the least favorable alternative. The elephant population is divided into several clans. Every individual, denoted as v, belonging to a particular family, indicated as c, is directed by the matriarch, denoted as \\({E}_{n}\\), who has the most significant fitness value within the given generation. The procedure above is represented by Eq. (21).\n\\({P}_{x+1,{E}_{n,v}}\\) denotes the updated position of the variable u in the context of the algorithm c. \\({P}_{x,{E}_{n}}\\) reflects the prior location of u, while \\({P}_{{E}_{n,v}}\\) signifies the optimal solution of \\({E}_{n,v}\\). The variable c, which belongs to the interval [0, 1], determines the impact of the matriarch in the procedure. \\({R}_{D}\\) is a random number employed to enhance population diversity during the method's later phases. The optimal location of the elephant inside clan \\({P}_{x+1,{E}_{n,v}}\\) is revised via Eq. (22).\nThe symbol l represents a parameter within the range of [0, 1]. This variable significantly determines how \\({P}_{c,{E}_{n}}\\) influences the overall outcome, as shown in Eq. (23).\nThe variable \\({b}_{{E}_{n},y,l}\\) represents the yth dimension, where l is more than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to L. The variable L represents the total width of the space. \\(V{E}_{n}\\) symbolizes the number of elephants in clan c.\nMale elephants that separate from their social group are used to conduct exploratory activities. A subset of elephants exhibiting the lowest fitness values within each clan is assigned new locations, as Eq. (24) shows\nThe variables are defined as follows: \\({P}_{min}\\) represents the lower limit of the searching space. \\({P}_{max}\\) represents the upper bound of the searching area. The variable k is constrained to the interval [0, 1]. A stochastic variable generated from a uniform probability distribution.\nAfter evaluating the placements of the elephants, mutation and crossing procedures are implemented to enhance the optimization process. The use of a two-point crossover is implemented. This approach involves the selection of two sites on the parental genome. The genetic material between these two specific locations undergoes reciprocal exchange between the parent’s genomes, resulting in the acquisition of the offspring’s genome. These points are evaluated in Eqs. (25) and (26).\nThe mutation process (\\({P}_{x+1,{E}_{n}}\\)) entails exchanging a certain number of genes from each genome with novel genes. The exchanged genes refer to the genetically modified genes intentionally introduced into the genome without duplication. The procedure is iteratively executed until a solution exhibiting a higher fitness level is achieved.\nThe presented technique incorporates a comprehensive approach to predicting cardiac disease, which involves feature selection, data preparation, and machine learning algorithms. The data about patients is extracted and processed, resulting in the identification of valuable aspects. These characteristics are used in advanced machine learning methods, such as ensemble deep learning and classification methodologies. This merger aims to enhance precision and expedite the prognosis of cardiac disease with accuracy.\nSimulation analysis and findings\nThe performance of the suggested strategy is evaluated via thorough testing in the simulation part. Multiple metrics, including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision, are calculated to assess the predictive efficacy of the methodology. The effectiveness of the suggested strategy is validated by a comparative study conducted against current models.\nDatabases\nThe UCI machine learning database, comprising four databases including the Cleveland database29, the Hungary database30, the Switzerland database31, and the Long Beach database, was utilized to gather data on heart illness32. Specifically, the Cleveland database was selected for this study due to its widespread use among machine learning researchers and its provision of comprehensive information. With a total of 303 entries, the Cleveland database originally contained 76 characteristics, although the dataset available in the repository includes information for only a subset of 14 features. Sourced primarily from the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, the Cleveland database serves as the primary data source for this study. The prediction of heart disease involves the consideration of 13 qualities, with one attribute serving as the output or anticipated attribute indicating the existence of heart disease in a patient.\nNotably, the database from Cleveland includes a feature called “num,” which represents the finding of heart disease in individuals on a scale ranging from 0 to 4. A numerical value of 0 signifies the absence of heart illness, while values from 1 to 4 denote individuals afflicted with heart disease, with the scale indicating the degree of severity (with four being the most severe). Additionally, the study employed a modified bee method and k-fold cross-validation for robust analysis.\nExperimental setup for evaluation\nThe tests were conducted based on specific parameters and methodologies, including: (1) conducting the study using the entire database without employing any data-reducing methods, (2) experimenting with a reduced database by selecting a subset of the original data, and (3) experimenting with a modified bee method on the reduced database. The modified bee method, an adaptation of the traditional bee algorithm for optimization, was specifically tailored to enhance performance within the context of the study by iteratively exploring and optimizing parameters. These tests were executed on a system setup comprising an i5 CPU with 3 GB of RAM, utilizing the MATLAB 9.2 program for model construction. In each experiment, the data in the database was utilized to train and test the model, with different subsets or modifications applied as per the experimental conditions. Additionally, the study employed k-fold cross-validation, where the dataset was divided into k subsets, with each subset used as a testing set while the remaining data served as training sets. This process was repeated k times, and the performance metric computed the mean value over ‘k’ iterations to ensure robust evaluation of the model’s performance under varying conditions.\nSimulation results\nThe simulation results of the proposed method are analyzed, and the results are compared with the existing models.\nThe accuracy analysis depicted in Fig. 6 showcases the effectiveness of the machine learning hybrid deep predictive model (ML-HDPM) approach in predicting heart disease. Compared to other algorithms, ML-HDPM achieves notably higher training accuracy (95.5%) and testing accuracy (89.1%). This significant improvement is attributed to the integration of various advanced methodologies within the model. Firstly, ML-HDPM employs sophisticated feature selection techniques to identify the most relevant attributes related to cardiovascular health, thereby enabling the model to discern subtle patterns indicative of heart disease. Additionally, the utilization of data balancing techniques ensures that the model is trained on a representative sample of both positive and negative instances, leading to more accurate predictions. Furthermore, the incorporation of deep learning capabilities through the MLDCNN architecture allows the model to automatically learn intricate patterns and relationships within the data, further enhancing its predictive accuracy. Lastly, optimization using the adaptive elephant herding optimization methodology (AEHOM) fine-tunes the model parameters and weights, resulting in improved accuracy. Overall, the synergistic integration of these methodologies enables ML-HDPM to accurately predict heart disease, thus demonstrating its potential to enhance clinical decision-making and patient care.\nFigure 7 illustrates the precision analysis of heart disease prediction, showcasing the performance of the machine learning hybrid deep predictive model (ML-HDPM) technique. Notably, ML-HDPM achieves higher precision rates in both training (94.8%) and testing (88.3%) phases compared to alternative algorithms. This success can be attributed to the holistic approach adopted by ML-HDPM, which integrates several key methodologies. Firstly, the model employs advanced feature selection techniques to identify relevant attributes critical for accurate heart disease prediction. Additionally, ML-HDPM addresses data imbalances through effective data balancing methods, ensuring that the model is trained on a representative dataset. Moreover, the integration of deep learning capabilities using the MLDCNN architecture, enhanced by AEHOM optimization, further contributes to the model’s precision. By adeptly managing feature relevance and addressing data imbalances, ML-HDPM demonstrates enhanced accuracy in detecting heart disease patterns. These results underscore the importance of the proposed methodology in accurately diagnosing cardiac diseases, thus highlighting its significance in clinical decision-making and ultimately improving patient outcomes.\nFigure 8 depicts the false positive rate (FPR) analysis of various methods for predicting heart disease, with the machine learning hybrid deep predictive model (ML-HDPM) technique exhibiting notably lower FPR values during both training (8.2%) and testing (14.7%) phases compared to alternative methods. This accomplishment can be attributed to the synergistic utilization of feature selection, data balancing, and enhanced deep learning components within the ML-HDPM framework. By employing these strategies, the model enhances its capability to accurately identify instances that do not have heart disease, thereby reducing the number of cases falsely identified as positive. Consequently, the suggested approach demonstrates efficacy in minimizing misclassification errors, a crucial aspect for achieving precise predictions of cardiac diseases and ultimately improving patient care outcomes.\nFigure 9 illustrates the true positive rate (TPR) analysis across various algorithms for predicting heart disease, highlighting the machine learning hybrid deep predictive model (ML-HDPM) technique’s superior performance. During both training and testing phases, ML-HDPM achieves notably higher TPR values, with 96.2% and 90.8%, respectively. This success can be attributed to the comprehensive methodology employed by ML-HDPM, which encompasses the identification of relevant features, data balancing, and optimization of deep learning techniques. By leveraging these strategies, ML-HDPM effectively utilizes its feature-rich and balanced database to accurately detect true positives, resulting in an enhanced TPR. These results underscore the potential of ML-HDPM in bolstering the prediction of heart disease, thereby facilitating more precise diagnoses and ultimately leading to better patient outcomes.\nThe ML-HDPM technique has superior performance in terms of F-scores, achieving better scores in both training (91.5%) and testing (89.6%) compared to other algorithms. The F score results of the different models are expressed in Fig. 10. The success of this accomplishment is ascribed to the comprehensive nature of the methodology, which integrates feature selection, data balance, and deep learning optimization techniques. ML-HDPM successfully captures meaningful patterns in heart disease data, resulting in higher F-scores by establishing a balance between accuracy and recall. The results highlight the potential of ML-HDPM in accurately predicting heart disease, hence improving the whole diagnostic process and patient treatment.\nThe simulation findings presented in the study highlight the effectiveness of the machine learning hybrid deep predictive model (ML-HDPM) approach in accurately predicting heart disease. With a training accuracy of 95.5% and a testing accuracy of 89.1%, ML-HDPM outperforms other algorithms, demonstrating its exceptional performance in both sets. This superiority is further supported by the accuracy values of 94.8% for training and 88.3% for testing, underscoring the model’s effectiveness across different datasets expressed in Fig. 11. Moreover, ML-HDPM showcases a significant reduction in false positive rates (FPR), with rates of 8.2% during training and 14.7% during testing. This reduction in FPR is crucial as it indicates ML-HDPM’s ability to minimize misclassification errors, thereby improving the accuracy of heart disease prediction. Additionally, ML-HDPM exhibits higher true positive rates (TPR) compared to other algorithms, with rates of 96.2% during training and 90.8% during testing. These higher TPR values reflect ML-HDPM’s capability to accurately detect positive instances of heart disease, contributing to more reliable diagnostic outcomes.\nFurthermore, ML-HDPM achieves balanced F-scores of 91.5% during training and 89.6% during testing, indicating a harmonious blend of precision and recall in its predictions. This balance is crucial for ensuring accurate and reliable heart disease prediction. Regarding specificity, ML-HDPM demonstrates superior performance, with specificity rates of 89.7% in training and 84.2% in testing, surpassing other algorithms. This notable difference in specificity can be attributed to the comprehensive methodology employed by ML-HDPM, which integrates feature selection, data balance, and deep learning optimization techniques. By effectively reducing false positive rates and properly recognizing real negatives, ML-HDPM enhances the precision of heart disease diagnoses, thereby improving patient care outcomes.\nIn summary, the considerable differences observed among the obtained results, particularly in terms of accuracy, false positive rates, true positive rates, F-scores, and specificity, highlight the superior performance of the ML-HDPM approach in predicting heart disease. The comprehensive methodology and integrated techniques utilized by ML-HDPM contribute to its effectiveness in improving accuracy, reducing misclassification errors, and enhancing diagnostic reliability, ultimately leading to better patient care outcomes.\nConclusions\nThe research presents a comprehensive approach, ML-HDPM, aimed at enhancing the prediction of cardiovascular disease by addressing the limitations of traditional diagnostic methods. This approach combines various techniques such as feature selection, data balancing, and deep learning, utilizing the MLDCNN model improved with AEHOM.\nThe results of the study demonstrate promising performance metrics, with high training and testing accuracies, as well as precision rates. The approach also shows improvements in both false positive rates and true positive rates, indicating its potential for accurate prediction while minimizing false alarms. Additionally, the balanced F-scores suggest that the methodology maintains a good balance between precision and recall. These findings suggest that ML-HDPM has the potential to significantly improve the precision of diagnostic assessments for cardiovascular disease, thereby assisting healthcare professionals in making timely and accurate clinical decisions. However, the research also acknowledges the need for further exploration and refinement of the methodology, particularly regarding challenges related to data quality, feature selection, and optimization techniques. Future investigations should aim to expand the scope of inquiry to encompass a broader range of cardiovascular conditions and explore the practical implementation of the findings in real-world healthcare settings. Overall, the study underscores the transformative impact of advanced machine learning methodologies in improving the prediction and management of cardiovascular disease.\nData availability\nThe data presented in this study are available upon request from the corresponding author.\nCode availability\nThe custom code used in this study is openly available and can be accessed via https://github.com/prabukiwi1/Heart-Disease-Diagnosis.

This work contributes to the discourse on responsible AI use in healthcare, offering a blueprint for institutions to navigate the complexities of AI integration responsibly and effectively, thus promoting better, more equitable healthcare outcomes.\nSimilar content being viewed by others\nIntroduction\nThe integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into medicine has advanced markedly, initially making significant strides in medical imaging domains such as radiology, dermatology, pathology, and gastroenterology1. Deep learning models have shown remarkable capabilities, from detecting malignant breast lesions in X-rays2 to identifying diabetic retinopathy in fundus imaging3 and lung nodules in computed tomography scans4, among other applications. Beyond imaging, these models show promise in enhancing clinical decision-making, providing treatment recommendations, and facilitating patient triage5,6,7.\nThe advent of large language models (LLMs) has further expanded AI’s potential in healthcare, showing the potential to improve tasks such as history taking, patient summarization, generation of discharge summaries, procedural coding, and even provision of diagnostic recommendations8.\nAs with other healthcare technologies—such as electronic health records, clinical decision support, and telemedicine—large language models necessitate scrutiny, validation, and ongoing safety monitoring. Beyond past considerations such as usability, patient privacy, workflow adaptation, and training procedures9, AI presents a new set of challenges, such as variability in model performance across different healthcare settings due to out-of-distribution shifts, performance changes over time due to evolving disease prevalence, changes in patient demographics, and the introduction of new medical technologies10,11. LLMs, in particular, face heightened scrutiny over their capacity to generate inaccurate or irrelevant content, the risk of fabricating non-existent information (hallucinations), omitting crucial details in the documentation, and navigating data privacy intricacies during training phases12,13.\nIn response to these rapid developments, regulatory bodies like the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have begun to adapt quickly. However, clear benchmarks for assessing AI models and monitoring their performance over time remain elusive. Leading entities, including the Office of the National Coordinator14, the White House’s AI Bill of Rights blueprint15,16, the Coalition for Health AI (CHAI)17, the World Health Organization18, corporations such as Microsoft19, and professional associations like the American Medical Association20, have begun to establish high-level guidelines. These guidelines emphasize transparency, accountability, equity, privacy, security, safety, reliability, and robustness in AI applications. Despite these efforts, a tangible gap exists in the practical implementation of these guidelines and ongoing oversight of AI within healthcare settings.\nTo bridge this gap, we have developed a comprehensive set of guidelines that encompasses the entire range of AI systems within healthcare, ranging from traditional machine learning models to advanced generative AI technologies. By presenting a detailed case study on the application of this framework to ambient documentation, we emphasize the practicality and immediate relevance of our methodology. Our goal is to provide a foundational blueprint for healthcare institutions, ensuring AI is integrated responsibly and effectively across the healthcare sector.\nMethods\nCrafting guidelines for AI integration in healthcare settings\nWe brought together a cross-functional team of 18 people from our integrated academic healthcare system, including leaders from informatics, legal, research, data analytics, privacy, patient experience, equity, quality, and safety. We first identified critical themes through a peer-reviewed and gray literature search using terms like “AI governance in healthcare”, “AI guidelines/implementations”. Based on this search and our expert consensus approach (using Delphi-like methodology), we focused on nine principles: (1) Fairness, (2) Equity, (3) Robustness, (4) Privacy, (5) Safety, (6) Transparency, (7) Explainability, (8) Accountability, and (9) Benefit (summarized in Table 1). Additionally, recognizing the importance of collaboration across healthcare organizations for AI assurance to ensure AI ethics are upheld collectively, avoiding duplication of efforts, and enhancing AI implementation quality, we worked with other healthcare institutions and participated in industry collaborations.\nTo delve further into specifics, we established three focused groups to refine our guidelines: (1) Fairness and Privacy; (2) Transparency, Accountability, and Benefit; and (3) Robustness and Safety, each group had 4, 7, and 5 expert members respectively These insights were integrated into official guidelines for AI governance, incorporating appropriate considerations across institutional stakeholders (Fig. 1).\nOperationalizing AI deployment guidelines\nFollowing the establishment of comprehensive AI integration guidelines, our focus shifted toward the development and execution of a structured framework to facilitate their application within the healthcare setting. This effort was co-led by the innovation, digital, and data science teams.\nOur AI deployment guidelines had to mirror these teams’ existing protocols yet also consider the unique considerations of AI technologies across the Mass General Brigham (MGB) system. We adapted the standard digital work intake and created a specialized technology assessment tool. Our standard intake process evaluates project alignment with organizational priorities and digital strategy, technical feasibility, resource requirements, and project leadership assignments. The specialized assessment tool was specifically designed to address the distinct aspects of AI applications, such as the datasets employed for training and validation, development methods, performance evaluation metrics, potential risks, limitations, and ongoing monitoring parameters.\nThe preliminary evaluation stage culminates in a consultative session with the respective vendor or research team. This meeting is pivotal, allowing for an in-depth discussion on the proposed metrics, the frequency and nature of model updates, monitoring and the formulation of a strategy for the subsequent shadow deployment phase. The shadow deployment phase allows the AI systems to operate parallel to existing workflows without impacting patient care, allowing for a real-time evaluation and optimization of the technology under actual working conditions.\nFollowing the shadow deployment, our evaluation of AI systems encompasses a range of key metrics, ensuring their efficacy and seamless integration into clinical settings. Among these metrics, we prioritize assessing fairness across patient demographics, collecting provider feedback to gauge user experience, and examining workflow integration and usability to assess scalability, cost-effectiveness, clinical impact, and performance stability over time. These metrics provide a framework for evaluating the AI systems’ effectiveness and practicality in real-world healthcare environments.\nResults\nEstablishing AI integration guidelines in healthcare: outcomes and principles\nThrough this process, we identified key components critical to responsible AI implementation, providing a more detailed analysis than what is available in existing frameworks. (Table 1; Sup 1) Upholding our commitment to fairness, we mandated diverse training datasets as a standard requirement to mitigate bias. Going further would be the evaluation of outcomes with an equity lens, and subsequent model reengineering to ensure equitable outcomes. Equally crucial is the transparent communication of systems’ FDA status, specifying whether FDA approval is required and, if so, its current approval status, to ensure compliance and foster trust.\nOur team is committed to actively monitoring AI systems, promptly addressing performance issues, and ensuring equity, robustness, and accountability. A risk-based approach should be taken to this monitoring, such that those applications that potentially introduce greater risk to care outcomes are monitored more robustly than those with minimal or no risk to clinical outcomes. An AI operations committee is being established to lead and provide oversight to this effort.\nOur aim is to maintain stringent documentation and transparent communication, enabling informed decision-making regarding AI tools in patient care. While autonomous AI enhances administrative efficiency, we currently enforce stringent human oversight in all clinical decision-making processes to help ensure patient safety. Our protocol also mandates intensified monitoring procedures to effectively navigate associated risks and uncertainties, especially for high-risk AI systems, including those utilizing LLMs.\nThe process of establishing these guidelines was not without challenges, as finding common meeting times for all leaders proved difficult. However, forming smaller, specialized groups proved beneficial, allowing leaders with relevant expertise to collaborate effectively. Ultimately, bringing the outcomes back to the larger team was essential, ensuring a unified approach across all departments.\nFramework for AI implementation in healthcare: a case study of ambient documentation\nIn our effort to establish a robust framework for AI implementation across all AI types, we selected generative AI, specifically its application in ambient documentation systems, as a representative case study to illustrate our approach. This choice was driven by the inherent monitoring challenges associated with generative AI technologies. Ambient documentation exemplifies an AI application that records conversations between patients and clinicians to generate draft clinical notes, which clinicians subsequently review and refine before finalizing the medical records.\nWe first implemented a pilot study involving a select group of individuals from various departments.\nIn prioritizing this organization-wide application, we focused on security and privacy, sharing deidentified data with the vendor to enable continuous model updates and improvements. We collaborated closely with the vendor on strict de-identification processes, data retention policies, and the controlled use of data solely for enhancing the model’s performance. Crucially, we prohibited long-term storage and use of recordings because the recordings cannot be de-identified, thereby safeguarding the privacy and security of both patients and clinicians.\nAs an integral component of our transparency and explainability framework, this initial phase allowed for an in-depth assessment of the system’s functionality and the collection of targeted feedback, crucial for identifying potential issues early in the implementation process. We employed a set of metrics for evaluation, including system usage, the percentage of notes retained after edits by clinicians to evaluate clinical impact, and feedback in both numeric and free-text formats to assess performance. These metrics were monitored over time to identify any discernible trends.\nTo ensure accountability, we require that all clinical messages generated by the system be reviewed and edited by clinicians before being sent to patients.\nWhile focusing on patient benefit, we acknowledge the inability to measure quality based on demographics—due to the lack of linkage between these data and electronic health records—our existing metrics have underscored the tool’s capability to be effectively utilized across the entire organization. Recognizing the diversity of our user base, we placed significant emphasis on testing the AI tool across a spectrum of users, including patients and providers, to ensure its robustness irrespective of one’s primary language, accent, or the presence of an interpreter during clinical visits. This testing approach led to the selection of vendors that demonstrated proficiency in drafting clinical visit notes in scenarios involving non-English languages and interpreters.\nDuring the shadow deployment, most users were from the Emergency Medicine and Internal Medicine Departments. There were no specific Feedback trends, but the average scores were mostly in the range of 3–5, with 5 being the best possible score. Most criticisms targeted the documentation of physical examinations, potentially reflecting the less intuitive nature of vocalizing physical exam findings in the presence of a patient compared to the more fluid process of recounting the history of the present illness, which received positive remarks. Furthermore, there were appreciative comments on the system’s efficiency in documenting encounters with patients who have strong accents or with an interpreter present.\nOur next steps will focus on expanding the pilot to include more departments, capturing a wider variety of clinical cases and patient demographics. This expansion is critical to ensure that the AI system’s translation accuracy remains robust across different races, primary languages, ages, and sexes. Additionally, by involving a more diverse group of providers, we aim to account for diversity in medical scenarios and in interview and note-writing styles. This will further enhance the system’s adaptability to varying clinical workflows and provider preferences, ensuring effectiveness across the organization.\nAs we expand, training and support will be critical to help clinicians understand how to effectively integrate this AI tool into their practice. This training will address both technical use and awareness of the system’s limitations, including potential omissions, hallucinations and inaccuracies.\nDiscussion\nThe process of integrating AI into healthcare presents both significant opportunities and challenges. Our initiative builds upon the existing foundation laid by various organizations, focusing on essential principles such as fairness, equity, robustness, privacy, safety, transparency, explainability, and accountability, with an added emphasis on the tangible benefits for patients, healthcare providers, and the organization at large.\nThe establishment of a multidisciplinary committee was a strategic step that facilitated smooth deliberations and decision-making. By aligning core values and priorities from the outset, the committee was able to navigate complex issues effectively. The adoption of a use-case approach for scenarios with ambiguous or conflicting requirements underscores the flexibility and adaptability of our framework. This approach ensures that while maintaining consistency with our core values, we can tailor AI integration to specific contexts, thereby avoiding one-size-fits-all solutions that may not serve the diverse needs of our patient population.\nThe reflective process initiated by our AI integration efforts has broadened our perspective on patient equity and fairness. It has prompted us to reconsider not only AI-related technologies but also other aspects of healthcare provision that may have previously been accepted without sufficient scrutiny for bias or inequity. This introspection is a testament to the transformative potential of AI in catalyzing more equitable healthcare practices.\nOngoing monitoring and reassessment of AI systems are critical, given the dynamic nature of both the technology and the healthcare landscape. Unlike static technologies, AI models evolve based on new data, changing clinical practices, and patient demographics. This evolution necessitates a proactive approach to ensure that AI tools remain effective, ethical, and aligned with our healthcare goals. Collaboration with vendors is essential in this context, as their insights and updates to AI models play a crucial role in maintaining system performance and relevance.\nOur exploration of generative AI in ambient documentation has shed light on the specific challenges associated with monitoring these technologies. Despite the lack of straightforward metrics for performance evaluation, we have developed a framework centered on clinical outcomes and clinician feedback. As we continue to expand AI applications within healthcare, a critical area of focus will be the analysis of performance across different demographics to ensure equity and effectiveness. Engaging a broad spectrum of users in providing feedback will be vital in refining these technologies to meet the diverse needs of the healthcare community effectively. Further, these processes involved considerable manual effort. Automating the collection of key metrics and alerting when metrics change beyond pre-determined points will be important as these tools scale.\nConclusion\nWe have outlined a methodology for integrating AI into healthcare settings, emphasizing the establishment of comprehensive guidelines and operational frameworks applicable across the spectrum of AI tools. Our multidisciplinary approach provides a blueprint for healthcare institutions, non-profit organizations, and governmental agencies seeking to implement and monitor AI technologies responsibly.\nOur case study on ambient documentation, which utilizes generative AI, illustrates the practical application of our framework. While focusing on this specific use case, we described challenges and opportunities common to many AI implementations in healthcare. The case study underscores the importance of continuous monitoring, evaluation, and adaptation of AI systems to maintain their relevance and effectiveness in changing clinical environments. By engaging in proactive dialog with vendors and incorporating diverse clinician and patient feedback, we ensure that AI tools enhance healthcare outcomes while upholding ethical standards.\nThe integration of AI into healthcare is an evolving journey, requiring ongoing commitment to ethical considerations, performance monitoring, and stakeholder engagement. Our report offers a starting point for healthcare institutions to develop and refine their processes for the responsible integration of AI, advocating for a dynamic, responsive approach to AI deployment in healthcare settings. To further this endeavor, our study underscores the importance of fostering cross-institutional and public-private partnerships. These collaborations are envisioned to amplify the impact of our findings, paving the way for wider accessibility of AI technologies. By not requiring each organization to undertake the extensive assessments we conducted, we aim to streamline the adoption process. These strategic alliances will play a crucial role in scaling up AI deployment while maintaining stringent quality and ethical standards.\nAs we move forward, it is imperative that we continue to evaluate and refine these guidelines, ensuring they keep pace with technological advancements and the evolving needs of patients and healthcare providers alike.\nChange history\n30 January 2025\nA Correction to this paper has been published: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41746-025-01445-0\nReferences\nRajpurkar, P. et al.

Image: Unsplash/Accuray\n- Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming healthcare by improving diagnostic accuracy, enabling earlier disease detection and enhancing patient outcomes.\n- Effective and ethical AI solutions in healthcare require collaboration among AI engineers, data scientists, domain experts, and other stakeholders, which results in more effective AI models.\n- AI-driven diagnostics are democratizing healthcare by making early and accurate diagnoses more accessible, especially in regions with limited access to specialized medical professionals.\nThe healthcare sector is poised for a revolution, with artificial intelligence (AI) playing a pivotal role in transforming how we diagnose and treat diseases.\nAI’s ability to process vast amounts of data quickly and accurately is reshaping the landscape, offering new ways to improve health outcomes globally.\nHowever, building effective and accurate solutions that are culturally sensitive and inclusive requires collaboration across the plethora of needed skill sets. The result is better and faster access to health solutions.\nThe promise of AI in healthcare\nAI’s potential in healthcare is vast, ranging from predictive analytics and personalized treatment plans to improving diagnostic accuracy. The sheer volume of medical data generated daily – from patient records, clinical trials, medical imaging and wearable devices – can be overwhelming for human practitioners.\nAs AI can analyze and learn from this data, patterns and correlations that may go unnoticed by human eyes can be detected. This leads to earlier and more accurate diagnoses, which is crucial in improving patient outcomes.\nOne of the most promising areas of AI in healthcare is in diagnostics. Traditional diagnostic methods often rely on the subjective interpretation of medical professionals, which can sometimes result in variability in outcomes. AI can reduce this variability by providing consistent, data-driven insights, leading to more reliable diagnoses.\nCollaboration key to robust AI healthcare\nCollaboration in AI development is essential for creating effective, ethical and impactful solutions to the world’s most pressing challenges, whether that includes AI engineers, data scientists and domain experts. “Such kind of collaboration across people from different sectors and regions help build more ethical and trustworthy AI solutions,” says Rudradeb Mitra, CEO of Omdena, a collaborative AI platform.\nIn the healthcare sector, Omdena applies AI to diagnostic processes, particularly in underserved communities. These models assist medical professionals in identifying diseases more accurately – such as tuberculosis and diabetic retinopathy – and at earlier stages, thereby increasing the chances of successful treatment.\nThese projects involve training AI algorithms on large datasets of medical images. Taking a collaborative approach ensures that the AI models are robust, culturally sensitive and adaptable to various healthcare settings.\nThe World Economic Forum is also driving digital healthcare transformation by fostering a global, multi-stakeholder approach to accelerate the responsible integration of digital health solutions into healthcare systems worldwide.\nBy collaborating with governments, businesses and civil society, the Forum focuses on improving healthcare access, outcomes and equity through innovative technologies while addressing challenges such as data privacy, cybersecurity and ethical use of AI in healthcare.\nBy integrating AI models into healthcare systems, particularly in regions with limited access to specialized medical professionals, we can democratize healthcare and ensure that more people have access to early and accurate diagnoses.\nImpact on health outcomes\nEarly diagnosis is often the key to successful treatment. Diseases like cancer, for example, have a significantly higher survival rate when detected early. When breast cancer is detected at stage one, the five-year survival rate is over 90%. Colorectal cancer yields a 14% five-year survival rate when diagnosed in later stages but can be around 90% with early diagnosis. Therefore, the impact of AI-driven diagnostics on health outcomes cannot be overstated.\n“This not only improves patient outcomes but also makes healthcare more accessible to all and reduces the burden on healthcare systems by preventing the progression of diseases to more advanced stages, which are often more difficult and expensive to treat,” says Mitra.\nFor example, Omdena's AI-powered app in Liberia predicts malaria outbreaks and identifies high-risk areas, enabling health officials to take proactive measures, particularly for vulnerable groups such as children and pregnant women.\nAI is also transforming oncology by enabling personalized cancer treatments through genomic analysis, identifying mutations and tailoring therapies to a patient's unique cancer profile. This approach improves treatment efficacy, reduces side effects and accelerates drug discovery.\nAI has also been used in the early detection and prediction of cardiovascular diseases. Machine learning is used to analyse ECGs, medical imaging, and patient data. With studies having shown impressive accuracy rates, including of heart disease classification of 93%, AI is improving diagnostics and offering noninvasive methods for assessing cardiovascular risks, potentially saving lives.\nThe future of AI in healthcare\nAs AI continues to evolve, its role in healthcare will only become more critical.

A new collaboration with the Mayo Clinic brings physician team — and married couple — Chieh-Ju Chao and Chia-Chun Chiang to the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI (HAI) to learn how to bridge the gap.\nImproving Treatment for Migraine Patients\nAt the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, Chia-Chun Chiang splits her medical practice between treating patients who’ve suffered acute stroke and migraine sufferers who come to her to seek help with the intense headaches that can sometimes incapacitate them for weeks, months, or longer. Chiang, a specialist in headache medicine and vascular neurology, not only hopes to improve these daily realities for her patients but also wants to explore how AI may someday lead to better overall treatment through exciting new breakthroughs.\nFor the next year, Chiang will be a visiting scholar at Stanford HAI, where she’s exploring the intersection of AI and neurology. The appointment is part of a new collaborative program between HAI and the Mayo Clinic and will give Chiang a chance to do what she’s always loved — find innovative solutions to challenging medical questions.\nBorn in Taiwan, Chiang found her medical horizons were expanded early in her career, both by her neurosurgeon father and a series of influential mentors on two continents.\n“My father always encouraged me to think not just about day-to-day realities in medical practice but about making research breakthroughs in medicine — about discovery,” she says. “Arthur Chiou, a professor of biophotonics at National Yang Ming University, opened a window for me to see different types of medical research. Later, I came to the University of California, San Diego, and met Professor Shu Chien in the department of bioengineering. He got me into the world of using math and physics to solve medical research problems. It was inspiring.”\nChiang’s time at Stanford HAI will be spent on several research projects focusing on her special interest in migraine and stroke. She hopes to use AI to help doctors determine which of many preventive migraine medications might help chronic migraine sufferers — those experiencing migraine attacks more than 15 days per month — stave off debilitating attacks.\n“Right now there’s no way to predict if a patient will respond to medication A, B, C, D, or E,” she says. “It’s a trial-and-error process, where we start with one medication and wait three months to see if it helps. This can be a long time and a long process when you’re in pain. I’m hoping to be able to apply advanced machine learning technologies to the Mayo Clinic’s established headache database to help predict good matches or to develop personalized treatment plans for patients with migraine.”\nChiang is also collaborating with Nigam Shah, a Stanford professor of medicine and chief data scientist for Stanford Health Care, to be able to more effectively utilize all of a patient’s electronic health record data to understand which migraine patients might be at risk of stroke and cardiovascular disease.\n“Things like clinician notes, consultations, and admission notes are written in free text, which traditionally have been hard for data scientists to access,” she says. “Dr. Shah’s lab has developed several advanced machine learning tools tailored to health care notes that can extract and use this sort of information. We hope to be able to apply these tools to databases at the Mayo Clinic and at Stanford to give us some solid research results from two different health care systems.”\nChiang says AI is changing the field of neurology through innovations such as telemedicine and AI-assisted CT analysis, both of which benefit stroke patients, particularly those in isolated regions of the country where small hospitals may not have neurologists on staff. Continuing the introduction of relevant and user-friendly technology into health care, however, will require improved communication between those who develop AI and those who treat patients.\n“I’m very excited about the use of AI in my field, which is why I wanted to come to HAI and contribute to this process by stimulating more discussion and work between data scientists and clinicians,” she says. “I see patients who are suffering every day in clinic. It’s crucial for us to continue imagining how AI tools can be developed to improve their quality of life.”\nDeveloping Better Tools for Echocardiography\nMayo Clinic cardiologist Chieh-Ju Chao was a teenager in Taiwan when the college entrance exam set him on a trajectory to medical school. Deep down, though, the 18-year-old harbored a secret ambition.\n“I was happy to go into medicine, but I always loved physics,” he says. “It was always in the back of my mind. I love the beauty of the laws and formulas in physics and, as a kid, I dreamed of being the next Einstein or Feynman.” After medical school, Chao took postgraduate physics courses in Taiwan before becoming a postdoctoral fellow at UC San Diego, where he led a research project to build a 3D dynamic heart model. He began to see intersections between physics and medicine, particularly in the field of cardiology. “It was one of the most important periods of my life and one that really changed my career path,” he says.\nFor the next year, Chao will have a chance to deeply explore his interdisciplinary interests, as a visiting scholar at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence. As part of a collaborative program between Stanford HAI and the Mayo Clinic, facilitated and guided by HAI Co-Director Fei-Fei Li, Chao will expand his current research on the potential use of AI technology to augment echocardiography, which harnesses ultrasound waves to examine the anatomy and dynamics of the heart. Chao hopes his dual background in medicine and technology will allow him to bridge the knowledge gap that often exists between health care and technology professionals and to accelerate the expansion of AI systems into clinical medicine at the Mayo Clinic and elsewhere.\n“The usual pathway for this has always been for clinicians to come up with an idea, then talk to AI engineers,” he says. “But that process can take a long time because communication between the two disciplines is not easy. For the first time, this program between Mayo and HAI sends clinicians out into the AI field to learn some of these skills and take them back. I knew this was something I wanted to do. I see myself as a person who will be able to speak both languages.”\nAt the Mayo Clinic, Chao studies how AI models might be used to solve clinical questions, such as how to classify different grades of cardiac diastolic dysfunction, which occur when the heart’s damaged ventricles are unable to completely fill with blood. (That work, in fact, resulted in Chao being named a “Young Investigator Award” finalist at the 2022 American College of Cardiology Conference.)\nAt Stanford HAI, he’ll focus on two primary research projects. The first will incorporate the use of AI to give cardiologists a more realistic view of the heart during procedures such as aortic and mitral valve replacements, which are often done with the use of catheters rather than open-heart surgery. Positioning these catheters currently relies on the 2D images provided by echocardiogram and X-ray. Chao envisions AI models that might be able to compile that information with CT images of the patient’s heart, giving doctors a real-time 3D and even hologram-based picture that would make the procedure smoother and more efficient.\n“Our goal is to improve success rates, minimize complications, and lessen radiation exposure through shorter procedures,” Chao says. “It could potentially shorten procedure times from five or six hours to two or three and allow a more efficient use of our procedure room resources.”\nSecondly, Chao will explore the potential use of AI visual linguistic models to generate time-consuming echocardiography reports more efficiently. Ideally, the model would have the capacity to do an initial interpretation of the study and generate a preliminary report that could then be reviewed by clinicians.\n“This would be an advancement in current AI application in the medical field,” Chao says. “People have been trying to create systems that can report on chest X-rays, which are a single image. In an echo study, we’re dealing with video clips that record the cardiac dynamics from different views. It’s an even more exciting challenge.”\nChao says he’s motivated both by colleagues at the Mayo Clinic who are enthusiastic about this work as well as the range of scholars and technical resources he’s finding at Stanford HAI.\n“It’s amazing to work with cutting-edge AI scientists and the latest technology,” he says. “Talking about my clinical ideas with colleagues here in this setting is a very different and immersive learning experience for me, and these conversations are generating new ideas as I learn about what people are doing here and about potential applications I hadn’t thought about. It’s all really exciting.”\nStanford HAI’s mission is to advance AI research, education, policy and practice to improve the human condition.

In addition, strong performance requires models to move beyond short passages of text to understand complex multimodal data, including images, videos, and the extensive length and breadth of electronic health records (EHRs). With this in mind, Gemini models have demonstrated a leap forward in multimodal and long-context reasoning, which presents substantial potential in medicine.\nToday we present two recent research papers in which we explore the possibilities of Gemini in the healthcare space and introduce Med-Gemini, a new family of next-generation models fine-tuned for the medical domain. This family of models builds upon Google’s Gemini models by fine-tuning on de-identified medical data while inheriting Gemini’s native reasoning, multimodal, and long-context abilities. Med-Gemini builds on our initial research into medically tuned large language models with Med-PaLM.\nThe first paper, “Capabilities of Gemini Models in Medicine”, describes a broad exploration of Gemini’s capabilities across a wide range of text, image, video, and EHR tasks. We benchmark the new Med-Gemini models on 14 tasks spanning text, multimodal and long-context applications, and demonstrate strong results, including a new state-of-the-art of 91.1% accuracy for the popular MedQA benchmark.\nIn the second paper, “Advancing Multimodal Medical Capabilities of Gemini”, we offer a deeper dive into Med-Gemini’s multimodal capabilities through application to radiology, pathology, dermatology, ophthalmology, and genomics in healthcare. We focus on clinical applicability, improving benchmarks, and leveraging specialist evaluations to assess the models’ capabilities. For the first time, we demonstrate how large multimodal models can interpret complex 3D scans, answer clinical questions, and generate state-of-the-art radiology reports. Additionally, we demonstrate a novel mechanism to encode genomic information for risk prediction using large language models across a wealth of disease areas with strong results.\nThe broad capabilities of Gemini models in medicine\nIn “Capabilities of Gemini Models in Medicine”, we enhance our models’ clinical reasoning capabilities through self-training and web search integration, while improving multimodal performance through fine-tuning and customized encoders.\nWe then benchmark Med-Gemini models on 14 tasks spanning text, multimodal and long-context applications. In the popular MedQA US Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE)-style question benchmark, Med-Gemini achieves a state-of-the-art performance of 91.1% accuracy, surpassing our prior best of Med-PaLM 2 by 4.6% (shown below). We conducted a careful inspection of the MedQA benchmark with expert clinicians, and found that 7.4% of the questions were deemed unfit for evaluation as they either lacked key information or supported multiple plausible interpretations. We account for these data quality issues to more precisely characterize the performance of our model.\nOur approach utilizes uncertainty-guided web search to enable the model to use accurate and up-to-date information. This approach generalizes to achieve state-of-the-art performance in other challenging benchmarks, including complex diagnostic challenges from NEJM clinico-pathological conferences.\nOn multimodal benchmarks such as NEJM Image Challenges and multimodal USMLE-style questions, Med-Gemini achieves a new state of the art, surpassing GPT-4 V by a wide margin. We demonstrate the effectiveness of long-context capabilities through medical video and EHR question answering on which Med-Gemini surpasses prior bespoke methods in a zero-shot manner. In order to assess performance on common text-based tasks, we evaluated performance on medical text summarization and simplification of referral letter generation, finding that Med-Gemini–produced drafts were preferred to those of clinicians for succinctness, coherence, and in some cases also for accuracy. In multiple qualitative examples, we demonstrate the clear potential for Med-Gemini to provide accurate and useful conversation about multimodal artifacts such as medical imaging (dermatology or radiology) or long multimodal research articles.\nIn this safety-critical domain, considerable further research is needed before real-world application can be considered. For example, additional research and evaluations on potential biases, safety, and reliability are essential to ensure building safe applications. These systems should also be thoroughly evaluated not just in isolation, but with human experts in the loop.\nAdvancing multimodal medical capabilities\nOur second piece of research, “Advancing Multimodal Medical Capabilities of Gemini”, expands on our multimodal medical large language model work from 2023 by diving deeper into multimodal capabilities made possible by the Gemini family of models. We focus on tuning for radiology, pathology, dermatology, ophthalmology, and genomics applications in healthcare via Med-Gemini-2D, Med-Gemini-3D, and Med-Gemini-Polygenic.\nTrained on a range of conventional 2D medical images (chest X-rays, CT slices, pathology slides, etc) using de-identified medical data with free text labels, Med-Gemini-2D is able to perform a number of tasks, such as classification, visual question answering, and text generation. One example includes report generation for chest X-rays, which was shown to exceed previous state-of-the-art results by up to 12% across normal and abnormal scans from two separate datasets.\nMed-Gemini-3D can also understand and write radiology reports for 3D studies like computed tomography (CT) imaging of the head (example shown below). Volumetric, 3D scans are an essential tool in modern medicine, providing more context for countless diagnostic and treatment decisions requiring an understanding of 3D anatomy. Technically, 3D reflects a meaningful jump in multimodal clinical task complexity when compared to 2D. Additionally, in evaluation of the reports generated by Med-Gemini-3D, more than half were determined to result in the same care recommendations made by a radiologist. However, additional real-world research and validation is needed to ensure consistent expert reporting quality.\nBeyond report generation, Med-Gemini-2D also achieves a new state-of-the-art for chest X-ray visual question answering, and performs well across a range of classification tasks across histopathology, ophthalmology, dermatology, and radiology, approaching the performance of task-specific models.\nBeyond imaging, our new Med-Gemini-Polygenic research model is the first language model to perform disease and health outcome prediction from genomic data. The model outperforms previous linear polygenic scores for prediction of eight health outcomes (depression, stroke, glaucoma, rheumatoid arthritis, all cause mortality, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), type 2 diabetes) and is surprisingly able to predict an additional six health outcomes for which it had not explicitly been trained. Based on this performance, we believe the model is able to leverage intrinsic knowledge about genetic correlation for predicting health outcomes.\nEvaluation is an increasingly critical piece of research in this domain. In this work the team explores both benchmarks and other objective measures for classification and closed-ended questions (e.g., yes/no or limited choice formats) as well as specialist panel-based assessments for text generation and open-ended questions. For the former, the field has relied on traditional benchmarks to provide objective measures of progress, and we use many of them in our research today. For the latter, we believe evaluation is still in its infancy and will benefit from more input across a broad range of health professions.\nConclusion\nOur research provides a glimpse of an exciting future where AI can broadly and deeply contribute to the medical domain. Med-Gemini demonstrates powerful multimodal capabilities that have the potential to assist in clinician, researcher, and patient workflows. While our findings are promising, and provide a step forward in the potential of AI models in medicine, it is important for these methods to be thoroughly tested in a variety of settings beyond traditional benchmarks. This is an essential step to ensure models like these are safe and reliable before being deployed in real-world situations involving patients or other users.\nWe’re excited about the potential of Med-Gemini in the medical domain and believe the broader researcher and developer community can play a role in continuing to improve the model’s safety and reliability, while also helping us better understand novel use cases. While Med-Gemini is not a product offering available for commercial use, one of the next steps is to explore its capabilities through collaboration with Google Cloud healthcare and life science customers and researchers.

Typically, this entails exciting conversations around Google’s mobile platform, Android, or the newest hardware the company is planning to release. However, this year, something else stole the show: Google’s incredible progress in artificial intelligence (AI).\nAI has been all the buzz in both Silicon Valley and around the world for the last few months, especially after the release of Chat-GPT and advanced generative AI systems. This has triggered somewhat of a frantic rat-race amongst tech giants: everyone wants a piece of the AI pie, and the race to the top is intense.\nFor example, Microsoft is investing significant resources into its AI capabilities, relentlessly trying to integrate the technology across a variety of sectors, ranging from manufacturing to healthcare. Amazon is also innovating in this space, offering customers turn-key services to build their own machine learning and AI models.\nIn a similar fashion, Google has made incredible strides in its own AI journey. Though many may suspect that the buzz around AI is relatively new, the company has actually been setting the foundation for advanced language models and usable AI for many years. This work has culminated in products with incredible potential, including PaLM 2, Google’s latest generation large language model.\nAs an introduction to PaLM 2, Zoubin Ghahramani, Vice President of Google DeepMind, wrote last week: “today we’re introducing PaLM 2, our next generation language model. PaLM 2 is a state-of-the-art language model with improved multilingual, reasoning and coding capabilities.” He goes on to describe these capabilities further, discussing how PaLM 2 is trained across 100 languages, has a higher capability for common sense reasoning and advanced mathematics and logic, and can even generate advanced code.\nNotably, Ghahramani also discusses one of the most highly anticipated arenas of impact for AI: healthcare. He delves into Med-PaLM 2, the large language model developed specifically to generate medical insights: “trained by our health research teams with medical knowledge, [Med-PaLM 2] can answer questions and summarize insights from a variety of dense medical texts. It achieves state-of-the-art results in medical competency, and was the first large language model to perform at “expert” level on U.S. Medical Licensing Exam-style [USMLE] questions. We're now adding multimodal capabilities to synthesize information like x-rays and mammograms to one day improve patient outcomes. Med-PaLM 2 will open up to a small group of Cloud customers for feedback later this summer to identify safe, helpful use cases.”\nThe full 2023 keynote can be viewed here:\nGoogle Cloud, especially for Healthcare, has been incredibly successful over the last few years. For example, Google Cloud’s Healthcare Data Engine is an industry-leading platform to optimize interoperability in healthcare, which could resolve some of the sector’s most challenging problems: significant data-fragmentation, lack of cohesive insights, and splintered patient journeys.\nGoogle Cloud’s Global Director of Healthcare Strategy & Solutions, Aashima Gupta, and Global Director of Health Plan Strategy & Solutions, Amy Waldron, explain: “Industry-tailored LLMs like Med-PaLM 2 are part of a burgeoning family of generative AI technologies that have the potential to significantly enhance healthcare experiences. We’re looking forward to working with our customers to understand how Med-PaLM 2 might be used to facilitate rich, informative discussions, answer complex medical questions, and find insights in complicated and unstructured medical texts. They might also explore its utility to help draft short- and long-form responses and summarize documentation and insights from internal data sets and bodies of scientific knowledge.”\nThe Cloud team was also responsible for launching the Medical Imaging Suite, a comprehensive AI platform to make medical imaging data “accessible, interoperable, and useful.”\nUndoubtedly, the development of PaLM 2 will be a gamechanger for healthcare. Whether it be used to conduct advanced analytics of vast amounts of public health or patient data, or simply as a means to better triage and improve physician workflows, the technology has immense potential to create tangible impact.\nEspecially with regards to synthesis and insight generation, this technology may be immensely useful for organizations that want to scale their tactical approach to improving patient outcomes. For example, for public entities, harnessing this technology may one day make possible the ingestion of terabytes of public health data that is otherwise unstructured to generate usable insights. For private organizations, this technology could prove to be a significant boon in the realms of interoperability, improving patient journeys, and succeeding in true longitudinal care.\nNevertheless, this technology requires guardrails. While there is significant potential for beneficial use, there is also some “fear of the unknown.” That is, in the wrong hands, the powerful technology that drives these advancements in AI can have negative repercussions. This is a prime reason why the developer conference had an entire segment dedicated to the “responsible development” of AI, serving as a reminder of the checks and balances needed in this rapidly growing arena of technology. Nonetheless, if developers and innovators are able to create and harness this technology in a safe and sustainable manner, it may potentially change the face of healthcare delivery for generations to come.", "select_response": "<think>\nThe purpose of the current search round is to address specific information gaps related to AI in healthcare, particularly with regard to case studies, cost-effectiveness data, patient satisfaction metrics, comparative studies, failure cases, and treatment planning protocols.

With a strategic approach and a commitment to responsible innovation, Mayo Clinic is setting a new benchmark for how AI can enhance patient care and streamline medical workflows.\nKey speakers\n- Moderator: Gabriel Perna, Modern Healthcare’s Digital Health Editor\n- Speaker: Cris Ross, Mayo Clinic’s Former CIO\nThese insights came from our ScaleUp:AI event in November 2024, an industry-leading global conference that features topics across technologies and industries. Watch the full session below:\nKey takeaways\n- Workforce shortages: AI can help alleviate the strain by automating tasks and improving efficiency.\n- Data complexity: Healthcare generates about 30% of the world’s data, growing at an annual rate of 36%. AI helps structure this data for quality management, reimbursement, and research.\n- Patient experience: AI tools are being deployed to improve patient interactions, such as summarizing doctor visits for stressed patients who might struggle to retain information.\n- Access, affordability, and quality: AI can optimize medical workflows, reducing avoidable medical injuries and improving treatment quality.\n- Cures for complex diseases: AI is already making strides in accelerating diagnostics and treatment strategies for conditions such as atrial fibrillation and cancer.\nAddressing healthcare challenges with AI\nWorkforce shortages and data complexity\nThe healthcare industry is facing a generational shortage of professionals, which poses significant challenges for patient care. Ross emphasized that AI can help bridge this gap by taking on administrative and repetitive tasks, allowing medical professionals to focus on patient interactions and complex decision-making.\n“We have a generational shortage of healthcare professionals.”\n“We have a generational shortage of healthcare professionals,” Ross explained. “AI has some challenges in other industries from an ethical perspective on reduction in jobs, but look, if it can do the jobs of people in healthcare, it’s a hero job.”\nAt the same time, healthcare is one of the most data-intensive industries, with an estimated 30% of the world’s healthcare-related data. This data grows at a staggering 36% annual rate, presenting both challenges and opportunities for AI.\n“Doctors want to have conversations with patients,” Ross said. “So what can we do to improve the patient experience by using AI tools to be explainers, so patients can ask questions of a record and have a computer answer in a sensible way, where doctors don’t have time to answer those questions.”\nEnhancing patient experience and healthcare accessibility\nThe stress and confusion that often accompany medical visits make it difficult for patients to absorb and retain crucial health information. AI tools can improve patient experiences by summarizing doctor visits and providing personalized explanations.\nAdditionally, quality healthcare remains out of reach for many due to accessibility and affordability issues. AI is being used to improve workflow efficiencies, streamline diagnoses, and enhance decision-making to reduce costs and increase care quality.\n“We still have tens of thousands of people who are injured every year in the U.S. from medical injury that’s avoidable. So there’s all sorts of things we can do to improve.” Ross noted. AI can help reduce these errors, ensure more efficient triage, and make scheduling and operational management more effective.\nAdvancing treatments and accelerating disease detection\nAI is accelerating disease detection and treatment breakthroughs, particularly in areas like arrhythmia detection, cancer treatment, and transplant matching.\n“Some of the stuff that we’ve done in Mayo is, for instance, detection of arrhythmias,” Ross explained. “We’re at the point where the rhythms can be detected on a single lead ECG, meaning something that can be in an Apple watch or some other device. From that, we can both diagnose arrhythmias and treat them. So when a patient goes into arrhythmia, you can take interventions to get them back into rhythm.”\nHe also highlighted Mayo Clinic’s work with Google on radiotherapy optimization: “We worked with Google to develop algorithms to do better radiotherapy treatment of disease, and we started with head and neck cancers.” With AI-powered radiotherapy, AI can maximize tumor targeting while minimizing damage to surrounding tissue, potentially transforming cancer treatment outcomes.\nAI at scale: Mayo Clinic’s enterprise-wide approach\nUnlike many healthcare institutions that focus on isolated AI projects, Mayo Clinic has developed an enterprise-wide AI strategy:\nData consolidation: Over a decade, Mayo Clinic unified its electronic health records into a single system, creating a comprehensive, structured patient database.\nAI factory: Hosted on Google Cloud’s Vertex AI, Mayo Clinic’s AI factory supports over 250 AI research and deployment projects, integrating models with real-time patient data.\nCloud app factory: Ensuring AI models can be deployed efficiently within workflows, bridging the gap between innovation and clinical application.\n“We have two jobs: One is to support technology for the world’s best hospital. The second is to innovate at Silicon Valley speed and put solutions into production.”\n“We have two jobs,” Ross explained. “One is to support technology for the world’s best hospital. The second is to innovate at Silicon Valley speed and put solutions into production.”\n“We need to go as fast as we can, but no faster than is safe”\nAs AI adoption grows, Ross urged the industry to focus on the five core challenges he outlined. Looking ahead, he sees a future where startups, research institutions, and cloud platforms collaborate to create transformative healthcare solutions.\n“We need to go as fast as we can, but no faster than is safe,” he concluded, reinforcing the importance of responsible AI deployment in healthcare.\nWith AI-driven solutions already improving diagnosis, treatment, and patient care, Mayo Clinic’s work serves as a blueprint for the future of AI in medicine.\nWatch more sessions from ScaleUp:AI, and see scaleup.events for updates on ScaleUp:AI 2025.", "select_response": "<think>\nThe purpose of the search round is to gather information regarding specific case studies from major healthcare institutions (like the Mayo Clinic), detailed cost-effectiveness data, ROI statistics, patient satisfaction metrics with AI-assisted care, comparative studies between traditional vs AI-assisted healthcare delivery, recent failure cases or limitations, and detailed treatment planning protocols and success rates. \n\nThe webpage focuses on the Mayo Clinic's application of AI in healthcare, covering how AI is improving patient care, streamlining medical workflows, and addressing workforce shortages and data complexities.

Last year at Google Health’s …", "content": "Snippet: Take a look at our progress on generative AI efforts in health, including product updates and new research. Last year at Google Health’s …\nContent: Our progress on generative AI in health\nLast year at Google Health’s Check Up event, we introduced Med-PaLM 2, our large language model (LLM) fine-tuned for healthcare. Since introducing that research, the model has become available to a set of global customer and partner organizations that are building solutions for a range of uses — including streamlining nurse handoffs and supporting clinicians’ documentation. At the end of last year, we introduced MedLM, a family of foundation models for healthcare built on Med-PaLM 2, and made it more broadly available through Google Cloud’s Vertex AI platform.\nSince then, our work on generative AI for healthcare has progressed — from the new ways we’re training our health AI models to our latest research on applying AI to the healthcare industry.\nNew modalities in models for healthcare\nMedicine is a multimodal discipline; it’s made up of different types of information stored across formats — like radiology images, lab results, genomics data, environmental context and more. To get a fuller understanding of a person’s health, we need to build technology that understands all of this information.\nWe’re bringing new capabilities to our models with the hope of making generative AI more helpful to healthcare organizations and people’s health. We just introduced MedLM for Chest X-ray, which has the potential to help transform radiology workflows by helping with the classification of chest X-rays for a variety of use cases. We’re starting with Chest X-rays because they are critical in detecting lung and heart conditions. MedLM for Chest X-ray is now available to trusted testers in an experimental preview on Google Cloud.\nResearch on fine-tuning our models for the medical domain\nApproximately 30% of the world’s data volume is being generated by the healthcare industry - and is growing at 36% annually. This includes large quantities of text, images, audio, and video. And further, important information about patients' histories is often buried deep in a medical record, making it difficult to find relevant information quickly.\nFor these reasons, we’re researching how a version of the Gemini model, fine-tuned for the medical domain, can unlock new capabilities for advanced reasoning, understanding a high volume of context, and processing multiple modalities. Our latest research resulted in state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark for the U.S. Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE)-style questions at 91.1%, and on a video dataset called MedVidQA.\nAnd because our Gemini models are multimodal, we were able to apply this fine-tuned model to other clinical benchmarks — including answering questions about chest X-ray images and genomics information. We’re also seeing promising results from our fine-tuned models on complex tasks such as report generation for 2D images like X-rays, as well as 3D images like brain CT scans – representing a step-change in our medical AI capabilities. While this work is still in the research phase, there’s potential for generative AI in radiology to bring assistive capabilities to health organizations.\nA Personal Health LLM for personalized coaching and recommendations\nFitbit and Google Research are working together to build a Personal Health Large Language Model that can power personalized health and wellness features in the Fitbit mobile app, helping people get even more insights and recommendations from the data from their Fitbit and Pixel devices. This model is being fine-tuned to deliver personalized coaching capabilities, like actionable messages and guidance, that can be individualized based on personal health and fitness goals. For example, this model may be able to analyze variations in your sleep patterns and sleep quality, and then suggest recommendations on how you might change the intensity of your workout based on those insights.\nThis model is being built on Gemini models and fine-tuned on a de-identified, diverse set of health signals from high-quality research case studies. The studies are being collected and validated in partnership with accredited coaches and wellness experts, enabling the model to exhibit profound reasoning capabilities on physiological and behavioral data. For example, we’re testing performance using sleep medicine certification exam-like practice tests, and are already seeing that our model currently performs well. We'll continue to iterate and learn as we build this new Personal Health Large Language Model, and will share more research soon.\nBetter understanding the assistive capabilities of AI\nGenerative AI is already working as an assistive tool for clinicians, helping them with administrative tasks like documentation that typically takes up hours of time. We’re not stopping there – we’re now building on our work with partners to explore what’s possible.\nEarlier this year, we introduced AMIE (Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer), a research AI system built on a LLM and optimized for diagnostic reasoning and clinical conversations. We explored the performance of a LLM by simulating text-based consultations with patient actors, adapting a well-known framework of “Objective Structured Clinical Examinations” to a consumer-facing user interface. In a randomized comparison with real primary care clinicians performing the same simulated text consultations, appropriately trained LLM rated higher than or on par with these consultations when measured for traits like diagnostic accuracy, empathy and helpful explanation.\nOur next step is to test this with a healthcare organization to see how a LLM like AMIE can be helpful in supporting clinical conversations. We hope to learn how clinicians and patients perceive its use within the care experience with oversight from medical professionals.\nHealthcare presents some of society’s most complex challenges.

The move marks Google's latest attempt to monetize health-care industry AI tools, as competition for market...\nContent: Google on Wednesday announced MedLM, a suite of new health-care-specific artificial intelligence models designed to help clinicians and researchers carry out complex studies, summarize doctor-patient interactions and more.\nThe move marks Google's latest attempt to monetize health-care industry AI tools, as competition for market share remains fierce between competitors like Amazon and Microsoft. CNBC spoke with companies that have been testing Google's technology, like HCA Healthcare, and experts say the potential for impact is real, though they are taking steps to implement it carefully.\nThe MedLM suite includes a large and a medium-sized AI model, both built on Med-PaLM 2, a large language model trained on medical data that Google first announced in March. It is generally available to eligible Google Cloud customers in the U.S. starting Wednesday, and Google said while the cost of the AI suite varies depending on how companies use the different models, the medium-sized model is less expensive to run.\nGoogle said it also plans to introduce health-care-specific versions of Gemini, the company's newest and \"most capable\" AI model, to MedLM in the future.\nAashima Gupta, Google Cloud's global director of health-care strategy and solutions, said the company found that different medically tuned AI models can carry out certain tasks better than others. That's why Google decided to introduce a suite of models instead of trying to build a \"one-size-fits-all\" solution.\nFor instance, Google said its larger MedLM model is better for carrying out complicated tasks that require deep knowledge and lots of compute power, such as conducting a study using data from a health-care organization's entire patient population. But if companies need a more agile model that can be optimized for specific or real-time functions, such as summarizing an interaction between a doctor and patient, the medium-sized model should work better, according to Gupta.\nReal-world use cases\nWhen Google announced Med-PaLM 2 in March, the company initially said it could be used to answer questions like \"What are the first warning signs of pneumonia?\" and \"Can incontinence be cured?\" But as the company has tested the technology with customers, the use cases have changed, according to Greg Corrado, head of Google's health AI.\nCorrado said clinicians don't often need help with \"accessible\" questions about the nature of a disease, so Google hasn't seen much demand for those capabilities from customers. Instead, health organizations often want AI to help solve more back-office or logistical problems, like managing paperwork.\n\"They want something that's helping them with the real pain points and slowdowns that are in their workflow, that only they know,\" Corrado told CNBC.\nFor instance, HCA Healthcare, one of the largest health systems in the U.S., has been testing Google's AI technology since the spring. The company announced an official collaboration with Google Cloud in August that aims to use its generative AI to \"improve workflows on time-consuming tasks.\"\nDr. Michael Schlosser, senior vice president of care transformation and innovation at HCA, said the company has been using MedLM to help emergency medicine physicians automatically document their interactions with patients. For instance, HCA uses an ambient speech documentation system from a company called Augmedix to transcribe doctor-patient meetings. Google's MedLM suite can then take those transcripts and break them up into the components of an ER provider note.\nSchlosser said HCA has been using MedLM within emergency rooms at four hospitals, and the company wants to expand use over the next year. By January, Schlosser added, he expects Google's technology will be able to successfully generate more than half of a note without help from providers. For doctors who can spend up to four hours a day on clerical paperwork, Schlosser said saving that time and effort makes a meaningful difference.\n\"That's been a huge leap forward for us,\" Schlosser told CNBC. \"We now think we're going to be at a point where the AI, by itself, can create 60-plus percent of the note correctly on its own before we have the human doing the review and the editing.\"\nSchlosser said HCA is also working to use MedLM to develop a handoff tool for nurses. The tool can read through the electronic health record and identify relevant information for nurses to pass along to the next shift.\nHandoffs are \"laborious\" and a real pain point for nurses, so it would be \"powerful\" to automate the process, Schlosser said. Nurses across HCA's hospitals carry out around 400,000 handoffs a week, and two HCA hospitals have been testing the nurse handoff tool. Schlosser said nurses conduct a side-by-side comparison of a traditional handoff and an AI-generated handoff and provide feedback.\nWith both use cases, though, HCA has found that MedLM is not foolproof.\nSchlosser said the fact that AI models can spit out incorrect information is a big challenge, and HCA has been working with Google to come up with best practices to minimize those fabrications. He added that token limits, which restrict the amount of data that can be fed to the model, and managing the AI over time have been additional challenges for HCA.\n\"What I would say right now, is that the hype around the current use of these AI models in health care is outstripping the reality,\" Schlosser said. \"Everyone's contending with this problem, and no one has really let these models loose in a scaled way in the health-care systems because of that.\"\nEven so, Schlosser said providers' initial response to MedLM has been positive, and they recognize that they are not working with the finished product yet. He said HCA is working hard to implement the technology in a responsible way to avoid putting patients at risk.\n\"We're being very cautious with how we approach these AI models,\" he said. \"We're not using those use cases where the model outputs can somehow affect someone's diagnosis and treatment.\"\nGoogle also plans to introduce health-care-specific versions of Gemini to MedLM in the future. Its shares popped 5% after Gemini's launch earlier this month, but Google faced scrutiny over its demonstration video, which was not conducted in real time, the company confirmed to Bloomberg.\nIn a statement, Google told CNBC: \"The video is an illustrative depiction of the possibilities of interacting with Gemini, based on real multimodal prompts and outputs from testing. We look forward to seeing what people create when access to Gemini Pro opens on December 13.\"\nCorrado and Gupta of Google said Gemini is still in early stages, and it needs to be tested and evaluated with customers in controlled health-care settings before the model rolls out through MedLM more broadly.\n\"We've been testing Med-PaLM 2 with our customers for months, and now we're comfortable taking that as part of MedLM,\" Gupta said. \"Gemini will follow the same thing.\"\nSchlosser said HCA is \"very excited\" about Gemini, and the company is already working out plans to test the technology, \"We think that may give us an additional level of performance when we get that,\" he said.\nAnother company that has been using MedLM is BenchSci, which aims to use AI to solve problems in drug discovery. Google is an investor in BenchSci, and the company has been testing its MedLM technology for a few months.\nLiran Belenzon, BenchSci's co-founder and CEO, said the company has merged MedLM's AI with BenchSci's own technology to help scientists identify biomarkers, which are key to understanding how a disease progresses and how it can be cured.\nBelenzon said the company spent a lot of time testing and validating the model, including providing Google with feedback about necessary improvements. Now, Belenzon said BenchSci is in the process of bringing the technology to market more broadly.\n\"[MedLM] doesn't work out of the box, but it helps accelerate your specific efforts,\" he told CNBC in an interview.\nCorrado said research around MedLM is ongoing, and he thinks Google Cloud's health-care customers will be able to tune models for multiple different use cases within an organization. He added that Google will continue to develop domain-specific models that are \"smaller, cheaper, faster, better.\"\nLike BenchSci, Deloitte tested MedLM \"over and over\" before deploying the technology to health-care clients, said Dr. Kulleni Gebreyes, Deloitte's U.S. life sciences and health-care consulting leader.\nDeloitte is using Google's technology to help health systems and health plans answer members' questions about accessing care. If a patient needs a colonoscopy, for instance, they can use MedLM to look for providers based on gender, location or benefit coverage, as well as other qualifiers.\nGebreyes said clients have found that MedLM is accurate and efficient, but, like other models, the AI is not always great at deciphering a user's intent. It can be a challenge if patients don't know the right word or spelling for colonoscopy, or use other colloquial terms, she said.\n\"Ultimately, this does not substitute a diagnosis from a trained professional,\" Gebreyes told CNBC. \"It brings expertise closer and makes it more accessible.\"", "select_response": "<think>\nThe purpose of the search round is focused on obtaining specific case studies from major healthcare institutions, detailed cost-effectiveness data, ROI statistics, patient satisfaction metrics, comparative studies on traditional versus AI-assisted healthcare delivery, recent failure cases or limitations, and treatment planning protocols with success rates.

A new collaboration with the Mayo Clinic brings physician team — and married couple — Chieh-Ju Chao and Chia-Chun Chiang to the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI (HAI) to learn how to bridge the gap.\nImproving Treatment for Migraine Patients\nAt the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, Chia-Chun Chiang splits her medical practice between treating patients who’ve suffered acute stroke and migraine sufferers who come to her to seek help with the intense headaches that can sometimes incapacitate them for weeks, months, or longer. Chiang, a specialist in headache medicine and vascular neurology, not only hopes to improve these daily realities for her patients but also wants to explore how AI may someday lead to better overall treatment through exciting new breakthroughs.\nFor the next year, Chiang will be a visiting scholar at Stanford HAI, where she’s exploring the intersection of AI and neurology. The appointment is part of a new collaborative program between HAI and the Mayo Clinic and will give Chiang a chance to do what she’s always loved — find innovative solutions to challenging medical questions.\nBorn in Taiwan, Chiang found her medical horizons were expanded early in her career, both by her neurosurgeon father and a series of influential mentors on two continents.\n“My father always encouraged me to think not just about day-to-day realities in medical practice but about making research breakthroughs in medicine — about discovery,” she says. “Arthur Chiou, a professor of biophotonics at National Yang Ming University, opened a window for me to see different types of medical research. Later, I came to the University of California, San Diego, and met Professor Shu Chien in the department of bioengineering. He got me into the world of using math and physics to solve medical research problems. It was inspiring.”\nChiang’s time at Stanford HAI will be spent on several research projects focusing on her special interest in migraine and stroke. She hopes to use AI to help doctors determine which of many preventive migraine medications might help chronic migraine sufferers — those experiencing migraine attacks more than 15 days per month — stave off debilitating attacks.\n“Right now there’s no way to predict if a patient will respond to medication A, B, C, D, or E,” she says. “It’s a trial-and-error process, where we start with one medication and wait three months to see if it helps. This can be a long time and a long process when you’re in pain. I’m hoping to be able to apply advanced machine learning technologies to the Mayo Clinic’s established headache database to help predict good matches or to develop personalized treatment plans for patients with migraine.”\nChiang is also collaborating with Nigam Shah, a Stanford professor of medicine and chief data scientist for Stanford Health Care, to be able to more effectively utilize all of a patient’s electronic health record data to understand which migraine patients might be at risk of stroke and cardiovascular disease.\n“Things like clinician notes, consultations, and admission notes are written in free text, which traditionally have been hard for data scientists to access,” she says. “Dr. Shah’s lab has developed several advanced machine learning tools tailored to health care notes that can extract and use this sort of information. We hope to be able to apply these tools to databases at the Mayo Clinic and at Stanford to give us some solid research results from two different health care systems.”\nChiang says AI is changing the field of neurology through innovations such as telemedicine and AI-assisted CT analysis, both of which benefit stroke patients, particularly those in isolated regions of the country where small hospitals may not have neurologists on staff. Continuing the introduction of relevant and user-friendly technology into health care, however, will require improved communication between those who develop AI and those who treat patients.\n“I’m very excited about the use of AI in my field, which is why I wanted to come to HAI and contribute to this process by stimulating more discussion and work between data scientists and clinicians,” she says. “I see patients who are suffering every day in clinic. It’s crucial for us to continue imagining how AI tools can be developed to improve their quality of life.”\nDeveloping Better Tools for Echocardiography\nMayo Clinic cardiologist Chieh-Ju Chao was a teenager in Taiwan when the college entrance exam set him on a trajectory to medical school. Deep down, though, the 18-year-old harbored a secret ambition.\n“I was happy to go into medicine, but I always loved physics,” he says. “It was always in the back of my mind. I love the beauty of the laws and formulas in physics and, as a kid, I dreamed of being the next Einstein or Feynman.” After medical school, Chao took postgraduate physics courses in Taiwan before becoming a postdoctoral fellow at UC San Diego, where he led a research project to build a 3D dynamic heart model. He began to see intersections between physics and medicine, particularly in the field of cardiology. “It was one of the most important periods of my life and one that really changed my career path,” he says.\nFor the next year, Chao will have a chance to deeply explore his interdisciplinary interests, as a visiting scholar at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence. As part of a collaborative program between Stanford HAI and the Mayo Clinic, facilitated and guided by HAI Co-Director Fei-Fei Li, Chao will expand his current research on the potential use of AI technology to augment echocardiography, which harnesses ultrasound waves to examine the anatomy and dynamics of the heart. Chao hopes his dual background in medicine and technology will allow him to bridge the knowledge gap that often exists between health care and technology professionals and to accelerate the expansion of AI systems into clinical medicine at the Mayo Clinic and elsewhere.\n“The usual pathway for this has always been for clinicians to come up with an idea, then talk to AI engineers,” he says. “But that process can take a long time because communication between the two disciplines is not easy. For the first time, this program between Mayo and HAI sends clinicians out into the AI field to learn some of these skills and take them back. I knew this was something I wanted to do. I see myself as a person who will be able to speak both languages.”\nAt the Mayo Clinic, Chao studies how AI models might be used to solve clinical questions, such as how to classify different grades of cardiac diastolic dysfunction, which occur when the heart’s damaged ventricles are unable to completely fill with blood. (That work, in fact, resulted in Chao being named a “Young Investigator Award” finalist at the 2022 American College of Cardiology Conference.)\nAt Stanford HAI, he’ll focus on two primary research projects. The first will incorporate the use of AI to give cardiologists a more realistic view of the heart during procedures such as aortic and mitral valve replacements, which are often done with the use of catheters rather than open-heart surgery. Positioning these catheters currently relies on the 2D images provided by echocardiogram and X-ray. Chao envisions AI models that might be able to compile that information with CT images of the patient’s heart, giving doctors a real-time 3D and even hologram-based picture that would make the procedure smoother and more efficient.\n“Our goal is to improve success rates, minimize complications, and lessen radiation exposure through shorter procedures,” Chao says. “It could potentially shorten procedure times from five or six hours to two or three and allow a more efficient use of our procedure room resources.”\nSecondly, Chao will explore the potential use of AI visual linguistic models to generate time-consuming echocardiography reports more efficiently. Ideally, the model would have the capacity to do an initial interpretation of the study and generate a preliminary report that could then be reviewed by clinicians.\n“This would be an advancement in current AI application in the medical field,” Chao says. “People have been trying to create systems that can report on chest X-rays, which are a single image. In an echo study, we’re dealing with video clips that record the cardiac dynamics from different views. It’s an even more exciting challenge.”\nChao says he’s motivated both by colleagues at the Mayo Clinic who are enthusiastic about this work as well as the range of scholars and technical resources he’s finding at Stanford HAI.\n“It’s amazing to work with cutting-edge AI scientists and the latest technology,” he says. “Talking about my clinical ideas with colleagues here in this setting is a very different and immersive learning experience for me, and these conversations are generating new ideas as I learn about what people are doing here and about potential applications I hadn’t thought about. It’s all really exciting.”\nStanford HAI’s mission is to advance AI research, education, policy and practice to improve the human condition.

In addition, strong performance requires models to move beyond short passages of text to understand complex multimodal data, including images, videos, and the extensive length and breadth of electronic health records (EHRs). With this in mind, Gemini models have demonstrated a leap forward in multimodal and long-context reasoning, which presents substantial potential in medicine.\nToday we present two recent research papers in which we explore the possibilities of Gemini in the healthcare space and introduce Med-Gemini, a new family of next-generation models fine-tuned for the medical domain. This family of models builds upon Google’s Gemini models by fine-tuning on de-identified medical data while inheriting Gemini’s native reasoning, multimodal, and long-context abilities. Med-Gemini builds on our initial research into medically tuned large language models with Med-PaLM.\nThe first paper, “Capabilities of Gemini Models in Medicine”, describes a broad exploration of Gemini’s capabilities across a wide range of text, image, video, and EHR tasks. We benchmark the new Med-Gemini models on 14 tasks spanning text, multimodal and long-context applications, and demonstrate strong results, including a new state-of-the-art of 91.1% accuracy for the popular MedQA benchmark.\nIn the second paper, “Advancing Multimodal Medical Capabilities of Gemini”, we offer a deeper dive into Med-Gemini’s multimodal capabilities through application to radiology, pathology, dermatology, ophthalmology, and genomics in healthcare. We focus on clinical applicability, improving benchmarks, and leveraging specialist evaluations to assess the models’ capabilities. For the first time, we demonstrate how large multimodal models can interpret complex 3D scans, answer clinical questions, and generate state-of-the-art radiology reports. Additionally, we demonstrate a novel mechanism to encode genomic information for risk prediction using large language models across a wealth of disease areas with strong results.\nThe broad capabilities of Gemini models in medicine\nIn “Capabilities of Gemini Models in Medicine”, we enhance our models’ clinical reasoning capabilities through self-training and web search integration, while improving multimodal performance through fine-tuning and customized encoders.\nWe then benchmark Med-Gemini models on 14 tasks spanning text, multimodal and long-context applications. In the popular MedQA US Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE)-style question benchmark, Med-Gemini achieves a state-of-the-art performance of 91.1% accuracy, surpassing our prior best of Med-PaLM 2 by 4.6% (shown below). We conducted a careful inspection of the MedQA benchmark with expert clinicians, and found that 7.4% of the questions were deemed unfit for evaluation as they either lacked key information or supported multiple plausible interpretations. We account for these data quality issues to more precisely characterize the performance of our model.\nOur approach utilizes uncertainty-guided web search to enable the model to use accurate and up-to-date information. This approach generalizes to achieve state-of-the-art performance in other challenging benchmarks, including complex diagnostic challenges from NEJM clinico-pathological conferences.\nOn multimodal benchmarks such as NEJM Image Challenges and multimodal USMLE-style questions, Med-Gemini achieves a new state of the art, surpassing GPT-4 V by a wide margin. We demonstrate the effectiveness of long-context capabilities through medical video and EHR question answering on which Med-Gemini surpasses prior bespoke methods in a zero-shot manner. In order to assess performance on common text-based tasks, we evaluated performance on medical text summarization and simplification of referral letter generation, finding that Med-Gemini–produced drafts were preferred to those of clinicians for succinctness, coherence, and in some cases also for accuracy. In multiple qualitative examples, we demonstrate the clear potential for Med-Gemini to provide accurate and useful conversation about multimodal artifacts such as medical imaging (dermatology or radiology) or long multimodal research articles.\nIn this safety-critical domain, considerable further research is needed before real-world application can be considered. For example, additional research and evaluations on potential biases, safety, and reliability are essential to ensure building safe applications. These systems should also be thoroughly evaluated not just in isolation, but with human experts in the loop.\nAdvancing multimodal medical capabilities\nOur second piece of research, “Advancing Multimodal Medical Capabilities of Gemini”, expands on our multimodal medical large language model work from 2023 by diving deeper into multimodal capabilities made possible by the Gemini family of models. We focus on tuning for radiology, pathology, dermatology, ophthalmology, and genomics applications in healthcare via Med-Gemini-2D, Med-Gemini-3D, and Med-Gemini-Polygenic.\nTrained on a range of conventional 2D medical images (chest X-rays, CT slices, pathology slides, etc) using de-identified medical data with free text labels, Med-Gemini-2D is able to perform a number of tasks, such as classification, visual question answering, and text generation. One example includes report generation for chest X-rays, which was shown to exceed previous state-of-the-art results by up to 12% across normal and abnormal scans from two separate datasets.\nMed-Gemini-3D can also understand and write radiology reports for 3D studies like computed tomography (CT) imaging of the head (example shown below). Volumetric, 3D scans are an essential tool in modern medicine, providing more context for countless diagnostic and treatment decisions requiring an understanding of 3D anatomy. Technically, 3D reflects a meaningful jump in multimodal clinical task complexity when compared to 2D. Additionally, in evaluation of the reports generated by Med-Gemini-3D, more than half were determined to result in the same care recommendations made by a radiologist. However, additional real-world research and validation is needed to ensure consistent expert reporting quality.\nBeyond report generation, Med-Gemini-2D also achieves a new state-of-the-art for chest X-ray visual question answering, and performs well across a range of classification tasks across histopathology, ophthalmology, dermatology, and radiology, approaching the performance of task-specific models.\nBeyond imaging, our new Med-Gemini-Polygenic research model is the first language model to perform disease and health outcome prediction from genomic data. The model outperforms previous linear polygenic scores for prediction of eight health outcomes (depression, stroke, glaucoma, rheumatoid arthritis, all cause mortality, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), type 2 diabetes) and is surprisingly able to predict an additional six health outcomes for which it had not explicitly been trained. Based on this performance, we believe the model is able to leverage intrinsic knowledge about genetic correlation for predicting health outcomes.\nEvaluation is an increasingly critical piece of research in this domain. In this work the team explores both benchmarks and other objective measures for classification and closed-ended questions (e.g., yes/no or limited choice formats) as well as specialist panel-based assessments for text generation and open-ended questions. For the former, the field has relied on traditional benchmarks to provide objective measures of progress, and we use many of them in our research today. For the latter, we believe evaluation is still in its infancy and will benefit from more input across a broad range of health professions.\nConclusion\nOur research provides a glimpse of an exciting future where AI can broadly and deeply contribute to the medical domain. Med-Gemini demonstrates powerful multimodal capabilities that have the potential to assist in clinician, researcher, and patient workflows. While our findings are promising, and provide a step forward in the potential of AI models in medicine, it is important for these methods to be thoroughly tested in a variety of settings beyond traditional benchmarks. This is an essential step to ensure models like these are safe and reliable before being deployed in real-world situations involving patients or other users.\nWe’re excited about the potential of Med-Gemini in the medical domain and believe the broader researcher and developer community can play a role in continuing to improve the model’s safety and reliability, while also helping us better understand novel use cases. While Med-Gemini is not a product offering available for commercial use, one of the next steps is to explore its capabilities through collaboration with Google Cloud healthcare and life science customers and researchers.

Typically, this entails exciting conversations around Google’s mobile platform, Android, or the newest hardware the company is planning to release. However, this year, something else stole the show: Google’s incredible progress in artificial intelligence (AI).\nAI has been all the buzz in both Silicon Valley and around the world for the last few months, especially after the release of Chat-GPT and advanced generative AI systems. This has triggered somewhat of a frantic rat-race amongst tech giants: everyone wants a piece of the AI pie, and the race to the top is intense.\nFor example, Microsoft is investing significant resources into its AI capabilities, relentlessly trying to integrate the technology across a variety of sectors, ranging from manufacturing to healthcare. Amazon is also innovating in this space, offering customers turn-key services to build their own machine learning and AI models.\nIn a similar fashion, Google has made incredible strides in its own AI journey. Though many may suspect that the buzz around AI is relatively new, the company has actually been setting the foundation for advanced language models and usable AI for many years. This work has culminated in products with incredible potential, including PaLM 2, Google’s latest generation large language model.\nAs an introduction to PaLM 2, Zoubin Ghahramani, Vice President of Google DeepMind, wrote last week: “today we’re introducing PaLM 2, our next generation language model. PaLM 2 is a state-of-the-art language model with improved multilingual, reasoning and coding capabilities.” He goes on to describe these capabilities further, discussing how PaLM 2 is trained across 100 languages, has a higher capability for common sense reasoning and advanced mathematics and logic, and can even generate advanced code.\nNotably, Ghahramani also discusses one of the most highly anticipated arenas of impact for AI: healthcare. He delves into Med-PaLM 2, the large language model developed specifically to generate medical insights: “trained by our health research teams with medical knowledge, [Med-PaLM 2] can answer questions and summarize insights from a variety of dense medical texts. It achieves state-of-the-art results in medical competency, and was the first large language model to perform at “expert” level on U.S. Medical Licensing Exam-style [USMLE] questions. We're now adding multimodal capabilities to synthesize information like x-rays and mammograms to one day improve patient outcomes. Med-PaLM 2 will open up to a small group of Cloud customers for feedback later this summer to identify safe, helpful use cases.”\nThe full 2023 keynote can be viewed here:\nGoogle Cloud, especially for Healthcare, has been incredibly successful over the last few years. For example, Google Cloud’s Healthcare Data Engine is an industry-leading platform to optimize interoperability in healthcare, which could resolve some of the sector’s most challenging problems: significant data-fragmentation, lack of cohesive insights, and splintered patient journeys.\nGoogle Cloud’s Global Director of Healthcare Strategy & Solutions, Aashima Gupta, and Global Director of Health Plan Strategy & Solutions, Amy Waldron, explain: “Industry-tailored LLMs like Med-PaLM 2 are part of a burgeoning family of generative AI technologies that have the potential to significantly enhance healthcare experiences. We’re looking forward to working with our customers to understand how Med-PaLM 2 might be used to facilitate rich, informative discussions, answer complex medical questions, and find insights in complicated and unstructured medical texts. They might also explore its utility to help draft short- and long-form responses and summarize documentation and insights from internal data sets and bodies of scientific knowledge.”\nThe Cloud team was also responsible for launching the Medical Imaging Suite, a comprehensive AI platform to make medical imaging data “accessible, interoperable, and useful.”\nUndoubtedly, the development of PaLM 2 will be a gamechanger for healthcare. Whether it be used to conduct advanced analytics of vast amounts of public health or patient data, or simply as a means to better triage and improve physician workflows, the technology has immense potential to create tangible impact.\nEspecially with regards to synthesis and insight generation, this technology may be immensely useful for organizations that want to scale their tactical approach to improving patient outcomes. For example, for public entities, harnessing this technology may one day make possible the ingestion of terabytes of public health data that is otherwise unstructured to generate usable insights. For private organizations, this technology could prove to be a significant boon in the realms of interoperability, improving patient journeys, and succeeding in true longitudinal care.\nNevertheless, this technology requires guardrails. While there is significant potential for beneficial use, there is also some “fear of the unknown.” That is, in the wrong hands, the powerful technology that drives these advancements in AI can have negative repercussions. This is a prime reason why the developer conference had an entire segment dedicated to the “responsible development” of AI, serving as a reminder of the checks and balances needed in this rapidly growing arena of technology. Nonetheless, if developers and innovators are able to create and harness this technology in a safe and sustainable manner, it may potentially change the face of healthcare delivery for generations to come.", "select_response": "<think>\nThe purpose of the current search round is to address specific information gaps related to AI in healthcare, particularly with regard to case studies, cost-effectiveness data, patient satisfaction metrics, comparative studies, failure cases, and treatment planning protocols.

But how do leading institutions like the Mayo Clinic turn AI’s potential into real-world impact? With a strategic approach and a commitment to responsible innovation, Mayo Clinic is setting a new benchmark for how AI can enhance patient care and streamline medical workflows.\nKey speakers\n- Moderator: Gabriel Perna, Modern Healthcare’s Digital Health Editor\n- Speaker: Cris Ross, Mayo Clinic’s Former CIO\nThese insights came from our ScaleUp:AI event in November 2024, an industry-leading global conference that features topics across technologies and industries. Watch the full session below:\nKey takeaways\n- Workforce shortages: AI can help alleviate the strain by automating tasks and improving efficiency.\n- Data complexity: Healthcare generates about 30% of the world’s data, growing at an annual rate of 36%. AI helps structure this data for quality management, reimbursement, and research.\n- Patient experience: AI tools are being deployed to improve patient interactions, such as summarizing doctor visits for stressed patients who might struggle to retain information.\n- Access, affordability, and quality: AI can optimize medical workflows, reducing avoidable medical injuries and improving treatment quality.\n- Cures for complex diseases: AI is already making strides in accelerating diagnostics and treatment strategies for conditions such as atrial fibrillation and cancer.\nAddressing healthcare challenges with AI\nWorkforce shortages and data complexity\nThe healthcare industry is facing a generational shortage of professionals, which poses significant challenges for patient care. Ross emphasized that AI can help bridge this gap by taking on administrative and repetitive tasks, allowing medical professionals to focus on patient interactions and complex decision-making.\n“We have a generational shortage of healthcare professionals.”\n“We have a generational shortage of healthcare professionals,” Ross explained. “AI has some challenges in other industries from an ethical perspective on reduction in jobs, but look, if it can do the jobs of people in healthcare, it’s a hero job.”\nAt the same time, healthcare is one of the most data-intensive industries, with an estimated 30% of the world’s healthcare-related data. This data grows at a staggering 36% annual rate, presenting both challenges and opportunities for AI.\n“Doctors want to have conversations with patients,” Ross said. “So what can we do to improve the patient experience by using AI tools to be explainers, so patients can ask questions of a record and have a computer answer in a sensible way, where doctors don’t have time to answer those questions.”\nEnhancing patient experience and healthcare accessibility\nThe stress and confusion that often accompany medical visits make it difficult for patients to absorb and retain crucial health information. AI tools can improve patient experiences by summarizing doctor visits and providing personalized explanations.\nAdditionally, quality healthcare remains out of reach for many due to accessibility and affordability issues. AI is being used to improve workflow efficiencies, streamline diagnoses, and enhance decision-making to reduce costs and increase care quality.\n“We still have tens of thousands of people who are injured every year in the U.S. from medical injury that’s avoidable. So there’s all sorts of things we can do to improve.” Ross noted. AI can help reduce these errors, ensure more efficient triage, and make scheduling and operational management more effective.\nAdvancing treatments and accelerating disease detection\nAI is accelerating disease detection and treatment breakthroughs, particularly in areas like arrhythmia detection, cancer treatment, and transplant matching.\n“Some of the stuff that we’ve done in Mayo is, for instance, detection of arrhythmias,” Ross explained. “We’re at the point where the rhythms can be detected on a single lead ECG, meaning something that can be in an Apple watch or some other device. From that, we can both diagnose arrhythmias and treat them. So when a patient goes into arrhythmia, you can take interventions to get them back into rhythm.”\nHe also highlighted Mayo Clinic’s work with Google on radiotherapy optimization: “We worked with Google to develop algorithms to do better radiotherapy treatment of disease, and we started with head and neck cancers.” With AI-powered radiotherapy, AI can maximize tumor targeting while minimizing damage to surrounding tissue, potentially transforming cancer treatment outcomes.\nAI at scale: Mayo Clinic’s enterprise-wide approach\nUnlike many healthcare institutions that focus on isolated AI projects, Mayo Clinic has developed an enterprise-wide AI strategy:\nData consolidation: Over a decade, Mayo Clinic unified its electronic health records into a single system, creating a comprehensive, structured patient database.\nAI factory: Hosted on Google Cloud’s Vertex AI, Mayo Clinic’s AI factory supports over 250 AI research and deployment projects, integrating models with real-time patient data.\nCloud app factory: Ensuring AI models can be deployed efficiently within workflows, bridging the gap between innovation and clinical application.\n“We have two jobs: One is to support technology for the world’s best hospital. The second is to innovate at Silicon Valley speed and put solutions into production.”\n“We have two jobs,” Ross explained. “One is to support technology for the world’s best hospital. The second is to innovate at Silicon Valley speed and put solutions into production.”\n“We need to go as fast as we can, but no faster than is safe”\nAs AI adoption grows, Ross urged the industry to focus on the five core challenges he outlined. Looking ahead, he sees a future where startups, research institutions, and cloud platforms collaborate to create transformative healthcare solutions.\n“We need to go as fast as we can, but no faster than is safe,” he concluded, reinforcing the importance of responsible AI deployment in healthcare.\nWith AI-driven solutions already improving diagnosis, treatment, and patient care, Mayo Clinic’s work serves as a blueprint for the future of AI in medicine.\nWatch more sessions from ScaleUp:AI, and see scaleup.events for updates on ScaleUp:AI 2025.", "select_response": "<think>\nThe purpose of the search round is to gather information regarding specific case studies from major healthcare institutions (like the Mayo Clinic), detailed cost-effectiveness data, ROI statistics, patient satisfaction metrics with AI-assisted care, comparative studies between traditional vs AI-assisted healthcare delivery, recent failure cases or limitations, and detailed treatment planning protocols and success rates. \n\nThe webpage focuses on the Mayo Clinic's application of AI in healthcare, covering how AI is improving patient care, streamlining medical workflows, and addressing workforce shortages and data complexities.

Last year at Google Health’s …\nContent: Our progress on generative AI in health\nLast year at Google Health’s Check Up event, we introduced Med-PaLM 2, our large language model (LLM) fine-tuned for healthcare. Since introducing that research, the model has become available to a set of global customer and partner organizations that are building solutions for a range of uses — including streamlining nurse handoffs and supporting clinicians’ documentation. At the end of last year, we introduced MedLM, a family of foundation models for healthcare built on Med-PaLM 2, and made it more broadly available through Google Cloud’s Vertex AI platform.\nSince then, our work on generative AI for healthcare has progressed — from the new ways we’re training our health AI models to our latest research on applying AI to the healthcare industry.\nNew modalities in models for healthcare\nMedicine is a multimodal discipline; it’s made up of different types of information stored across formats — like radiology images, lab results, genomics data, environmental context and more. To get a fuller understanding of a person’s health, we need to build technology that understands all of this information.\nWe’re bringing new capabilities to our models with the hope of making generative AI more helpful to healthcare organizations and people’s health. We just introduced MedLM for Chest X-ray, which has the potential to help transform radiology workflows by helping with the classification of chest X-rays for a variety of use cases. We’re starting with Chest X-rays because they are critical in detecting lung and heart conditions. MedLM for Chest X-ray is now available to trusted testers in an experimental preview on Google Cloud.\nResearch on fine-tuning our models for the medical domain\nApproximately 30% of the world’s data volume is being generated by the healthcare industry - and is growing at 36% annually. This includes large quantities of text, images, audio, and video. And further, important information about patients' histories is often buried deep in a medical record, making it difficult to find relevant information quickly.\nFor these reasons, we’re researching how a version of the Gemini model, fine-tuned for the medical domain, can unlock new capabilities for advanced reasoning, understanding a high volume of context, and processing multiple modalities. Our latest research resulted in state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark for the U.S. Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE)-style questions at 91.1%, and on a video dataset called MedVidQA.\nAnd because our Gemini models are multimodal, we were able to apply this fine-tuned model to other clinical benchmarks — including answering questions about chest X-ray images and genomics information. We’re also seeing promising results from our fine-tuned models on complex tasks such as report generation for 2D images like X-rays, as well as 3D images like brain CT scans – representing a step-change in our medical AI capabilities. While this work is still in the research phase, there’s potential for generative AI in radiology to bring assistive capabilities to health organizations.\nA Personal Health LLM for personalized coaching and recommendations\nFitbit and Google Research are working together to build a Personal Health Large Language Model that can power personalized health and wellness features in the Fitbit mobile app, helping people get even more insights and recommendations from the data from their Fitbit and Pixel devices. This model is being fine-tuned to deliver personalized coaching capabilities, like actionable messages and guidance, that can be individualized based on personal health and fitness goals. For example, this model may be able to analyze variations in your sleep patterns and sleep quality, and then suggest recommendations on how you might change the intensity of your workout based on those insights.\nThis model is being built on Gemini models and fine-tuned on a de-identified, diverse set of health signals from high-quality research case studies. The studies are being collected and validated in partnership with accredited coaches and wellness experts, enabling the model to exhibit profound reasoning capabilities on physiological and behavioral data. For example, we’re testing performance using sleep medicine certification exam-like practice tests, and are already seeing that our model currently performs well. We'll continue to iterate and learn as we build this new Personal Health Large Language Model, and will share more research soon.\nBetter understanding the assistive capabilities of AI\nGenerative AI is already working as an assistive tool for clinicians, helping them with administrative tasks like documentation that typically takes up hours of time. We’re not stopping there – we’re now building on our work with partners to explore what’s possible.\nEarlier this year, we introduced AMIE (Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer), a research AI system built on a LLM and optimized for diagnostic reasoning and clinical conversations. We explored the performance of a LLM by simulating text-based consultations with patient actors, adapting a well-known framework of “Objective Structured Clinical Examinations” to a consumer-facing user interface. In a randomized comparison with real primary care clinicians performing the same simulated text consultations, appropriately trained LLM rated higher than or on par with these consultations when measured for traits like diagnostic accuracy, empathy and helpful explanation.\nOur next step is to test this with a healthcare organization to see how a LLM like AMIE can be helpful in supporting clinical conversations. We hope to learn how clinicians and patients perceive its use within the care experience with oversight from medical professionals.\nHealthcare presents some of society’s most complex challenges. We’re working alongside our partners to see how AI might overcome them and improve care.", "select_response": "<think>\nThe webpage discusses updates on generative AI in healthcare, specifically highlighting Google's initiatives like the introduction of Med-PaLM 2 and MedLM.

The move marks Google's latest attempt to monetize health-care industry AI tools, as competition for market...\nContent: Google on Wednesday announced MedLM, a suite of new health-care-specific artificial intelligence models designed to help clinicians and researchers carry out complex studies, summarize doctor-patient interactions and more.\nThe move marks Google's latest attempt to monetize health-care industry AI tools, as competition for market share remains fierce between competitors like Amazon and Microsoft. CNBC spoke with companies that have been testing Google's technology, like HCA Healthcare, and experts say the potential for impact is real, though they are taking steps to implement it carefully.\nThe MedLM suite includes a large and a medium-sized AI model, both built on Med-PaLM 2, a large language model trained on medical data that Google first announced in March. It is generally available to eligible Google Cloud customers in the U.S. starting Wednesday, and Google said while the cost of the AI suite varies depending on how companies use the different models, the medium-sized model is less expensive to run.\nGoogle said it also plans to introduce health-care-specific versions of Gemini, the company's newest and \"most capable\" AI model, to MedLM in the future.\nAashima Gupta, Google Cloud's global director of health-care strategy and solutions, said the company found that different medically tuned AI models can carry out certain tasks better than others. That's why Google decided to introduce a suite of models instead of trying to build a \"one-size-fits-all\" solution.\nFor instance, Google said its larger MedLM model is better for carrying out complicated tasks that require deep knowledge and lots of compute power, such as conducting a study using data from a health-care organization's entire patient population. But if companies need a more agile model that can be optimized for specific or real-time functions, such as summarizing an interaction between a doctor and patient, the medium-sized model should work better, according to Gupta.\nReal-world use cases\nWhen Google announced Med-PaLM 2 in March, the company initially said it could be used to answer questions like \"What are the first warning signs of pneumonia?\" and \"Can incontinence be cured?\" But as the company has tested the technology with customers, the use cases have changed, according to Greg Corrado, head of Google's health AI.\nCorrado said clinicians don't often need help with \"accessible\" questions about the nature of a disease, so Google hasn't seen much demand for those capabilities from customers. Instead, health organizations often want AI to help solve more back-office or logistical problems, like managing paperwork.\n\"They want something that's helping them with the real pain points and slowdowns that are in their workflow, that only they know,\" Corrado told CNBC.\nFor instance, HCA Healthcare, one of the largest health systems in the U.S., has been testing Google's AI technology since the spring. The company announced an official collaboration with Google Cloud in August that aims to use its generative AI to \"improve workflows on time-consuming tasks.\"\nDr. Michael Schlosser, senior vice president of care transformation and innovation at HCA, said the company has been using MedLM to help emergency medicine physicians automatically document their interactions with patients. For instance, HCA uses an ambient speech documentation system from a company called Augmedix to transcribe doctor-patient meetings. Google's MedLM suite can then take those transcripts and break them up into the components of an ER provider note.\nSchlosser said HCA has been using MedLM within emergency rooms at four hospitals, and the company wants to expand use over the next year. By January, Schlosser added, he expects Google's technology will be able to successfully generate more than half of a note without help from providers. For doctors who can spend up to four hours a day on clerical paperwork, Schlosser said saving that time and effort makes a meaningful difference.\n\"That's been a huge leap forward for us,\" Schlosser told CNBC. \"We now think we're going to be at a point where the AI, by itself, can create 60-plus percent of the note correctly on its own before we have the human doing the review and the editing.\"\nSchlosser said HCA is also working to use MedLM to develop a handoff tool for nurses. The tool can read through the electronic health record and identify relevant information for nurses to pass along to the next shift.\nHandoffs are \"laborious\" and a real pain point for nurses, so it would be \"powerful\" to automate the process, Schlosser said. Nurses across HCA's hospitals carry out around 400,000 handoffs a week, and two HCA hospitals have been testing the nurse handoff tool. Schlosser said nurses conduct a side-by-side comparison of a traditional handoff and an AI-generated handoff and provide feedback.\nWith both use cases, though, HCA has found that MedLM is not foolproof.\nSchlosser said the fact that AI models can spit out incorrect information is a big challenge, and HCA has been working with Google to come up with best practices to minimize those fabrications. He added that token limits, which restrict the amount of data that can be fed to the model, and managing the AI over time have been additional challenges for HCA.\n\"What I would say right now, is that the hype around the current use of these AI models in health care is outstripping the reality,\" Schlosser said. \"Everyone's contending with this problem, and no one has really let these models loose in a scaled way in the health-care systems because of that.\"\nEven so, Schlosser said providers' initial response to MedLM has been positive, and they recognize that they are not working with the finished product yet. He said HCA is working hard to implement the technology in a responsible way to avoid putting patients at risk.\n\"We're being very cautious with how we approach these AI models,\" he said. \"We're not using those use cases where the model outputs can somehow affect someone's diagnosis and treatment.\"\nGoogle also plans to introduce health-care-specific versions of Gemini to MedLM in the future. Its shares popped 5% after Gemini's launch earlier this month, but Google faced scrutiny over its demonstration video, which was not conducted in real time, the company confirmed to Bloomberg.\nIn a statement, Google told CNBC: \"The video is an illustrative depiction of the possibilities of interacting with Gemini, based on real multimodal prompts and outputs from testing. We look forward to seeing what people create when access to Gemini Pro opens on December 13.\"\nCorrado and Gupta of Google said Gemini is still in early stages, and it needs to be tested and evaluated with customers in controlled health-care settings before the model rolls out through MedLM more broadly.\n\"We've been testing Med-PaLM 2 with our customers for months, and now we're comfortable taking that as part of MedLM,\" Gupta said. \"Gemini will follow the same thing.\"\nSchlosser said HCA is \"very excited\" about Gemini, and the company is already working out plans to test the technology, \"We think that may give us an additional level of performance when we get that,\" he said.\nAnother company that has been using MedLM is BenchSci, which aims to use AI to solve problems in drug discovery. Google is an investor in BenchSci, and the company has been testing its MedLM technology for a few months.\nLiran Belenzon, BenchSci's co-founder and CEO, said the company has merged MedLM's AI with BenchSci's own technology to help scientists identify biomarkers, which are key to understanding how a disease progresses and how it can be cured.\nBelenzon said the company spent a lot of time testing and validating the model, including providing Google with feedback about necessary improvements. Now, Belenzon said BenchSci is in the process of bringing the technology to market more broadly.\n\"[MedLM] doesn't work out of the box, but it helps accelerate your specific efforts,\" he told CNBC in an interview.\nCorrado said research around MedLM is ongoing, and he thinks Google Cloud's health-care customers will be able to tune models for multiple different use cases within an organization. He added that Google will continue to develop domain-specific models that are \"smaller, cheaper, faster, better.\"\nLike BenchSci, Deloitte tested MedLM \"over and over\" before deploying the technology to health-care clients, said Dr. Kulleni Gebreyes, Deloitte's U.S. life sciences and health-care consulting leader.\nDeloitte is using Google's technology to help health systems and health plans answer members' questions about accessing care. If a patient needs a colonoscopy, for instance, they can use MedLM to look for providers based on gender, location or benefit coverage, as well as other qualifiers.\nGebreyes said clients have found that MedLM is accurate and efficient, but, like other models, the AI is not always great at deciphering a user's intent. It can be a challenge if patients don't know the right word or spelling for colonoscopy, or use other colloquial terms, she said.\n\"Ultimately, this does not substitute a diagnosis from a trained professional,\" Gebreyes told CNBC. \"It brings expertise closer and makes it more accessible.\"", "select_response": "<think>\nThe purpose of the search round is focused on obtaining specific case studies from major healthcare institutions, detailed cost-effectiveness data, ROI statistics, patient satisfaction metrics, comparative studies on traditional versus AI-assisted healthcare delivery, recent failure cases or limitations, and treatment planning protocols with success rates.

Although there is mention of new papers and research, they do not specifically address the gaps, nor do they delve deeply into treatment planning protocols, ROI, or limitations of AI in healthcare.\n\nThis webpage therefore contains useful information about the responsible application of AI in healthcare but does not meet the specific information needs set out for the search round.\n</think>\n<answer>\nnot satisfy\n</answer>", "judgement": 0}, {"url": "https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/2023-a-year-of-groundbreaking-advances-in-ai-and-computing/", "title": "2023: A Year of Groundbreaking Advances …", "position": 5, "publish_time": "Not Provided", "search_query": "Google DeepMind healthcare AI results 2023", "pk_index": 9, "snippet": "For AI engineers and product designers, we’re updating the People + AI Guidebook with generative AI best practices, and we continue to design AI Explorables, which …", "content": "Snippet: For AI engineers and product designers, we’re updating the People + AI Guidebook with generative AI best practices, and we continue to design AI Explorables, which …\nContent: Company\n2023: A Year of Groundbreaking Advances in AI and Computing\nThis has been a year of incredible progress in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) research and its practical applications.\nAs ongoing research pushes AI even farther, we look back to our perspective published in January of this year, titled “Why we focus on AI (and to what end),” where we noted:\nWe are committed to leading and setting the standard in developing and shipping useful and beneficial applications, applying ethical principles grounded in human values, and evolving our approaches as we learn from research, experience, users, and the wider community.\nWe also believe that getting AI right — which to us involves innovating and delivering widely accessible benefits to people and society, while mitigating its risks — must be a collective effort involving us and others, including researchers, developers, users (individuals, businesses, and other organizations), governments, regulators, and citizens.\nWe are convinced that the AI-enabled innovations we are focused on developing and delivering boldly and responsibly are useful, compelling, and have the potential to assist and improve lives of people everywhere — this is what compels us.\nIn this Year-in-Review post we’ll go over some of Google Research’s and Google DeepMind’s efforts putting these paragraphs into practice safely throughout 2023.\nAdvances in Products & Technologies\nThis was the year generative AI captured the world’s attention, creating imagery, music, stories, and engaging conversation about everything imaginable, at a level of creativity and a speed almost implausible a few years ago.\nIn February, we first launched Bard, a tool that you can use to explore creative ideas and explain things simply. It can generate text, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content and more.\nIn May, we watched the results of months and years of our foundational and applied work announced on stage at Google I/O. Principally, this included PaLM 2, a large language model (LLM) that brought together compute-optimal scaling, an improved dataset mixture, and model architecture to excel at advanced reasoning tasks.\nBy fine-tuning and instruction-tuning PaLM 2 for different purposes, we were able to integrate it into numerous Google products and features, including:\n- An update to Bard, which enabled multilingual capabilities. Since its initial launch, Bard is now available in more than 40 languages and over 230 countries and territories, and with extensions, Bard can find and show relevant information from Google tools used every day — like Gmail, Google Maps, YouTube, and more.\n- Search Generative Experience (SGE), which uses LLMs to reimagine both how to organize information and how to help people navigate through it, creating a more fluid, conversational interaction model for our core Search product. This work extended the search engine experience from primarily focused on information retrieval into something much more — capable of retrieval, synthesis, creative generation and continuation of previous searches — while continuing to serve as a connection point between users and the web content they seek.\n- MusicLM, a text-to-music model powered by AudioLM and MuLAN, which can make music from text, humming, images or video and musical accompaniments to singing.\n- Duet AI, our AI-powered collaborator that provides users with assistance when they use Google Workspace and Google Cloud. Duet AI in Google Workspace, for example, helps users write, create images, analyze spreadsheets, draft and summarize emails and chat messages, and summarize meetings. Duet AI in Google Cloud helps users code, deploy, scale, and monitor applications, as well as identify and accelerate resolution of cybersecurity threats.\n- And many other developments.\nIn June, following last year’s release of our text-to-image generation model Imagen, we released Imagen Editor, which provides the ability to use region masks and natural language prompts to interactively edit generative images to provide much more precise control over the model output.\nLater in the year, we released Imagen 2, which improved outputs via a specialized image aesthetics model based on human preferences for qualities such as good lighting, framing, exposure, and sharpness.\nIn October, we launched a feature that helps people practice speaking and improve their language skills. The key technology that enabled this functionality was a novel deep learning model developed in collaboration with the Google Translate team, called Deep Aligner. This single new model has led to dramatic improvements in alignment quality across all tested language pairs, reducing average alignment error rate from 25% to 5% compared to alignment approaches based on Hidden Markov models (HMMs).\nIn November, in partnership with YouTube, we announced Lyria, our most advanced AI music generation model to date. We released two experiments designed to open a new playground for creativity, DreamTrack and music AI tools, in concert with YouTube’s Principles for partnering with the music industry on AI technology.\nThen in December, we launched Gemini, our most capable and general AI model. Gemini was built to be multimodal from the ground up across text, audio, image and videos.\nOur initial family of Gemini models comes in three different sizes, Nano, Pro, and Ultra. Nano models are our smallest and most efficient models for powering on-device experiences in products like Pixel. The Pro model is highly-capable and best for scaling across a wide range of tasks. The Ultra model is our largest and most capable model for highly complex tasks.\nIn a technical report about Gemini models, we showed that Gemini Ultra’s performance exceeds current state-of-the-art results on 30 of the 32 widely-used academic benchmarks used in LLM research and development. With a score of 90.04%, Gemini Ultra was the first model to outperform human experts on MMLU, and achieved a state-of-the-art score of 59.4% on the new MMMU benchmark.\nBuilding on AlphaCode, the first AI system to perform at the level of the median competitor in competitive programming, we introduced AlphaCode 2 powered by a specialized version of Gemini. When evaluated on the same platform as the original AlphaCode, we found that AlphaCode 2 solved 1.7x more problems, and performed better than 85% of competition participants\nAt the same time, Bard got its biggest upgrade with its use of the Gemini Pro model, making it far more capable at things like understanding, summarizing, reasoning, coding, and planning. In six out of eight benchmarks, Gemini Pro outperformed GPT-3.5, including in MMLU, one of the key standards for measuring large AI models, and GSM8K, which measures grade school math reasoning. Gemini Ultra will come to Bard early next year through Bard Advanced, a new cutting-edge AI experience.\nGemini Pro is also available on Vertex AI, Google Cloud’s end-to-end AI platform that empowers developers to build applications that can process information across text, code, images, and video. Gemini Pro was also made available in AI Studio in December.\nTo best illustrate some of Gemini’s capabilities, we produced a series of short videos with explanations of how Gemini could:\n- Unlock insights in scientific literature\n- Excel at competitive programming\n- Process and understand raw audio\n- Explain reasoning in math and physics\n- Reason about user intent to generate bespoke experiences\nML/AI Research\nIn addition to our advances in products and technologies, we’ve also made a number of important advancements in the broader fields of machine learning and AI research.\nAt the heart of the most advanced ML models is the Transformer model architecture, developed by Google researchers in 2017. Originally developed for language, it has proven useful in domains as varied as computer vision, audio, genomics, protein folding, and more. This year, our work on scaling vision transformers demonstrated state-of-the-art results across a wide variety of vision tasks, and has also been useful in building more capable robots.\nExpanding the versatility of models requires the ability to perform higher-level and multi-step reasoning. This year, we approached this target following several research tracks. For example, algorithmic prompting is a new method that teaches language models reasoning by demonstrating a sequence of algorithmic steps, which the model can then apply in new contexts. This approach improves accuracy on one middle-school mathematics benchmark from 25.9% to 61.1%.\nIn the domain of visual question answering, in a collaboration with UC Berkeley researchers, we showed how we could better answer complex visual questions (“Is the carriage to the right of the horse?”) by combining a visual model with a language model trained to answer visual questions by synthesizing a program to perform multi-step reasoning.\nWe are now using a general model that understands many aspects of the software development life cycle to automatically generate code review comments, respond to code review comments, make performance-improving suggestions for pieces of code (by learning from past such changes in other contexts), fix code in response to compilation errors, and more.\nIn a multi-year research collaboration with the Google Maps team, we were able to scale inverse reinforcement learning and apply it to the world-scale problem of improving route suggestions for over 1 billion users. Our work culminated in a 16–24% relative improvement in global route match rate, helping to ensure that routes are better aligned with user preferences.\nWe also continue to work on techniques to improve the inference performance of machine learning models. In work on computationally-friendly approaches to pruning connections in neural networks, we were able to devise an approximation algorithm to the computationally intractable best-subset selection problem that is able to prune 70% of the edges from an image classification model and still retain almost all of the accuracy of the original.\nIn work on accelerating on-device diffusion models, we were also able to apply a variety of optimizations to attention mechanisms, convolutional kernels, and fusion of operations to make it practical to run high quality image generation models on-device; for example, enabling “a photorealistic and high-resolution image of a cute puppy with surrounding flowers” to be generated in just 12 seconds on a smartphone.\nAdvances in capable language and multimodal models have also benefited our robotics research efforts. We combined separately trained language, vision, and robotic control models into PaLM-E, an embodied multi-modal model for robotics, and Robotic Transformer 2 (RT-2), a novel vision-language-action (VLA) model that learns from both web and robotics data, and translates this knowledge into generalized instructions for robotic control.\nFurthermore, we showed how language can also be used to control the gait of quadrupedal robots and explored the use of language to help formulate more explicit reward functions to bridge the gap between human language and robotic actions. Then, in Barkour we benchmarked the agility limits of quadrupedal robots.\nAlgorithms & Optimization\nDesigning efficient, robust, and scalable algorithms remains a high priority. This year, our work included: applied and scalable algorithms, market algorithms, system efficiency and optimization, and privacy.\nWe introduced AlphaDev, an AI system that uses reinforcement learning to discover enhanced computer science algorithms. AlphaDev uncovered a faster algorithm for sorting, a method for ordering data, which led to improvements in the LLVM libc++ sorting library that were up to 70% faster for shorter sequences and about 1.7% faster for sequences exceeding 250,000 elements.\nWe developed a novel model to predict the properties of large graphs, enabling estimation of performance for large programs. We released a new dataset, TPUGraphs, to accelerate open research in this area, and showed how we can use modern ML to improve ML efficiency.\nWe developed a new load balancing algorithm for distributing queries to a server, called Prequal, which minimizes a combination of requests-in-flight and estimates the latency. Deployments across several systems have saved CPU, latency, and RAM significantly. We also designed a new analysis framework for the classical caching problem with capacity reservations.\nWe improved state-of-the-art in clustering and graph algorithms by developing new techniques for computing minimum-cut, approximating correlation clustering, and massively parallel graph clustering. Additionally, we introduced TeraHAC, a novel hierarchical clustering algorithm for trillion-edge graphs, designed a text clustering algorithm for better scalability while maintaining quality, and designed the most efficient algorithm for approximating the Chamfer Distance, the standard similarity function for multi-embedding models, offering >50× speedups over highly-optimized exact algorithms and scaling to billions of points.\nWe continued optimizing Google’s large embedding models (LEMs), which power many of our core products and recommender systems. Some new techniques include Unified Embedding for battle-tested feature representations in web-scale ML systems and Sequential Attention, which uses attention mechanisms to discover high-quality sparse model architectures during training.\nBeyond auto-bidding systems, we also studied auction design in other complex settings, such as buy-many mechanisms, auctions for heterogeneous bidders, contract designs, and innovated robust online bidding algorithms. Motivated by the application of generative AI in collaborative creation (e.g., joint ad for advertisers), we proposed a novel token auction model where LLMs bid for influence in the collaborative AI creation. Finally, we show how to mitigate personalization effects in experimental design, which, for example, may cause recommendations to drift over time.\nThe Chrome Privacy Sandbox, a multi-year collaboration between Google Research and Chrome, has publicly launched several APIs, including for Protected Audience, Topics, and Attribution Reporting. This is a major step in protecting user privacy while supporting the open and free web ecosystem. These efforts have been facilitated by fundamental research on re-identification risk, private streaming computation, optimization of privacy caps and budgets, hierarchical aggregation, and training models with label privacy.\nScience and Society\nIn the not too distant future, there is a very real possibility that AI applied to scientific problems can accelerate the rate of discovery in certain domains by 10× or 100×, or more, and lead to major advances in diverse areas including bioengineering, materials science, weather prediction, climate forecasting, neuroscience, genetic medicine, and healthcare.\nSustainability and Climate Change\nIn Project Green Light, we partnered with 13 cities around the world to help improve traffic flow at intersections and reduce stop-and-go emissions. Early numbers from these partnerships indicate a potential for up to 30% reduction in stops and up to 10% reduction in emissions.\nIn our contrails work, we analyzed large-scale weather data, historical satellite images, and past flights. We trained an AI model to predict where contrails form and reroute airplanes accordingly. In partnership with American Airlines and Breakthrough Energy, we used this system to demonstrate contrail reduction by 54%.\nWe are also developing novel technology-driven approaches to help communities with the effects of climate change. For example, we have expanded our flood forecasting coverage to 80 countries, which directly impacts more than 460 million people. We have initiated a number of research efforts to help mitigate the increasing danger of wildfires, including real-time tracking of wildfire boundaries using satellite imagery, and work that improves emergency evacuation plans for communities at risk to rapidly-spreading wildfires. Our partnership with American Forests puts data from our Tree Canopy project to work in their Tree Equity Score platform, helping communities identify and address unequal access to trees.\nFinally, we continued to develop better models for weather prediction at longer time horizons. Improving on MetNet and MetNet-2, in this year’s work on MetNet-3, we now outperform traditional numerical weather simulations up to twenty-four hours. In the area of medium-term, global weather forecasting, our work on GraphCast showed significantly better prediction accuracy for up to 10 days compared to HRES, the most accurate operational deterministic forecast, produced by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). In collaboration with ECMWF, we released WeatherBench-2, a benchmark for evaluating the accuracy of weather forecasts in a common framework.\nHealth and the Life Sciences\nThe potential of AI to dramatically improve processes in healthcare is significant. Our initial Med-PaLM model was the first model capable of achieving a passing score on the U.S. medical licensing exam. Our more recent Med-PaLM 2 model improved by a further 19%, achieving an expert-level accuracy of 86.5%. These Med-PaLM models are language-based, enable clinicians to ask questions and have a dialogue about complex medical conditions, and are available to healthcare organizations as part of MedLM through Google Cloud.\nIn the same way our general language models are evolving to handle multiple modalities, we have recently shown research on a multimodal version of Med-PaLM capable of interpreting medical images, textual data, and other modalities, describing a path for how we can realize the exciting potential of AI models to help advance real-world clinical care.\nWe have also been working on how best to harness AI models in clinical workflows. We have shown that coupling deep learning with interpretability methods can yield new insights for clinicians. We have also shown that self-supervised learning, with careful consideration of privacy, safety, fairness and ethics, can reduce the amount of de-identified data needed to train clinically relevant medical imaging models by 3×–100×, reducing the barriers to adoption of models in real clinical settings. We also released an open source mobile data collection platform for people with chronic disease to provide tools to the community to build their own studies.\nAI systems can also discover completely new signals and biomarkers in existing forms of medical data. In work on novel biomarkers discovered in retinal images, we demonstrated that a number of systemic biomarkers spanning several organ systems (e.g., kidney, blood, liver) can be predicted from external eye photos. In other work, we showed that combining retinal images and genomic information helps identify some underlying factors of aging.\nIn the genomics space, we worked with 119 scientists across 60 institutions to create a new map of the human genome, or pangenome. This more equitable pangenome better represents the genomic diversity of global populations. Building on our ground-breaking AlphaFold work, our work on AlphaMissense this year provides a catalog of predictions for 89% of all 71 million possible missense variants as either likely pathogenic or likely benign.\nWe also shared an update on progress towards the next generation of AlphaFold. Our latest model can now generate predictions for nearly all molecules in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), frequently reaching atomic accuracy. This unlocks new understanding and significantly improves accuracy in multiple key biomolecule classes, including ligands (small molecules), proteins, nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), and those containing post-translational modifications (PTMs).\nOn the neuroscience front, we announced a new collaboration with Harvard, Princeton, the NIH, and others to map an entire mouse brain at synaptic resolution, beginning with a first phase that will focus on the hippocampal formation — the area of the brain responsible for memory formation, spatial navigation, and other important functions.\nQuantum computing\nQuantum computers have the potential to solve big, real-world problems across science and industry. But to realize that potential, they must be significantly larger than they are today, and they must reliably perform tasks that cannot be performed on classical computers.\nThis year, we took an important step towards the development of a large-scale, useful quantum computer. Our breakthrough is the first demonstration of quantum error correction, showing that it’s possible to reduce errors while also increasing the number of qubits. To enable real-world applications, these qubit building blocks must perform more reliably, lowering the error rate from ~1 in 103 typically seen today, to ~1 in 108.\nResponsible AI Research\nDesign for Responsibility\nGenerative AI is having a transformative impact in a wide range of fields including healthcare, education, security, energy, transportation, manufacturing, and entertainment. Given these advances, the importance of designing technologies consistent with our AI Principles remains a top priority. We also recently published case studies of emerging practices in society-centered AI. And in our annual AI Principles Progress Update, we offer details on how our Responsible AI research is integrated into products and risk management processes.\nProactive design for Responsible AI begins with identifying and documenting potential harms. For example, we recently introduced a three-layered context-based framework for comprehensively evaluating the social and ethical risks of AI systems. During model design, harms can be mitigated with the use of responsible datasets.\nWe are partnering with Howard University to build high quality African-American English (AAE) datasets to improve our products and make them work well for more people. Our research on globally inclusive cultural representation and our publication of the Monk Skin Tone scale furthers our commitments to equitable representation of all people. The insights we gain and techniques we develop not only help us improve our own models, they also power large-scale studies of representation in popular media to inform and inspire more inclusive content creation around the world.\nWith advances in generative image models, fair and inclusive representation of people remains a top priority. In the development pipeline, we are working to amplify underrepresented voices and to better integrate social context knowledge. We proactively address potential harms and bias using classifiers and filters, careful dataset analysis, and in-model mitigations such as fine-tuning, reasoning, few-shot prompting, data augmentation and controlled decoding, and our research showed that generative AI enables higher quality safety classifiers to be developed with far less data. We also released a powerful way to better tune models with less data giving developers more control of responsibility challenges in generative AI.\nWe have developed new state-of-the-art explainability methods to identify the role of training data on model behaviors. By combining training data attribution methods with agile classifiers, we found that we can identify mislabelled training examples. This makes it possible to reduce the noise in training data, leading to significant improvements in model accuracy.\nWe initiated several efforts to improve safety and transparency about online content. For example, we introduced SynthID, a tool for watermarking and identifying AI-generated images. SynthID is imperceptible to the human eye, doesn't compromise image quality, and allows the watermark to remain detectable, even after modifications like adding filters, changing colors, and saving with various lossy compression schemes.\nWe also launched About This Image to help people assess the credibility of images, showing information like an image's history, how it's used on other pages, and available metadata about an image. And we explored safety methods that have been developed in other fields, learning from established situations where there is low-risk tolerance.\nPrivacy remains an essential aspect of our commitment to Responsible AI. We continued improving our state-of-the-art privacy preserving learning algorithm DP-FTRL, developed the DP-Alternating Minimization algorithm (DP-AM) to enable personalized recommendations with rigorous privacy protection, and defined a new general paradigm to reduce the privacy costs for many aggregation and learning tasks. We also proposed a scheme for auditing differentially private machine learning systems.\nOn the applications front we demonstrated that DP-SGD offers a practical solution in the large model fine-tuning regime and showed that images generated by DP diffusion models are useful for a range of downstream tasks. We proposed a new algorithm for DP training of large embedding models that provides efficient training on TPUs without compromising accuracy.\nWe also teamed up with a broad group of academic and industrial researchers to organize the first Machine Unlearning Challenge to address the scenario in which training images are forgotten to protect the privacy or rights of individuals. We shared a mechanism for extractable memorization, and participatory systems that give users more control over their sensitive data.\nWe continued to expand the world’s largest corpus of atypical speech recordings to >1M utterances in Project Euphonia, which enabled us to train a Universal Speech Model to better recognize atypical speech by 37% on real-world benchmarks.\nWe also built an audiobook recommendation system for students with reading disabilities such as dyslexia.\nAdversarial Testing\nOur work in adversarial testing engaged community voices from historically marginalized communities. We partnered with groups such as the Equitable AI Research Round Table (EARR) to ensure we represent the diverse communities who use our models and engage with external users to identify potential harms in generative model outputs.\nWe established a dedicated Google AI Red Team focused on testing AI models and products for security, privacy, and abuse risks. We showed that attacks such as “poisoning” or adversarial examples can be applied to production models and surface additional risks such as memorization in both image and text generative models. We also demonstrated that defending against such attacks can be challenging, as merely applying defenses can cause other security and privacy leakages. We also introduced model evaluation for extreme risks, such as offensive cyber capabilities or strong manipulation skills.\nDemocratizing AI Though Tools and Education\nAs we advance the state-of-the-art in ML and AI, we also want to ensure people can understand and apply AI to specific problems. We released MakerSuite (now Google AI Studio), a web-based tool that enables AI developers to quickly iterate and build lightweight AI-powered apps. To help AI engineers better understand and debug AI, we released LIT 1.0, a state-of-the-art, open-source debugger for machine learning models.\nColab, our tool that helps developers and students access powerful computing resources right in their web browser, reached over 10 million users. We’ve just added AI-powered code assistance to all users at no cost — making Colab an even more helpful and integrated experience in data and ML workflows.\nTo ensure AI produces accurate knowledge when put to use, we also recently introduced FunSearch, a new approach that generates verifiably true knowledge in mathematical sciences using evolutionary methods and large language models.\nFor AI engineers and product designers, we’re updating the People + AI Guidebook with generative AI best practices, and we continue to design AI Explorables, which includes how and why models sometimes make incorrect predictions confidently.\nCommunity Engagement\nWe continue to advance the fields of AI and computer science by publishing much of our work and participating in and organizing conferences. We have published more than 500 papers so far this year, and have strong presences at conferences like ICML (see the Google Research and Google DeepMind posts), ICLR (Google Research, Google DeepMind), NeurIPS (Google Research, Google DeepMind), ICCV, CVPR, ACL, CHI, and Interspeech. We are also working to support researchers around the world, participating in events like the Deep Learning Indaba, Khipu, supporting PhD Fellowships in Latin America, and more. We also worked with partners from 33 academic labs to pool data from 22 different robot types and create the Open X-Embodiment dataset and RT-X model to better advance responsible AI development.\nGoogle has spearheaded an industry-wide effort to develop AI safety benchmarks under the MLCommons standards organization with participation from several major players in the generative AI space including OpenAI, Anthropic, Microsoft, Meta, Hugging Face, and more. Along with others in the industry we also co-founded the Frontier Model Forum (FMF), which is focused on ensuring safe and responsible development of frontier AI models. With our FMF partners and other philanthropic organizations, we launched a $10 million AI Safety Fund to advance research into the ongoing development of the tools for society to effectively test and evaluate the most capable AI models.\nIn close partnership with Google.org, we worked with the United Nations to build the UN Data Commons for the Sustainable Development Goals, a tool that tracks metrics across the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, and supported projects from NGOs, academic institutions, and social enterprises on using AI to accelerate progress on the SDGs.\nThe items highlighted in this post are a small fraction of the research work we have done throughout the last year. Find out more at the Google Research and Google DeepMind blogs, and our list of publications.\nFuture Vision\nAs multimodal models become even more capable, they will empower people to make incredible progress in areas from science to education to entirely new areas of knowledge.\nProgress continues apace, and as the year advances, and our products and research advance as well, people will find more and interesting creative uses for AI.\nEnding this Year-in-Review where we began, as we say in Why We Focus on AI (and to what end):\nIf pursued boldly and responsibly, we believe that AI can be a foundational technology that transforms the lives of people everywhere — this is what excites us!\nThis Year-in-Review is cross-posted on both the Google Research Blog and the Google DeepMind Blog.", "select_response": "<think>\nThe webpage provided is primarily focused on recent advancements and progress made by Google and DeepMind in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and its various applications.

Our recent AI breakthroughs provide unprecedented opportunities to make healthcare more accessible, personalized and effective for everyone, and to significantly accelerate scientific discovery. Here’s an update on our progress, how we’re collaborating with partners to bring AI to global healthcare settings and our recently announced AI co-scientist.\nAI is making accurate health information more accessible\nGoogle is often the first place people turn to when they are looking for answers to health-related questions, so we strive to make sure everyone has access to relevant, high-quality health information in their moment of need. Using Lens, people can take a picture to search skin conditions that are visually similar to what they see on their own skin, and on YouTube, we piloted AI tools with health creators and organizations like Cleveland Clinic to make it easier for them to publish authoritative, high-quality content.\nFor care providers, we launched MedLM and Search for Healthcare which can provide answers to medical questions. These are available on the Google Cloud Vertex AI platform, helping clinicians make more informed decisions and helping patients receive the precise care they need. Our research into medical factuality ensures that health-related content generated by language models is as reliable and grounded in factual sources as possible.\nGenerative AI is paving the way for personalized healthcare\nWith advancements in multimodality and conversational AI, we’re able to reimagine patient care and how it could be personalized for everyone, with an emphasis on preventive healthcare.\nFrom X-rays to digital health records, medicine is multimodal. Building on our MedLM research, we developed Med-Gemini, next-generation models for healthcare which have Gemini’s superior multimodal and reasoning capabilities and are fine-tuned on de-identified medical data. In published research, Med-Gemini achieved 91.1% accuracy on U.S. medical exam-style questions, and we demonstrated how the models can effectively interpret 3D scans or answer complex clinical questions.\nWe’re researching how AI systems could serve as conversational diagnostic partners in clinical settings, using Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer (AMIE), a research AI system optimized for diagnostic reasoning and conversations. It is designed to take a “clinical history” and ask intelligent questions to help derive a differential diagnosis and handle discussions with empathy, including in subspecialist domains.\nMobile and wearable devices are another promising area where generative AI models could provide personalized insights for both healthcare and wellness, using data such as step count and heart rate. We designed the Personal Health Large Language Model, another fine-tuned version of Gemini, which can interpret sensor data and generate insights and recommendations about an individual’s sleep and fitness patterns.\nAI is improving health outcomes globally\nEarly diagnosis of disease is critical for improving health outcomes. Over the past decade, we’ve tapped into AI’s imaging and diagnostic capabilities and developed AI models to help detect diseases including breast cancer, lung cancer and diabetic retinopathy. Through partnerships, we’re now bringing these solutions at scale to clinical settings so that more patients can benefit from timely and accurate screenings. The impact is particularly profound in low-resource medical settings and countries with fewer specialist doctors per capita. Over the next decade, our health-tech partners in India and Thailand aim to deliver 6 million diabetic retinopathy screenings at no cost to patients, and Apollo Radiology International will build on our AI models to provide 3 million free screenings across India for tuberculosis, lung cancer and breast cancer. Adding to our various initiatives to address maternal health in Africa, we’re also developing an ML model for cardiotocography, used to predict fetal well-being, and exploring its utility in medical settings with limited resources.\nWe’re also laying the technological foundations for broader access to healthcare. Our Health AI Developer Foundations include open-weight models and resources to help developers build AI models for healthcare more efficiently. And solutions powered by our Open Health Stack (OHS) — a suite of open-source tools that makes it easier for developers to create next-gen digital health solutions for healthcare workers — have already been deployed across regions in Africa, South Asia and Southeast Asia to support frontline healthcare workers serving millions of patients.\nAI is accelerating scientific discovery\nMedicine is rooted in science. Building on AI’s ability to synthesize information and perform complex reasoning tasks, we’re exploring how it could augment scientific and biomedical discovery through our work on AI co-scientist, a multi-agent AI system based on Gemini 2.0. AI co-scientist is designed to function as a collaborative tool for scientists. It’s intended to uncover new, original knowledge and help scientists formulate novel research hypotheses and proposals, building upon prior evidence and tailored to specific research objectives. It has already demonstrated potential in areas such as drug repurposing for acute myeloid leukemia, proposing hypotheses for novel treatment targets for liver fibrosis and explaining mechanisms of horizontal gene transfer underlying antimicrobial resistance — each of which is a complex application and presents a different set of challenges.\nWe continue to realize the incredible potential of AI to advance science and improve, personalize and democratize access to healthcare.

Build technologies that work together: Effective healthcare technologies must work …\nContent: Company\nWe are very excited to announce the launch of DeepMind Health\nWe founded DeepMind to solve intelligence and use it to make the world a better place by developing technologies that help address some of society's toughest challenges. It was clear to us that we should focus on healthcare because it’s an area where we believe we can make a real difference to people’s lives across the world.\nWe're starting in the UK, where the National Health Service is hugely important to our team. The NHS helped bring many of us into the world, and has looked after our loved ones when they've most needed help. We want to see the NHS thrive, and to ensure that its talented clinicians get the tools and support they need to continue providing world-class care.\nFrontline nurses, doctors and other healthcare professionals who spend their days treating patients know better than anyone what's needed to provide outstanding care. We at DeepMind Health aim to support clinicians by providing the technical expertise needed to build and scale technologies that help them provide the best possible care to their patients.\nThe Future\nWhile projects like Hark and AKI detection are in their early stages, the problems they solve are fundamental to the NHS. The hope is that these tools can help shift more resources away from reaction and towards better prevention. Ultimately the aim is to give nurses and doctors more time to focus on what’s most important.\nThese past few months have given us a glimpse of what’s possible. As we continue to explore what nurses and doctors need, and work with them to design and scale new and better tools, we will remain guided by the following principles:\n- Valuing clinician and patient expertise: Nurses, doctors and patients are the experts — we can help by building tools that support them. Everything we do will be driven by the needs and insights of those involved in frontline care. From identifying challenges, to co-designing solutions, to oversight and governance, clinicians and patients will lead us every step of the way.\n- Stand behind the National Health Service: We are proud supporters of the NHS and believe in the core principle that healthcare should be universally available and free at the point of use. DeepMind Health’s work will support and strengthen the delivery of exemplary care in the NHS.\n- Build technologies that work together: Effective healthcare technologies must work well with existing systems while supporting further innovation by clinicians and technologists. We will develop open and interoperable technology while absolutely protecting the confidentiality of patient data. This ensures that the benefits of innovation are widely shared.\nThe world’s toughest problems become more tractable when diverse teams of leading practitioners work together in partnership. Building world-class technologies that support clinicians is one of the most important things we can do, and DeepMind Health is our promise to do just that.", "select_response": "<think>\nThe purpose of this search round is to gather specific case studies, cost-effectiveness data, patient satisfaction metrics, and comparative studies related to AI-assisted healthcare, specifically targeting known healthcare institutions and technology systems.

Researchers note that conventional learning algorithms often do not incorporate existing scientific knowledge or hypotheses. Instead, these rely heavily on large, unbiased datasets, which can be challenging to obtain.\nAccording to Dr. Li, this limitation considerably restricts the flexibility of AI methods and their uses in areas that demand knowledge discovery, like medicine.\nAI is a valuable tool for identifying patterns in large and complex datasets like those employed in cancer research. The central challenge in using conventional AI has been maximizing the embedded information within those datasets.\n\"Lack of integration between existing knowledge and hypothesis can be a problem. AI models may produce results without careful design from researchers and clinicians what we refer to as the 'rubbish in rubbish out’ problem,\" says Dr. Li. \"Without being guided by scientific questions, AI may provide less efficient analyses and struggle to yield significant insights that can help form testable hypotheses and move medicine forward.\"\nWith hypothesis-driven AI, researchers look to find ways to incorporate an understanding of a disease, for example, integrating known pathogenic genetic variants and interactions between certain genes in cancer into the design of the learning algorithm. This will enable researchers and clinicians to determine which components contribute to model performance and, hence, enhance interpretability. Further, this strategy can address dataset issues and promote our focus on open scientific questions.\n\"This new class of AI opens a new avenue for better understanding the interactions between cancer and the immune system and holds great promise not only to test medical hypotheses but also predict and explain how patients will respond to immunotherapies,\" says Daniel Billadeau, Ph.D., a professor in Mayo Clinic's Department of Immunology. Billadeau is a co-author and co-inventor of the study and has a long-standing research interest in cancer immunology.\nThe research team says hypothesis-driven AI can be used in all sorts of cancer research applications, including tumor classification, patient stratification, cancer gene discovery, drug response prediction and tumor spatial organization.\nBenefits of hypothesis-driven AI:\n- Targeted: Focuses on specific hypotheses or research questions.\n- Leverages existing knowledge: Guides exploration to find previously missed connections.\n- More interpretable: Results are easier to understand than with conventional AI.\n- Reduced resource needs: Requires less data and computing power.\n- \"Machine-based reasoning\": Helps scientists test and validate hypotheses by incorporating hypotheses and biological and medical knowledge into the design of the learning algorithm.\nDr. Li notes that the disadvantage of this tool is that creating these types of algorithms requires expertise and specialized knowledge, potentially limiting wide accessibility. There is also potential for building in bias, and they say researchers must watch for that when applying different pieces of information. In addition, researchers generally have a limited scope and won't be formulating all possible scenarios, potentially missing some unforeseen and critical relationships.\n\"Nonetheless, hypothesis-driven AI facilitates active interactions between human experts and AI, that relieve the worries that AI will eventually eliminate some professional jobs,\" says Dr. Li.\nSince hypothesis-driven AI is still in its infancy, questions remain, such as how to best integrate knowledge and biological information to minimize bias and improve interpretation. Dr. Li says despite the challenges, hypothesis-driven AI is a step forward.\n\"It can significantly advance medical research by leading to deeper understanding and improved treatment strategies, potentially charting a new roadmap to improve treatment regimens for patients,\" says Dr. Li.\nReview the study for a complete list of authors, disclosures and funding.", "select_response": "<think>\nThe webpage discusses a new class of AI developed by Mayo Clinic researchers aimed at improving cancer research and treatments.

Now that the dust is …\nContent: Alexander Podgornyy, CEO @ IT Medical, software development company, specializing in custom AI-powered solutions for the healthcare sector.\nIn 2024, the healthcare industry explored different use cases for AI to improve care, streamline administrative workflows and increase efficiency. Now that the dust is beginning to settle, healthcare organizations are focused on getting real value from AI in 2025.\nWhile the AI hype persists, administrators are now more focused on securing a clear return on investment (ROI). They are prioritizing technologies that deliver immediate benefits and holding off on those that aren’t fully developed.\nAs the managing director and founder of IT Medical, I’ve seen how AI can transform healthcare by enhancing patient outcomes and streamlining clinical workflows. My work in health tech has fueled my passion for using AI to solve real-world challenges.\nIn this article, I’ll explore five key areas that I believe will become increasingly important in 2025 as organizations adopt AI to achieve meaningful value.\n1. AI-Driven Genomics For Precision Medicine\nAI has revolutionized genomic medicine, paving the way for rapid advancements in precision medicine, a key focus for the future. Cancer is recognized as a disease of the genome. However, our inability to effectively manage and analyze large volumes of genomic data has slowed progress across research and clinical applications. AI-driven genomics promises rapid improvements in cancer care by overcoming these challenges.\nFor instance, a 2024 paper leveraged AI to analyze large genomics and other omics datasets to predict survival outcomes for patients with pancreatic cancer. This demonstrated AI’s ability to generate actionable insights from large volumes of diverse data. Another paper from 2024 used machine learning to identify complex genomic variants associated with psychiatric disorders from standard genomics datasets.\nThese studies deepen our understanding of individual disease risks and support personalized treatment and prevention strategies.\n2. Next-Generation Medical Imaging\nA cornerstone of diagnostics for cancer and other diseases, medical imaging has already benefited enormously from AI-driven processes, and 2025 promises further achievements.\nA study published in January 2025 demonstrated AI’s real-world, large-scale implementation in medical imaging and its benefits to patient care. The research involved the optional AI-assisted mammography screening of 260,739 women from 463,094 patients. With AI support, radiologists increased breast cancer detection by 17.6% and lowered recall rates. Additionally, the AI group had a higher positive predictive value for recalls than the control group.\nGE Healthcare’s Roland Rott predicts that “2025 will showcase many more examples of AI’s ability to improve the lives of cancer patients and the care offered by their providers.” AI not only benefits diagnostic accuracy and supports clinical decision making but also enables faster radiology workflows and reduced costs.\n3. Generative AI For Clinical Documentation And Support\nTechnological developments like electronic health records (EHR) have improved clinical workflows but have led to problems like clinician burnout and documentation burdens. In 2025, AI promises to help reduce these burdens by providing more accurate and comprehensive support during clinical documentation procedures.\nAI-powered scribes can lead to a 170% increase in recording speed compared to in-person scribes, and the use of AI for documentation removes the need for manual documentation by clinicians, representing a potential 90% reduction in time spent on administrative tasks.\nIn a study of more than 100,000 virtual healthcare encounters, clinicians assessed AI-conducted patient interviews and diagnoses. Upon review, they agreed with the AI-generated diagnoses in 84.2% of cases and the top-ranked diagnoses in 60.9% of cases. These results demonstrate AI’s effectiveness in supporting clinical diagnosis in addition to routine documentation tasks.\n4. Integration of AI And IoMT\nThe Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is an interconnected system of medical devices and other technologies that track health parameters and monitor patients. First mentioned in 1999, the IoMT has grown to an estimated market value of 97.7% billion in 2025.\nThe IoMT enables patients to take tests at home, receive reminders to take medicine and allows for real-time monitoring. Wearable technologies are a central pillar of the IoMT, allowing health parameters to be recorded and shared with high accuracy. The data collected by these devices includes but is not limited to blood glucose levels, electrocardiogram readings, skin temperature and respiration rates. This makes them indispensable for tracking chronic diseases such as diabetes and predicting acute health events.\nFor instance, a randomized controlled trial found that daily remote monitoring of cardiovascular parameters and integrating these data within neural network modeling significantly improved risk stratification and appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) treatments. Another randomized controlled trial found continuous glucose monitoring resulted in a statistically significant reduction in hypoglycemia.\n5. AI-Driven Remote Patient Monitoring\nAn essential role of AI lies in remote patient engagement and monitoring. AI-powered assistants mean patients don’t need to rely on non-personalized online information. Instead, they can query symptoms against a personalized system that accounts for their medical history, including recent real-time data.\nA study found that 90% of patients using AI assistants reported receiving useful information for their health problems and perceived it as a helpful diagnostic tool.

A report from the National Academy of Medicine identified three potential benefits of AI in healthcare: improving outcomes for both patients and clinical teams, lowering …\nContent: With the widespread media coverage in recent months, it’s likely that you’ve heard about artificial intelligence (AI) — technology that enables computers to do things that would otherwise require a human’s brain. In other words, machines can be given access to large amounts of information, and trained to solve problems, spot patterns and make recommendations. Common examples of AI in everyday life are virtual assistants like Alexa and Siri.\nWhat you might not know is that AI has been and is being used for a variety of healthcare applications. Here’s a look at how AI can be helpful in healthcare, and what to watch for as it evolves.\nWhat can AI technology in healthcare do for me?\nA report from the National Academy of Medicine identified three potential benefits of AI in healthcare: improving outcomes for both patients and clinical teams, lowering healthcare costs, and benefitting population health.\nFrom preventive screenings to diagnosis and treatment, AI is being used throughout the continuum of care today. Here are two examples:\nPreventive care\nCancer screenings that use radiology, like a mammogram or lung cancer screening, can leverage AI to help produce results faster.\nFor example, in polycystic kidney disease (PKD), researchers discovered that the size of the kidneys — specifically, an attribute known as total kidney volume — correlated with how rapidly kidney function was going to decline in the future.\nBut assessing total kidney volume, though incredibly informative, involves analyzing dozens of kidney images, one slide after another — a laborious process that can take about 45 minutes per patient. With the innovations developed at the PKD Center at Mayo Clinic, researchers now use artificial intelligence (AI) to automate the process, generating results in a matter of seconds.\nBradley J. Erickson, M.D., Ph.D., director of Mayo Clinic’s Radiology Informatics Lab, says that AI can complete time-consuming or mundane work for radiology professionals, like tracing tumors and structures, or measuring amounts of fat and muscle. “If a computer can do that first pass, that can help us a lot,” says Dr. Erickson.\nRisk assessment\nIn a Mayo Clinic cardiology study, AI successfully identified people at risk of left ventricular dysfunction, which is the medical name for a weak heart pump, even though the individuals had no noticeable symptoms. And that’s far from the only intersection of cardiology and AI.\n“We have an AI model now that can incidentally say, ‘Hey, you’ve got a lot of coronary artery calcium, and you’re at high risk for a heart attack or a stroke in five or 10 years,’ ” says Bhavik Patel, M.D., M.B.A., the chief artificial intelligence officer at Mayo Clinic in Arizona.\nHow can AI technology advance medicine and public health?\nWhen it comes to supporting the overall health of a population, AI can help people manage chronic illnesses themselves — think asthma, diabetes and high blood pressure — by connecting certain people with relevant screening and therapy, and reminding them to take steps in their care, such as take medication.\nAI also can help promote information on disease prevention online, reaching large numbers of people quickly, and even analyze text on social media to predict outbreaks. Considering the example of a widespread public health crisis, think of how these examples might have supported people during the early stages of COVID-19. For example, a study found that internet searches for terms related to COVID-19 were correlated with actual COVID-19 cases. Here, AI could have been used to predict where an outbreak would happen, and then help officials know how to best communicate and make decisions to help stop the spread.\nHow can AI solutions assist in providing superior patient care?\nYou might think that healthcare from a computer isn’t equal to what a human can provide. That’s true in many situations, but it isn’t always the case.\nStudies have shown that in some situations, AI can do a more accurate job than humans. For example, AI has done a more accurate job than current pathology methods in predicting who will survive malignant mesothelioma, which is a type of cancer that impacts the internal organs. AI is used to identify colon polyps and has been shown to improve colonoscopy accuracy and diagnose colorectal cancer as accurately as skilled endoscopists can.\nIn a study of a social media forum, most people asking healthcare questions preferred responses from an AI-powered chatbot over those from physicians, ranking the chatbot’s answers higher in quality and empathy. However, the researchers conducting this study emphasize that their results only suggest the value of such chatbots in answering patients’ questions, and recommend it be followed up with a more convincing study.\nHow can physicians use AI and machine learning in healthcare?\nOne of the key things that AI may be able to do to help healthcare professionals is save them time. For example:\n- Keeping up with current advances. When physicians are actively participating in caring for people and other clinical duties, it can be challenging for them to keep pace with evolving technological advances that support care. AI can work with huge volumes of information — from medical journals to healthcare records — and highlight the most relevant pieces.\n- Taking care of tedious work. When a healthcare professional must complete tasks like writing clinical notes or filling out forms, AI could potentially complete the task faster than traditional methods, even if revision was needed to refine the first pass AI makes.\nDespite the potential for AI to save time for healthcare professionals, AI isn’t intended to replace humans. The American Medical Association commonly refers to “augmented intelligence,” which stresses the importance of AI assisting, rather than replacing, healthcare professionals. In the case of current AI applications and technology, healthcare professionals are still needed to provide:\n- Clinical context for the algorithms that train AI.\n- Accurate and relevant information for AI to analyze.\n- Translation of AI findings to be meaningful for patients.\nA helpful comparison to reiterate the collaborative nature needed between AI and humans for healthcare is that in most cases, a human pilot is still needed to fly a plane. Although technology has enabled quite a bit of automation in flying today, people are needed to make adjustments, interpret the equipment’s data, and take over in cases of emergency.\nWhat are the drawbacks of AI in healthcare?\nDespite the many exciting possibilities for AI in healthcare, there are some risks to weigh:\n- If not properly trained, AI can lead to bias and discrimination. For example, if AI is trained on electronic health records, it is building only on people that can access healthcare and is perpetuating any human bias captured within the records.\n- AI chatbots can generate medical advice that is misleading or false, which is why there’s a need for effectively regulating their use.\nWhere can AI solutions take the healthcare industry next?\nAs AI continues to evolve and play a more prominent role in healthcare, the need for effective regulation and use becomes more critical. That’s why Mayo Clinic is a member of Health AI Partnership, which is focused on helping healthcare organizations evaluate and implement AI effectively, equitably and safely.\nIn terms of the possibilities for healthcare professionals to further integrate AI, Mark D. Stegall, M.D., a transplant surgeon and researcher at Mayo Clinic in Minnesota says, “I predict AI also will become an important decision-making tool for physicians.”\nMayo Clinic hopes that AI could help create new ways to diagnose, treat, predict, prevent and cure disease. This might be achieved by:\n- Selecting and matching patients with the most promising clinical trials.\n- Developing and setting up remote health-monitoring devices.\n- Detecting currently imperceptible conditions.\n- Anticipating disease-risk years in advance.\nRelevant reading\nMayo Clinic on Hearing and Balance, 3rd Edition\nMayo Clinic on Better Hearing and Balance helps readers understand the possible causes of hearing and balance issues and offers solutions aimed at improving not just hearing and balance, but quality of life overall.", "select_response": "<think>\nThe purpose of this search round was to gather detailed information on recent initiatives related to the Stanford-Mayo Partnership, emerging AI healthcare applications, technological improvements, and significant research in healthcare AI, particularly focusing on the 2024-2025 timeline. \n\nThe provided webpage discusses the role of AI in healthcare, showcasing some applications and benefits of AI technologies.

Here are some examples.\nAmbient Listening Reduces Clinical Documentation\nMany organizations are already going down the AI path with ambient listening, which are machine learning-powered audio solutions. Used by physicians initially before being expanded to nurses, the voice-recognition technology listens to and analyzes patient-provider conversations in real time, then extracts the relevant information for use in clinical notes, meeting billing and coding requirements. This enables clinicians to focus on the patient rather than having to multitask to complete documentation.\nA major reason that organizations are choosing ambient listening as a first step into AI is that they’ve evaluated and found clear ROI around these solutions when it comes to clinical efficiency and mitigating burnout.\nAnother reason is that ambient listening isn’t considered as risky as it was in the past. It now falls into a category of low-hanging fruit in the healthcare AI space, along with chart summarization.\nPushing for Increased Accuracy and Transparency in Generative AI\nSome healthcare organizations are beginning to experiment with retrieval-augmented generation. RAG is an AI framework that combines traditional vector database capabilities with LLMs. In other words, users get the benefits of a generative AI-powered chatbot that can access an organization’s more accurate and recent data.\nRAG allows the organization’s chatbot to produce better answers for staff in Q&A applications. This reduces some of the pitfalls of using generative AI tools.\nThe use of synthetic data in AI development and testing is another area that will see heightened interest, because having decent data to validate models is a challenge. This is part of a larger trend in model testing and model assurance capabilities. Performance claims for these models will face increasing scrutiny by healthcare organizations.\nIn the past, organizations didn’t know what questions to ask, but now there’s a lot more education available. Healthcare leaders want to ensure that the models do what they promise. Groups such as the Coalition for Health AI are creating frameworks to do this very thing.\nDIVE DEEPER: Demystify artificial intelligence adoption for your organization.\nMachine Vision Improves Patient Care\nAdding cameras, sensors and microphones to patient rooms enables healthcare organizations to collect more data that can be analyzed by AI platforms to improve care. For example, cameras can detect when a patient has turned over in bed, and the platform can alert care team members that they don’t need to turn the patient manually. Some cameras can also detect when a patient is getting up and alert staff so they can prevent a fall.\nAs these tools advance and more Internet of Medical Things sensors and cameras are added to patient rooms, more solutions will combine the AI capabilities of machine vision and ambient listening to improve proactive patient care as well as clinical workflows.\nWill AI Regulation Increase in 2025?\nThere’s already been an uptick in AI regulation, and we expect that to increase due to the nature of AI and fears of the unknown. Whether it comes from the government or from regulatory agencies and organizations, there will likely be new regulation to ensure AI isn’t used inappropriately. However, it’s important to achieve a balance between regulation and innovation.\nHealthcare organizations will also become more interested in learning how to comply with existing regulations such as the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology’s HTI-1 Final Rule regarding health data, technology and interoperability.\nPreparing for AI Adoption in Healthcare\nAI provides healthcare organizations with exciting possibilities for provider experience and patient care, but being able to use AI tools effectively comes down to IT infrastructure. Have an organization’s speeds and feeds been upgraded to handle these solutions?\nOrganizations looking to implement AI solutions should also work on getting their data shop in order. Even out-of-the-box, consumable AI solutions require good data governance. The more an organization understands its own data, the easier it is for the IT team to know how a solution will work in the organization’s environment. If the data isn’t in order, then AI implementation is going to be more of a challenge.\nAI governance is another important factor in achieving implementation success. An organization should have a good definition of what AI is and be able to ensure that the right people exist within the organization to discuss potential risks, ROI and cultural readiness. It’s worth having those discussions early and often to corral the different AI interests inside the organization.\nCONSIDER: When is the cloud right for healthcare organizations deploying AI?\nIT leaders also need to consider how to integrate AI solutions into workflows effectively while gaining user buy-in. The solution may be great, but if it’s implemented incorrectly, then you might as well have done nothing at all.\nMost healthcare organizations have limited budgets; therefore, some AI tools will make the cut while others won’t. Tools that don’t solve an existing problem or provide some form of return on the money being spent will be a lower priority for an organization, which may choose to do what it’s always done instead.\nOnce healthcare organizations are ready to move to the next step of AI implementation, it can be helpful to collaborate with a technology partner that has experience in the realm. CDW offers data workshops to help healthcare organizations prepare their data for AI. We also offer strategy engagements for modern data platforms and deploying generative AI.\nWe can also help executive teams level-set on what AI is and isn’t, and how to approach management. Ultimately, we help guide healthcare organizations to ensure that their AI initiative is sustainable and becomes part of their culture.\nThis article is part of HealthTech’s MonITor blog series.", "select_response": "<think>\nThe Agent initiated this search round to gather information regarding the recent collaboration between Stanford and Mayo focusing on AI in healthcare, emerging AI applications in healthcare, advancements in the field for the years 2024-2025, and significant research initiatives.

Nearly 300 attendees from Mayo Clinic and other institutions gathered in person and virtually to discuss the challenges and opportunities in applying AI technology to healthcare.\n\"As we are entering the era of artificial intelligence, AI has great potential and is already playing a critical role in revolutionizing healthcare and biomedicine,\" said Cui Tao, Ph.D., chair of Mayo Clinic's Department of Artificial Intelligence and Informatics, in her opening remarks. Dr. Tao is the Nancy Peretsman and Robert Scully Chair of AI and Informatics.\n\"Our role as a Research shield enables us to lead innovation and discovery efforts within the AI medicine ecosystem,\" adds Dr. Tao. \"Through collaborative research, we aim to drive advancements to significantly enhance healthcare outcomes.\"\nAI integrates text, radiology images, digital pathology slides, genomics and other sources of information to assist care teams in defining disease and making predictive analyses to support clinical decision-making. This \"multimodal\" AI supports healthcare teams, enhancing their ability to develop innovative solutions and improve patient care.\nDeveloping models and bridging the AI translation gap\nJohn Halamka, M.D., the Dwight and Dian Diercks President of Mayo Clinic Platform and Michael D. Brennan, M.D., President's Strategic Initiative Professor, was a keynote speaker. He emphasized the need for AI solutions to address global healthcare challenges over the next 20 years.\n\"Culturally, I think we have an imperative to build these new solutions,\" he said, noting lower birthrates, higher longevity and higher demand for healthcare in many nations. Automation and AI, he explained, can be part of those solutions, enabling healthcare that is more proactive, less costly, less invasive and more focused on wellness and cures.\nTo create solutions that benefit global populations, AI developers need access to curated, de-identified data with depth, breadth and heterogeneity, said Dr. Halamka.\nMayo Clinic hosts the largest curated, de-identified dataset in the world, he said, representing 32.5 million patients and growing. Companies such as those participating in the Mayo Clinic Platform's Accelerator program can leverage this data within a secure cloud environment to develop AI models.\nOnce developed, these models must be validated, approved by regulatory bodies and implemented so that they are easy for clinicians to use.\n\"Handing a data model and an AI model to a physician is not going to get its use and impact. It has to be fully integrated into their workflow,\" Dr. Halamka said. \"It needs to be just-in-time, there offering appropriate advice without additional effort.\"\nGetting to patients more quickly\nOther headline speakers were Shauna Overgaard, Ph.D., senior director of AI Strategy and Frameworks, and co-director of the AI Validation and Stewardship Research Program at Mayo Clinic; Thomas Fuchs, D.Sc., dean of Artificial Intelligence and Human Health at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; Anant Madabhushi, Ph.D., executive director for the Emory University Empathetic AI for Health Institute; and Hoifung Poon, general manager at Microsoft Health Futures.\nIn her keynote, Dr. Overgaard discussed the \"AI translation gap\" between proof of concept and clinical implementation. The estimated time for translating a basic science discovery to clinical practice is 17 years, she noted. \"We know that as we work toward innovation, we absolutely cannot wait 17 years.\"\nTranslating AI solutions into patient care involves overcoming challenges such as gaining clinician trust, ensuring reliability through continuous scientific validation, securing payer approval, and meeting regulatory requirements. These efforts ensure that AI tools efficiently augment and enhance healthcare professionals' expertise and patient care practices.\n\"Part of our work is identifying potential barriers to AI translation and then working together to close those barriers as well as streamline innovation,\" she said. This will require scientific rigor and multidisciplinary teamwork. Dr. Overgaard said that a solid translational process should enable stakeholders by addressing transparency, reproducibility, ethics and effectiveness.

Generative AI: a time-saving virtual assistant. With staff stretched thin, …\nContent: Dec 03, 2024 | 10 minute read\nFaced with ongoing staff shortages and growing patient demand, healthcare organizations around the world are being compelled to rethink how and where they deliver care. There is also a growing recognition of the importance of reducing the sector’s environmental impact. These 10 healthcare technology trends highlight the potential of innovation to help deliver better care to more people, in a sustainable way.\nWith staff stretched thin, healthcare leaders are turning to automation to reduce the burden on healthcare professionals. The 2024 Philips Future Health Index report showed that 92% of surveyed healthcare leaders think automation is critical for addressing staff shortages by relieving them of repetitive tasks and processes. An equal percentage believe it will save healthcare professionals time by reducing administrative work, allowing them to spend more time with patients. Generative AI has emerged as a powerful tool supporting this healthcare technology trend, promising to boost clinician productivity in ways that seemed impossible just a few years ago. It’s no wonder that 85% of healthcare leaders worldwide are already investing or plan to invest in generative AI within the next three years. We expect this trend to accelerate in 2025 as the sector continues to explore ways of gaining workflow efficiencies with generative AI. Already today, generative AI can function as a virtual assistant to save healthcare professionals valuable time, using large language models to organize clinical notes and simplify the ways patient information is communicated across teams. In areas like cancer care, generative AI could be a game-changer by summarizing vast historical reports to give care teams immediate insights into a patient’s history. It could also speed up reporting and translate complex medical information into common terms, helping to engage patients more in their own care.\nWhile AI can significantly streamline administrative tasks and improve patient engagement, its role in healthcare extends beyond automation. AI can also elevate the skills of healthcare professionals. With experienced staff in short supply in many healthcare systems around the world, AI can help simplify complex diagnostics, enabling less experienced professionals to provide high-quality care with confidence. For example, recent advances in AI have made cardiac CT easier to use, making it accessible to more facilities to increase capacity and deliver better cardiac care to more people. In addition, less experienced technicians can rely on remote consultations and expert training for virtual support and reassurance. Similarly, embedding AI in ultrasound systems allows physicians to detect, diagnose and monitor cardiac conditions more confidently and efficiently. Integrating AI into cancer treatments can also enhance patient care by addressing the increased risk of heart disease associated with therapies such as radiation and chemotherapy. Studies show that adult cancer survivors across a wide range of cancers face a 37% higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease [1]. The latest AI technologies can quickly detect signs of cardiotoxicity early in the treatment process by automating and accelerating echocardiographic measurements. Improved reproducibility and shorter study times make the process more efficient and reliable, reducing the risk of treatment delays. That’s good news for cancer patients who may otherwise face serious heart issues alongside their recovery.\nA silent revolution in surgery is marching ahead as minimally invasive procedures continue to replace traditional open surgeries. These minimally invasive procedures are transforming how providers treat cardiovascular conditions, offering patients faster recovery, reduced pain and fewer complications. With the introduction of new technologies in interventional care, minimally invasive procedures have become more advanced – but also increasingly complex. Physicians need to collect and analyze data from a wide range of sources, such as live 2D X-ray images, 3D ultrasound, Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS), and FFR or iFR physiological flow measurements, all while closely monitoring the patient. That’s why integration of systems, software and devices has become increasingly important. This integration allows interventional physicians to treat patients with greater control and confidence during every stage of minimally invasive cardiac procedures. The latest innovations in image-guided therapy also offer a unique opportunity to expand access to life-saving stroke care. Every two seconds, someone on Earth has a stroke, making it the second leading cause of death and a major cause of long-term disability. Yet less than 5% of our global population has access to mechanical thrombectomy, a minimally invasive treatment that has shown to be highly effective [2]. Expanding access by increasing the number of stroke-ready hospitals and training healthcare professionals in the latest interventional techniques is a cause that Philips is committed to, in partnership with the World Stroke Organization.\nIn critical care, time is crucial – yet always in short supply. Healthcare professionals often lose valuable time pulling patient data together from disparate sources. An open ecosystem approach to patient monitoring can help overcome this challenge by allowing data to flow freely across healthcare technology from different vendors. This creates a unified, standardized patient view that is accessible from anywhere in the hospital. In 2025, expect further advances in patient monitoring based on this open ecosystem approach to healthcare technology. Medical device integration and vendor-neutral interoperability in critical care are already helping healthcare organizations improve clinical efficiency and data accuracy, while freeing up staff to focus on providing patient-centered care. Advancing common interoperability standards with industry partners will further enhance this approach, giving systems and devices a common language to ‘speak to each other’ so that patient information can be shared even more easily. By breaking down data silos, we will also see further development of algorithms that can help care providers predict and prevent adverse patient events. We are just beginning to explore the potential of advanced analytics in critical care, using smart rules to provide care teams with actionable alerts for emerging events. In the future, AI will offer increasingly personalized recommendations by comparing the full patient picture with thousands of similar cases to help determine the best approach for each patient.\nWhile the previous four healthcare technology trends all focus on improving hospital care, there is an equally important trend that will continue to gain traction in 2025: the ongoing shift to managing health outside of the hospital. Hospital-at-home programs for patients who need acute-level care continue to be on the rise, allowing patients to receive high standards of care wherever they are, not just in hospital settings. Remote patient monitoring plays a critical role in this shift by providing healthcare professionals with real-time data to manage patient care from a distance. It has also been shown to be effective in reducing hospital readmissions for patients with chronic diseases such as congestive heart failure and is increasingly used in post-operative monitoring for early and safe patient discharge. Hospitals get to free up scarce beds for patients who need them more urgently, while patients benefit from an improved experience at home. In 2025, we will see further advances in AI and predictive analytics to support remote detection of patient health risks based on vital signs and other data. In fact, our 2024 Future Health Index report shows that remote patient monitoring is the biggest area of planned AI implementation over the next three years, with 41% of healthcare leaders intending to invest in it. This will not only help prevent complications and hospitalizations by enabling timely interventions, but also improve quality of life for patients, offering them peace of mind as they receive care in their own homes.\nThe use of virtual care soared during the COVID-19 pandemic. Today, it offers an opportunity to change how healthcare is delivered around the world by improving healthcare outcomes, particularly in resource-limited settings. Bringing care directly to patients in medically underserved communities or regions is an essential part of improving access, equity and affordability of patient care. From remote patient monitoring and point-of-care ultrasound to real-time video consultations and more, telehealth increases the potential for healthcare to reach more people, no matter where they’re located. It can also reduce the need for specialist visits, as primary care physicians can resolve 40% of issues with the help of telehealth-based specialists [3]. For example, telemedicine capabilities allow sonographers and patients based at satellite locations to connect virtually with doctors to discuss ultrasound findings in real time. These more remote locations have every capability of the main practice – without either party needing to drive several hours. Similarly, digitalization, informatics and AI are improving the quality and accessibility of obstetric care in low-income countries and underserved communities. Interpretation of images obtained through AI-enabled handheld ultrasound is no longer required by the operator, which reduces the training needed to perform the exam. Telemedicine is now being embraced around the world. For instance, healthcare providers in Indonesia – which faces unique accessibility challenges as the world’s largest country comprised solely of islands – are embracing digital health transformation to improve healthcare accessibility and quality, in line with the government’s healthcare strategy. Telemedicine, remote patient monitoring and AI are among the tools that the country will use to provide patients with care, even in remote areas.\nModern parenting has taken on a decidedly digital flavor with the integration of smart devices and apps into childcare routines. Parents now have unprecedented access to data that can help them make informed decisions and receive reassurance about their child’s overall health and well-being. In fact, there’s growing interest in AI-enabled technologies that not only provide monitoring capabilities but also deliver predictive insights about a child’s behavioral patterns. As we move into 2025, we expect an increasing number of parents – particularly first-time parents – to embrace apps and connected devices to help keep a watchful eye on their children. Our research has shown that 80% of parents in the US and 79% of parents in Europe are open to using wearables and smart technologies [4,5], demonstrating the growing desire to implement care routines based on data to support their children’s safety and health. Households are becoming more connected through the adoption of smart home systems, allowing parents to conveniently access device features such as video and audio feeds on their phones or computers. Wearables and smart devices like socks, pacifiers and trackers can provide real-time information about a child’s activities or vital signs, including respiratory patterns, body temperature and heart rate. Some AI-enabled baby monitors can help caregivers decode an infant’s cries, allowing for quicker responses to hunger and other needs. It's clear that digital health tools are transforming modern parenting in remarkable ways. And while these smart technologies aren’t a replacement for active, hands-on caregiving, these devices can offer actionable information, while also giving parents peace of mind.\nAs highlighted in several of the healthcare technology trends above, AI holds immense potential to transform healthcare, increase efficiency and improve lives. And now, AI is also starting to help improve sustainability for companies – including within healthcare technology. Healthcare accounts for 4.4% of global CO2 emissions [6] – more than either the aviation or shipping industries. AI could help analyze supply chains and identify areas for improvement, reduce waste, or improve facility management. Operational efficiencies like this are just the start. AI is also already helping to increase imaging speed, translating into lower power consumption per patient scan. How AI can be leveraged to reduce global healthcare emissions and environmental impact is an area ripe with potential for 2025 and beyond. But along with widespread adoption comes the potential for unintended consequences and significant environmental impact. There’s growing awareness of the need for sustainable innovations and AI models. Healthcare systems are now questioning how AI may be adding to their carbon footprints, while developers are concerned about improving the sustainability of the models. Why? Because digital solutions need significant energy and materials to generate, process and store data, along with water to cool heat-intensive data centers – all contributing to healthcare’s carbon footprint. In fact, the energy consumption of AI is increasing annually between 26% and 36%, and the power usage of data centers could triple within four years [7]. E-waste is another major issue to consider. Generative AI is also expected to generate up to 2.5 million tons of e-waste by 2030 [8]. As we digitalize healthcare, companies are recognizing that managing and minimizing the energy, material and water needs for AI will be essential to ensure the least impact on the environment.\nThe vast majority of healthcare’s carbon footprint – 71% – comes from supply chains through the production, transport and disposal of goods and services [9]. In fact, reducing these Scope 3 emissions is expected to have seven times more impact than just lowering a company’s own emissions. Healthcare organizations are increasingly recognizing the importance of addressing supply chain emissions not just for upcoming government regulations and reducing overall environmental impact, but also for their own financial performance. They are teaming up with partners throughout their value chains to drive change. Greater transparency and sustainable decision-making are already becoming major considerations in supply chains, from circular product design to collaborations with suppliers. According to the 2024 Future Health Index report, over the next three years, 41% of healthcare leaders plan to choose suppliers with sustainable targets and initiatives, and an equal percentage plan to implement sustainable procurement strategies, including circular equipment. Some companies like Philips are working directly with their suppliers to ensure they meet environmental standards and adopt sustainable practices. This type of responsible sourcing of goods and services can have a positive ripple effect within the entire healthcare value chain. Meanwhile, adopting circular practices, which emphasize using less, using longer, and using again, is another way that both healthcare organizations and their suppliers are significantly reducing raw material usage and waste. Refurbishment is one example. Both refurbished consumer products and refurbished medical devices, including image-guided therapy systems and MRI scanners, offer sustainable and cost-efficient alternatives without compromising performance. The refurbished medical devices market is expected to grow from $17.05 billion in 2024 to $30.78 billion by 2029 [10]. By embracing collaborative efforts, healthcare organizations can significantly reduce their environmental impact.\nAs climate change poses increasingly significant challenges, there is an urgent need for hospitals and healthcare systems to enhance their preparedness. The World Health Organization reports that climate change is already impacting health in many ways, including death and illnesses from heat waves, drought, floods, air pollution, wildfires and more [11]. Many healthcare facilities see increasing numbers of patients with climate-related health issues, yet not all are prepared to care for the influx. Issues extend beyond patient care – healthcare must also consider the impact on their own operations and facilities. In 2025, as the global conversation turns toward this topic, we expect that healthcare technology will play an important role in ensuring that the healthcare industry is equipped to handle these growing challenges. One way is through developing resilient infrastructure to ensure continuous and effective healthcare delivery, even in the face of climate disasters. This includes transitioning healthcare facilities to renewable energy sources and implementing sustainable practices to reduce their carbon footprint and operational costs. There are also opportunities for increased training and education programs to equip healthcare providers with the knowledge and skills needed to manage the influx of heat-related illnesses and vector-borne diseases. Additionally, early warning systems could enable prompt responses to minimize health risks, and strengthening community health programs can help improve preventive care and manage climate-sensitive health conditions at the local level. By embracing such initiatives, the healthcare industry can better adapt to the impacts of climate change and ensure a healthier future for all.\nSources [1] https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacc.2022.04.042 [2] https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK562154/ [3] https://hbr.org/2022/05/the-telehealth-era-is-just-beginning [4] Philips Pregnancy+ user survey, 2022 [5] Philips Pregnancy+ parents survey conducted by InSights Consulting, November 2022 [6] https://noharm-global.org/documents/health-care-climate-footprint-report [8] https://www.nature.com/articles/s43588-024-00712-6 [9] https://noharm-global.org/documents/health-care-climate-footprint-report [11] https://www.who.int/news/item/02-11-2023-climate-change-and-noncommunicable-diseases-connections", "select_response": "<think>\nThe webpage provides an overview of 10 healthcare technology trends anticipated for 2025, discussing various innovations and their implications for healthcare, including generative AI, its integration in critical areas like cardiac care, remote patient monitoring, and advancements in medical imaging.

Now that the dust is …\nContent: Alexander Podgornyy, CEO @ IT Medical, software development company, specializing in custom AI-powered solutions for the healthcare sector.\nIn 2024, the healthcare industry explored different use cases for AI to improve care, streamline administrative workflows and increase efficiency. Now that the dust is beginning to settle, healthcare organizations are focused on getting real value from AI in 2025.\nWhile the AI hype persists, administrators are now more focused on securing a clear return on investment (ROI). They are prioritizing technologies that deliver immediate benefits and holding off on those that aren’t fully developed.\nAs the managing director and founder of IT Medical, I’ve seen how AI can transform healthcare by enhancing patient outcomes and streamlining clinical workflows. My work in health tech has fueled my passion for using AI to solve real-world challenges.\nIn this article, I’ll explore five key areas that I believe will become increasingly important in 2025 as organizations adopt AI to achieve meaningful value.\n1. AI-Driven Genomics For Precision Medicine\nAI has revolutionized genomic medicine, paving the way for rapid advancements in precision medicine, a key focus for the future. Cancer is recognized as a disease of the genome. However, our inability to effectively manage and analyze large volumes of genomic data has slowed progress across research and clinical applications. AI-driven genomics promises rapid improvements in cancer care by overcoming these challenges.\nFor instance, a 2024 paper leveraged AI to analyze large genomics and other omics datasets to predict survival outcomes for patients with pancreatic cancer. This demonstrated AI’s ability to generate actionable insights from large volumes of diverse data. Another paper from 2024 used machine learning to identify complex genomic variants associated with psychiatric disorders from standard genomics datasets.\nThese studies deepen our understanding of individual disease risks and support personalized treatment and prevention strategies.\n2. Next-Generation Medical Imaging\nA cornerstone of diagnostics for cancer and other diseases, medical imaging has already benefited enormously from AI-driven processes, and 2025 promises further achievements.\nA study published in January 2025 demonstrated AI’s real-world, large-scale implementation in medical imaging and its benefits to patient care. The research involved the optional AI-assisted mammography screening of 260,739 women from 463,094 patients. With AI support, radiologists increased breast cancer detection by 17.6% and lowered recall rates. Additionally, the AI group had a higher positive predictive value for recalls than the control group.\nGE Healthcare’s Roland Rott predicts that “2025 will showcase many more examples of AI’s ability to improve the lives of cancer patients and the care offered by their providers.” AI not only benefits diagnostic accuracy and supports clinical decision making but also enables faster radiology workflows and reduced costs.\n3. Generative AI For Clinical Documentation And Support\nTechnological developments like electronic health records (EHR) have improved clinical workflows but have led to problems like clinician burnout and documentation burdens. In 2025, AI promises to help reduce these burdens by providing more accurate and comprehensive support during clinical documentation procedures.\nAI-powered scribes can lead to a 170% increase in recording speed compared to in-person scribes, and the use of AI for documentation removes the need for manual documentation by clinicians, representing a potential 90% reduction in time spent on administrative tasks.\nIn a study of more than 100,000 virtual healthcare encounters, clinicians assessed AI-conducted patient interviews and diagnoses. Upon review, they agreed with the AI-generated diagnoses in 84.2% of cases and the top-ranked diagnoses in 60.9% of cases. These results demonstrate AI’s effectiveness in supporting clinical diagnosis in addition to routine documentation tasks.\n4. Integration of AI And IoMT\nThe Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is an interconnected system of medical devices and other technologies that track health parameters and monitor patients. First mentioned in 1999, the IoMT has grown to an estimated market value of 97.7% billion in 2025.\nThe IoMT enables patients to take tests at home, receive reminders to take medicine and allows for real-time monitoring. Wearable technologies are a central pillar of the IoMT, allowing health parameters to be recorded and shared with high accuracy. The data collected by these devices includes but is not limited to blood glucose levels, electrocardiogram readings, skin temperature and respiration rates. This makes them indispensable for tracking chronic diseases such as diabetes and predicting acute health events.\nFor instance, a randomized controlled trial found that daily remote monitoring of cardiovascular parameters and integrating these data within neural network modeling significantly improved risk stratification and appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) treatments. Another randomized controlled trial found continuous glucose monitoring resulted in a statistically significant reduction in hypoglycemia.\n5. AI-Driven Remote Patient Monitoring\nAn essential role of AI lies in remote patient engagement and monitoring. AI-powered assistants mean patients don’t need to rely on non-personalized online information. Instead, they can query symptoms against a personalized system that accounts for their medical history, including recent real-time data.\nA study found that 90% of patients using AI assistants reported receiving useful information for their health problems and perceived it as a helpful diagnostic tool. A paper from January 2025 established a model called CRAFT-MD for testing the applicability of AI models for patient engagement, medical history tracking and questioning, highlighting areas for improvement as these tools become more widespread within healthcare.\nUltimately, AI-driven remote patient engagement is poised to significantly enhance personalized healthcare and improve patient outcomes as its applications expand.\nConclusion\nIn 2025, AI innovations look set to transform healthcare by facilitating precision medicine, improving diagnostic accuracy, enhancing patient experience and streamlining clinical workflows. Early adopters who leverage AI-driven genomics, next-generation imaging, advanced clinical documentation and integrated IoMT systems are poised to achieve significant ROI and better patient outcomes in 2025.\nTo adopt AI successfully, focus on areas where it delivers immediate value, like enhancing diagnostics or reducing administrative tasks. Ensure smooth integration with existing systems, invest in staff training to boost AI literacy and choose a provider with proven healthcare AI expertise for reliable, long-term support.\nAs more healthcare providers embrace these transformative AI solutions, the industry stands on the brink of a new era marked by efficiency, innovation and improved health.\nForbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives.

In other words, machines can be given access to large amounts of information, and trained to solve problems, spot patterns and make recommendations. Common examples of AI in everyday life are virtual assistants like Alexa and Siri.\nWhat you might not know is that AI has been and is being used for a variety of healthcare applications. Here’s a look at how AI can be helpful in healthcare, and what to watch for as it evolves.\nWhat can AI technology in healthcare do for me?\nA report from the National Academy of Medicine identified three potential benefits of AI in healthcare: improving outcomes for both patients and clinical teams, lowering healthcare costs, and benefitting population health.\nFrom preventive screenings to diagnosis and treatment, AI is being used throughout the continuum of care today. Here are two examples:\nPreventive care\nCancer screenings that use radiology, like a mammogram or lung cancer screening, can leverage AI to help produce results faster.\nFor example, in polycystic kidney disease (PKD), researchers discovered that the size of the kidneys — specifically, an attribute known as total kidney volume — correlated with how rapidly kidney function was going to decline in the future.\nBut assessing total kidney volume, though incredibly informative, involves analyzing dozens of kidney images, one slide after another — a laborious process that can take about 45 minutes per patient. With the innovations developed at the PKD Center at Mayo Clinic, researchers now use artificial intelligence (AI) to automate the process, generating results in a matter of seconds.\nBradley J. Erickson, M.D., Ph.D., director of Mayo Clinic’s Radiology Informatics Lab, says that AI can complete time-consuming or mundane work for radiology professionals, like tracing tumors and structures, or measuring amounts of fat and muscle. “If a computer can do that first pass, that can help us a lot,” says Dr. Erickson.\nRisk assessment\nIn a Mayo Clinic cardiology study, AI successfully identified people at risk of left ventricular dysfunction, which is the medical name for a weak heart pump, even though the individuals had no noticeable symptoms. And that’s far from the only intersection of cardiology and AI.\n“We have an AI model now that can incidentally say, ‘Hey, you’ve got a lot of coronary artery calcium, and you’re at high risk for a heart attack or a stroke in five or 10 years,’ ” says Bhavik Patel, M.D., M.B.A., the chief artificial intelligence officer at Mayo Clinic in Arizona.\nHow can AI technology advance medicine and public health?\nWhen it comes to supporting the overall health of a population, AI can help people manage chronic illnesses themselves — think asthma, diabetes and high blood pressure — by connecting certain people with relevant screening and therapy, and reminding them to take steps in their care, such as take medication.\nAI also can help promote information on disease prevention online, reaching large numbers of people quickly, and even analyze text on social media to predict outbreaks. Considering the example of a widespread public health crisis, think of how these examples might have supported people during the early stages of COVID-19. For example, a study found that internet searches for terms related to COVID-19 were correlated with actual COVID-19 cases. Here, AI could have been used to predict where an outbreak would happen, and then help officials know how to best communicate and make decisions to help stop the spread.\nHow can AI solutions assist in providing superior patient care?\nYou might think that healthcare from a computer isn’t equal to what a human can provide. That’s true in many situations, but it isn’t always the case.\nStudies have shown that in some situations, AI can do a more accurate job than humans. For example, AI has done a more accurate job than current pathology methods in predicting who will survive malignant mesothelioma, which is a type of cancer that impacts the internal organs. AI is used to identify colon polyps and has been shown to improve colonoscopy accuracy and diagnose colorectal cancer as accurately as skilled endoscopists can.\nIn a study of a social media forum, most people asking healthcare questions preferred responses from an AI-powered chatbot over those from physicians, ranking the chatbot’s answers higher in quality and empathy. However, the researchers conducting this study emphasize that their results only suggest the value of such chatbots in answering patients’ questions, and recommend it be followed up with a more convincing study.\nHow can physicians use AI and machine learning in healthcare?\nOne of the key things that AI may be able to do to help healthcare professionals is save them time. For example:\n- Keeping up with current advances. When physicians are actively participating in caring for people and other clinical duties, it can be challenging for them to keep pace with evolving technological advances that support care. AI can work with huge volumes of information — from medical journals to healthcare records — and highlight the most relevant pieces.\n- Taking care of tedious work. When a healthcare professional must complete tasks like writing clinical notes or filling out forms, AI could potentially complete the task faster than traditional methods, even if revision was needed to refine the first pass AI makes.\nDespite the potential for AI to save time for healthcare professionals, AI isn’t intended to replace humans. The American Medical Association commonly refers to “augmented intelligence,” which stresses the importance of AI assisting, rather than replacing, healthcare professionals. In the case of current AI applications and technology, healthcare professionals are still needed to provide:\n- Clinical context for the algorithms that train AI.\n- Accurate and relevant information for AI to analyze.\n- Translation of AI findings to be meaningful for patients.\nA helpful comparison to reiterate the collaborative nature needed between AI and humans for healthcare is that in most cases, a human pilot is still needed to fly a plane. Although technology has enabled quite a bit of automation in flying today, people are needed to make adjustments, interpret the equipment’s data, and take over in cases of emergency.\nWhat are the drawbacks of AI in healthcare?\nDespite the many exciting possibilities for AI in healthcare, there are some risks to weigh:\n- If not properly trained, AI can lead to bias and discrimination. For example, if AI is trained on electronic health records, it is building only on people that can access healthcare and is perpetuating any human bias captured within the records.\n- AI chatbots can generate medical advice that is misleading or false, which is why there’s a need for effectively regulating their use.\nWhere can AI solutions take the healthcare industry next?\nAs AI continues to evolve and play a more prominent role in healthcare, the need for effective regulation and use becomes more critical. That’s why Mayo Clinic is a member of Health AI Partnership, which is focused on helping healthcare organizations evaluate and implement AI effectively, equitably and safely.\nIn terms of the possibilities for healthcare professionals to further integrate AI, Mark D. Stegall, M.D., a transplant surgeon and researcher at Mayo Clinic in Minnesota says, “I predict AI also will become an important decision-making tool for physicians.”\nMayo Clinic hopes that AI could help create new ways to diagnose, treat, predict, prevent and cure disease. This might be achieved by:\n- Selecting and matching patients with the most promising clinical trials.\n- Developing and setting up remote health-monitoring devices.\n- Detecting currently imperceptible conditions.\n- Anticipating disease-risk years in advance.\nRelevant reading\nMayo Clinic on Hearing and Balance, 3rd Edition\nMayo Clinic on Better Hearing and Balance helps readers understand the possible causes of hearing and balance issues and offers solutions aimed at improving not just hearing and balance, but quality of life overall.", "select_response": "<think>\nThe purpose of this search round was to gather detailed information on recent initiatives related to the Stanford-Mayo Partnership, emerging AI healthcare applications, technological improvements, and significant research in healthcare AI, particularly focusing on the 2024-2025 timeline. \n\nThe provided webpage discusses the role of AI in healthcare, showcasing some applications and benefits of AI technologies.

Healthcare leaders are interested in AI tools that provide clear value, whether that’s a better clinician experience, …\nContent: Which AI Solutions Will Healthcare Organizations Adopt in 2025?\nHealthcare leaders are interested in AI tools that provide clear value, whether that’s a better clinician experience, reduced costs, increased administrative efficiencies or improved patient care. Here are some examples.\nAmbient Listening Reduces Clinical Documentation\nMany organizations are already going down the AI path with ambient listening, which are machine learning-powered audio solutions. Used by physicians initially before being expanded to nurses, the voice-recognition technology listens to and analyzes patient-provider conversations in real time, then extracts the relevant information for use in clinical notes, meeting billing and coding requirements. This enables clinicians to focus on the patient rather than having to multitask to complete documentation.\nA major reason that organizations are choosing ambient listening as a first step into AI is that they’ve evaluated and found clear ROI around these solutions when it comes to clinical efficiency and mitigating burnout.\nAnother reason is that ambient listening isn’t considered as risky as it was in the past. It now falls into a category of low-hanging fruit in the healthcare AI space, along with chart summarization.\nPushing for Increased Accuracy and Transparency in Generative AI\nSome healthcare organizations are beginning to experiment with retrieval-augmented generation. RAG is an AI framework that combines traditional vector database capabilities with LLMs. In other words, users get the benefits of a generative AI-powered chatbot that can access an organization’s more accurate and recent data.\nRAG allows the organization’s chatbot to produce better answers for staff in Q&A applications. This reduces some of the pitfalls of using generative AI tools.\nThe use of synthetic data in AI development and testing is another area that will see heightened interest, because having decent data to validate models is a challenge. This is part of a larger trend in model testing and model assurance capabilities. Performance claims for these models will face increasing scrutiny by healthcare organizations.\nIn the past, organizations didn’t know what questions to ask, but now there’s a lot more education available. Healthcare leaders want to ensure that the models do what they promise. Groups such as the Coalition for Health AI are creating frameworks to do this very thing.\nDIVE DEEPER: Demystify artificial intelligence adoption for your organization.\nMachine Vision Improves Patient Care\nAdding cameras, sensors and microphones to patient rooms enables healthcare organizations to collect more data that can be analyzed by AI platforms to improve care. For example, cameras can detect when a patient has turned over in bed, and the platform can alert care team members that they don’t need to turn the patient manually. Some cameras can also detect when a patient is getting up and alert staff so they can prevent a fall.\nAs these tools advance and more Internet of Medical Things sensors and cameras are added to patient rooms, more solutions will combine the AI capabilities of machine vision and ambient listening to improve proactive patient care as well as clinical workflows.\nWill AI Regulation Increase in 2025?\nThere’s already been an uptick in AI regulation, and we expect that to increase due to the nature of AI and fears of the unknown. Whether it comes from the government or from regulatory agencies and organizations, there will likely be new regulation to ensure AI isn’t used inappropriately. However, it’s important to achieve a balance between regulation and innovation.\nHealthcare organizations will also become more interested in learning how to comply with existing regulations such as the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology’s HTI-1 Final Rule regarding health data, technology and interoperability.\nPreparing for AI Adoption in Healthcare\nAI provides healthcare organizations with exciting possibilities for provider experience and patient care, but being able to use AI tools effectively comes down to IT infrastructure. Have an organization’s speeds and feeds been upgraded to handle these solutions?\nOrganizations looking to implement AI solutions should also work on getting their data shop in order. Even out-of-the-box, consumable AI solutions require good data governance. The more an organization understands its own data, the easier it is for the IT team to know how a solution will work in the organization’s environment. If the data isn’t in order, then AI implementation is going to be more of a challenge.\nAI governance is another important factor in achieving implementation success. An organization should have a good definition of what AI is and be able to ensure that the right people exist within the organization to discuss potential risks, ROI and cultural readiness. It’s worth having those discussions early and often to corral the different AI interests inside the organization.\nCONSIDER: When is the cloud right for healthcare organizations deploying AI?\nIT leaders also need to consider how to integrate AI solutions into workflows effectively while gaining user buy-in. The solution may be great, but if it’s implemented incorrectly, then you might as well have done nothing at all.\nMost healthcare organizations have limited budgets; therefore, some AI tools will make the cut while others won’t. Tools that don’t solve an existing problem or provide some form of return on the money being spent will be a lower priority for an organization, which may choose to do what it’s always done instead.\nOnce healthcare organizations are ready to move to the next step of AI implementation, it can be helpful to collaborate with a technology partner that has experience in the realm. CDW offers data workshops to help healthcare organizations prepare their data for AI. We also offer strategy engagements for modern data platforms and deploying generative AI.\nWe can also help executive teams level-set on what AI is and isn’t, and how to approach management. Ultimately, we help guide healthcare organizations to ensure that their AI initiative is sustainable and becomes part of their culture.\nThis article is part of HealthTech’s MonITor blog series.", "select_response": "<think>\nThe Agent initiated this search round to gather information regarding the recent collaboration between Stanford and Mayo focusing on AI in healthcare, emerging AI applications in healthcare, advancements in the field for the years 2024-2025, and significant research initiatives.

Nearly 300 attendees from Mayo Clinic and other institutions gathered in person and virtually to discuss the challenges and opportunities in applying AI technology to healthcare.\n\"As we are entering the era of artificial intelligence, AI has great potential and is already playing a critical role in revolutionizing healthcare and biomedicine,\" said Cui Tao, Ph.D., chair of Mayo Clinic's Department of Artificial Intelligence and Informatics, in her opening remarks. Dr. Tao is the Nancy Peretsman and Robert Scully Chair of AI and Informatics.\n\"Our role as a Research shield enables us to lead innovation and discovery efforts within the AI medicine ecosystem,\" adds Dr. Tao. \"Through collaborative research, we aim to drive advancements to significantly enhance healthcare outcomes.\"\nAI integrates text, radiology images, digital pathology slides, genomics and other sources of information to assist care teams in defining disease and making predictive analyses to support clinical decision-making. This \"multimodal\" AI supports healthcare teams, enhancing their ability to develop innovative solutions and improve patient care.\nDeveloping models and bridging the AI translation gap\nJohn Halamka, M.D., the Dwight and Dian Diercks President of Mayo Clinic Platform and Michael D. Brennan, M.D., President's Strategic Initiative Professor, was a keynote speaker. He emphasized the need for AI solutions to address global healthcare challenges over the next 20 years.\n\"Culturally, I think we have an imperative to build these new solutions,\" he said, noting lower birthrates, higher longevity and higher demand for healthcare in many nations. Automation and AI, he explained, can be part of those solutions, enabling healthcare that is more proactive, less costly, less invasive and more focused on wellness and cures.\nTo create solutions that benefit global populations, AI developers need access to curated, de-identified data with depth, breadth and heterogeneity, said Dr. Halamka.\nMayo Clinic hosts the largest curated, de-identified dataset in the world, he said, representing 32.5 million patients and growing. Companies such as those participating in the Mayo Clinic Platform's Accelerator program can leverage this data within a secure cloud environment to develop AI models.\nOnce developed, these models must be validated, approved by regulatory bodies and implemented so that they are easy for clinicians to use.\n\"Handing a data model and an AI model to a physician is not going to get its use and impact. It has to be fully integrated into their workflow,\" Dr. Halamka said. \"It needs to be just-in-time, there offering appropriate advice without additional effort.\"\nGetting to patients more quickly\nOther headline speakers were Shauna Overgaard, Ph.D., senior director of AI Strategy and Frameworks, and co-director of the AI Validation and Stewardship Research Program at Mayo Clinic; Thomas Fuchs, D.Sc., dean of Artificial Intelligence and Human Health at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; Anant Madabhushi, Ph.D., executive director for the Emory University Empathetic AI for Health Institute; and Hoifung Poon, general manager at Microsoft Health Futures.\nIn her keynote, Dr. Overgaard discussed the \"AI translation gap\" between proof of concept and clinical implementation. The estimated time for translating a basic science discovery to clinical practice is 17 years, she noted. \"We know that as we work toward innovation, we absolutely cannot wait 17 years.\"\nTranslating AI solutions into patient care involves overcoming challenges such as gaining clinician trust, ensuring reliability through continuous scientific validation, securing payer approval, and meeting regulatory requirements. These efforts ensure that AI tools efficiently augment and enhance healthcare professionals' expertise and patient care practices.\n\"Part of our work is identifying potential barriers to AI translation and then working together to close those barriers as well as streamline innovation,\" she said. This will require scientific rigor and multidisciplinary teamwork. Dr. Overgaard said that a solid translational process should enable stakeholders by addressing transparency, reproducibility, ethics and effectiveness.

Generative AI: a time-saving virtual assistant. With staff stretched thin, …\nContent: Dec 03, 2024 | 10 minute read\nFaced with ongoing staff shortages and growing patient demand, healthcare organizations around the world are being compelled to rethink how and where they deliver care. There is also a growing recognition of the importance of reducing the sector’s environmental impact. These 10 healthcare technology trends highlight the potential of innovation to help deliver better care to more people, in a sustainable way.\nWith staff stretched thin, healthcare leaders are turning to automation to reduce the burden on healthcare professionals. The 2024 Philips Future Health Index report showed that 92% of surveyed healthcare leaders think automation is critical for addressing staff shortages by relieving them of repetitive tasks and processes. An equal percentage believe it will save healthcare professionals time by reducing administrative work, allowing them to spend more time with patients. Generative AI has emerged as a powerful tool supporting this healthcare technology trend, promising to boost clinician productivity in ways that seemed impossible just a few years ago. It’s no wonder that 85% of healthcare leaders worldwide are already investing or plan to invest in generative AI within the next three years. We expect this trend to accelerate in 2025 as the sector continues to explore ways of gaining workflow efficiencies with generative AI. Already today, generative AI can function as a virtual assistant to save healthcare professionals valuable time, using large language models to organize clinical notes and simplify the ways patient information is communicated across teams. In areas like cancer care, generative AI could be a game-changer by summarizing vast historical reports to give care teams immediate insights into a patient’s history. It could also speed up reporting and translate complex medical information into common terms, helping to engage patients more in their own care.\nWhile AI can significantly streamline administrative tasks and improve patient engagement, its role in healthcare extends beyond automation. AI can also elevate the skills of healthcare professionals. With experienced staff in short supply in many healthcare systems around the world, AI can help simplify complex diagnostics, enabling less experienced professionals to provide high-quality care with confidence. For example, recent advances in AI have made cardiac CT easier to use, making it accessible to more facilities to increase capacity and deliver better cardiac care to more people. In addition, less experienced technicians can rely on remote consultations and expert training for virtual support and reassurance. Similarly, embedding AI in ultrasound systems allows physicians to detect, diagnose and monitor cardiac conditions more confidently and efficiently. Integrating AI into cancer treatments can also enhance patient care by addressing the increased risk of heart disease associated with therapies such as radiation and chemotherapy. Studies show that adult cancer survivors across a wide range of cancers face a 37% higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease [1]. The latest AI technologies can quickly detect signs of cardiotoxicity early in the treatment process by automating and accelerating echocardiographic measurements. Improved reproducibility and shorter study times make the process more efficient and reliable, reducing the risk of treatment delays. That’s good news for cancer patients who may otherwise face serious heart issues alongside their recovery.\nA silent revolution in surgery is marching ahead as minimally invasive procedures continue to replace traditional open surgeries. These minimally invasive procedures are transforming how providers treat cardiovascular conditions, offering patients faster recovery, reduced pain and fewer complications. With the introduction of new technologies in interventional care, minimally invasive procedures have become more advanced – but also increasingly complex. Physicians need to collect and analyze data from a wide range of sources, such as live 2D X-ray images, 3D ultrasound, Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS), and FFR or iFR physiological flow measurements, all while closely monitoring the patient. That’s why integration of systems, software and devices has become increasingly important. This integration allows interventional physicians to treat patients with greater control and confidence during every stage of minimally invasive cardiac procedures. The latest innovations in image-guided therapy also offer a unique opportunity to expand access to life-saving stroke care. Every two seconds, someone on Earth has a stroke, making it the second leading cause of death and a major cause of long-term disability. Yet less than 5% of our global population has access to mechanical thrombectomy, a minimally invasive treatment that has shown to be highly effective [2]. Expanding access by increasing the number of stroke-ready hospitals and training healthcare professionals in the latest interventional techniques is a cause that Philips is committed to, in partnership with the World Stroke Organization.\nIn critical care, time is crucial – yet always in short supply. Healthcare professionals often lose valuable time pulling patient data together from disparate sources. An open ecosystem approach to patient monitoring can help overcome this challenge by allowing data to flow freely across healthcare technology from different vendors. This creates a unified, standardized patient view that is accessible from anywhere in the hospital. In 2025, expect further advances in patient monitoring based on this open ecosystem approach to healthcare technology. Medical device integration and vendor-neutral interoperability in critical care are already helping healthcare organizations improve clinical efficiency and data accuracy, while freeing up staff to focus on providing patient-centered care. Advancing common interoperability standards with industry partners will further enhance this approach, giving systems and devices a common language to ‘speak to each other’ so that patient information can be shared even more easily. By breaking down data silos, we will also see further development of algorithms that can help care providers predict and prevent adverse patient events. We are just beginning to explore the potential of advanced analytics in critical care, using smart rules to provide care teams with actionable alerts for emerging events. In the future, AI will offer increasingly personalized recommendations by comparing the full patient picture with thousands of similar cases to help determine the best approach for each patient.\nWhile the previous four healthcare technology trends all focus on improving hospital care, there is an equally important trend that will continue to gain traction in 2025: the ongoing shift to managing health outside of the hospital. Hospital-at-home programs for patients who need acute-level care continue to be on the rise, allowing patients to receive high standards of care wherever they are, not just in hospital settings. Remote patient monitoring plays a critical role in this shift by providing healthcare professionals with real-time data to manage patient care from a distance. It has also been shown to be effective in reducing hospital readmissions for patients with chronic diseases such as congestive heart failure and is increasingly used in post-operative monitoring for early and safe patient discharge. Hospitals get to free up scarce beds for patients who need them more urgently, while patients benefit from an improved experience at home. In 2025, we will see further advances in AI and predictive analytics to support remote detection of patient health risks based on vital signs and other data. In fact, our 2024 Future Health Index report shows that remote patient monitoring is the biggest area of planned AI implementation over the next three years, with 41% of healthcare leaders intending to invest in it. This will not only help prevent complications and hospitalizations by enabling timely interventions, but also improve quality of life for patients, offering them peace of mind as they receive care in their own homes.\nThe use of virtual care soared during the COVID-19 pandemic. Today, it offers an opportunity to change how healthcare is delivered around the world by improving healthcare outcomes, particularly in resource-limited settings. Bringing care directly to patients in medically underserved communities or regions is an essential part of improving access, equity and affordability of patient care. From remote patient monitoring and point-of-care ultrasound to real-time video consultations and more, telehealth increases the potential for healthcare to reach more people, no matter where they’re located. It can also reduce the need for specialist visits, as primary care physicians can resolve 40% of issues with the help of telehealth-based specialists [3]. For example, telemedicine capabilities allow sonographers and patients based at satellite locations to connect virtually with doctors to discuss ultrasound findings in real time. These more remote locations have every capability of the main practice – without either party needing to drive several hours. Similarly, digitalization, informatics and AI are improving the quality and accessibility of obstetric care in low-income countries and underserved communities. Interpretation of images obtained through AI-enabled handheld ultrasound is no longer required by the operator, which reduces the training needed to perform the exam. Telemedicine is now being embraced around the world. For instance, healthcare providers in Indonesia – which faces unique accessibility challenges as the world’s largest country comprised solely of islands – are embracing digital health transformation to improve healthcare accessibility and quality, in line with the government’s healthcare strategy. Telemedicine, remote patient monitoring and AI are among the tools that the country will use to provide patients with care, even in remote areas.\nModern parenting has taken on a decidedly digital flavor with the integration of smart devices and apps into childcare routines. Parents now have unprecedented access to data that can help them make informed decisions and receive reassurance about their child’s overall health and well-being. In fact, there’s growing interest in AI-enabled technologies that not only provide monitoring capabilities but also deliver predictive insights about a child’s behavioral patterns. As we move into 2025, we expect an increasing number of parents – particularly first-time parents – to embrace apps and connected devices to help keep a watchful eye on their children. Our research has shown that 80% of parents in the US and 79% of parents in Europe are open to using wearables and smart technologies [4,5], demonstrating the growing desire to implement care routines based on data to support their children’s safety and health. Households are becoming more connected through the adoption of smart home systems, allowing parents to conveniently access device features such as video and audio feeds on their phones or computers. Wearables and smart devices like socks, pacifiers and trackers can provide real-time information about a child’s activities or vital signs, including respiratory patterns, body temperature and heart rate. Some AI-enabled baby monitors can help caregivers decode an infant’s cries, allowing for quicker responses to hunger and other needs. It's clear that digital health tools are transforming modern parenting in remarkable ways. And while these smart technologies aren’t a replacement for active, hands-on caregiving, these devices can offer actionable information, while also giving parents peace of mind.\nAs highlighted in several of the healthcare technology trends above, AI holds immense potential to transform healthcare, increase efficiency and improve lives. And now, AI is also starting to help improve sustainability for companies – including within healthcare technology. Healthcare accounts for 4.4% of global CO2 emissions [6] – more than either the aviation or shipping industries. AI could help analyze supply chains and identify areas for improvement, reduce waste, or improve facility management. Operational efficiencies like this are just the start. AI is also already helping to increase imaging speed, translating into lower power consumption per patient scan. How AI can be leveraged to reduce global healthcare emissions and environmental impact is an area ripe with potential for 2025 and beyond. But along with widespread adoption comes the potential for unintended consequences and significant environmental impact. There’s growing awareness of the need for sustainable innovations and AI models. Healthcare systems are now questioning how AI may be adding to their carbon footprints, while developers are concerned about improving the sustainability of the models. Why? Because digital solutions need significant energy and materials to generate, process and store data, along with water to cool heat-intensive data centers – all contributing to healthcare’s carbon footprint. In fact, the energy consumption of AI is increasing annually between 26% and 36%, and the power usage of data centers could triple within four years [7]. E-waste is another major issue to consider. Generative AI is also expected to generate up to 2.5 million tons of e-waste by 2030 [8]. As we digitalize healthcare, companies are recognizing that managing and minimizing the energy, material and water needs for AI will be essential to ensure the least impact on the environment.\nThe vast majority of healthcare’s carbon footprint – 71% – comes from supply chains through the production, transport and disposal of goods and services [9]. In fact, reducing these Scope 3 emissions is expected to have seven times more impact than just lowering a company’s own emissions. Healthcare organizations are increasingly recognizing the importance of addressing supply chain emissions not just for upcoming government regulations and reducing overall environmental impact, but also for their own financial performance. They are teaming up with partners throughout their value chains to drive change. Greater transparency and sustainable decision-making are already becoming major considerations in supply chains, from circular product design to collaborations with suppliers. According to the 2024 Future Health Index report, over the next three years, 41% of healthcare leaders plan to choose suppliers with sustainable targets and initiatives, and an equal percentage plan to implement sustainable procurement strategies, including circular equipment. Some companies like Philips are working directly with their suppliers to ensure they meet environmental standards and adopt sustainable practices. This type of responsible sourcing of goods and services can have a positive ripple effect within the entire healthcare value chain. Meanwhile, adopting circular practices, which emphasize using less, using longer, and using again, is another way that both healthcare organizations and their suppliers are significantly reducing raw material usage and waste. Refurbishment is one example. Both refurbished consumer products and refurbished medical devices, including image-guided therapy systems and MRI scanners, offer sustainable and cost-efficient alternatives without compromising performance. The refurbished medical devices market is expected to grow from $17.05 billion in 2024 to $30.78 billion by 2029 [10]. By embracing collaborative efforts, healthcare organizations can significantly reduce their environmental impact.\nAs climate change poses increasingly significant challenges, there is an urgent need for hospitals and healthcare systems to enhance their preparedness. The World Health Organization reports that climate change is already impacting health in many ways, including death and illnesses from heat waves, drought, floods, air pollution, wildfires and more [11]. Many healthcare facilities see increasing numbers of patients with climate-related health issues, yet not all are prepared to care for the influx. Issues extend beyond patient care – healthcare must also consider the impact on their own operations and facilities. In 2025, as the global conversation turns toward this topic, we expect that healthcare technology will play an important role in ensuring that the healthcare industry is equipped to handle these growing challenges. One way is through developing resilient infrastructure to ensure continuous and effective healthcare delivery, even in the face of climate disasters. This includes transitioning healthcare facilities to renewable energy sources and implementing sustainable practices to reduce their carbon footprint and operational costs. There are also opportunities for increased training and education programs to equip healthcare providers with the knowledge and skills needed to manage the influx of heat-related illnesses and vector-borne diseases. Additionally, early warning systems could enable prompt responses to minimize health risks, and strengthening community health programs can help improve preventive care and manage climate-sensitive health conditions at the local level. By embracing such initiatives, the healthcare industry can better adapt to the impacts of climate change and ensure a healthier future for all.\nSources [1] https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacc.2022.04.042 [2] https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK562154/ [3] https://hbr.org/2022/05/the-telehealth-era-is-just-beginning [4] Philips Pregnancy+ user survey, 2022 [5] Philips Pregnancy+ parents survey conducted by InSights Consulting, November 2022 [6] https://noharm-global.org/documents/health-care-climate-footprint-report [8] https://www.nature.com/articles/s43588-024-00712-6 [9] https://noharm-global.org/documents/health-care-climate-footprint-report [11] https://www.who.int/news/item/02-11-2023-climate-change-and-noncommunicable-diseases-connections", "select_response": "<think>\nThe webpage provides an overview of 10 healthcare technology trends anticipated for 2025, discussing various innovations and their implications for healthcare, including generative AI, its integration in critical areas like cardiac care, remote patient monitoring, and advancements in medical imaging.

Our recent AI breakthroughs provide unprecedented opportunities to make healthcare more accessible, personalized and effective for everyone, and to significantly accelerate scientific discovery. Here’s an update on our progress, how we’re collaborating with partners to bring AI to global healthcare settings and our recently announced AI co-scientist.\nAI is making accurate health information more accessible\nGoogle is often the first place people turn to when they are looking for answers to health-related questions, so we strive to make sure everyone has access to relevant, high-quality health information in their moment of need. Using Lens, people can take a picture to search skin conditions that are visually similar to what they see on their own skin, and on YouTube, we piloted AI tools with health creators and organizations like Cleveland Clinic to make it easier for them to publish authoritative, high-quality content.\nFor care providers, we launched MedLM and Search for Healthcare which can provide answers to medical questions. These are available on the Google Cloud Vertex AI platform, helping clinicians make more informed decisions and helping patients receive the precise care they need. Our research into medical factuality ensures that health-related content generated by language models is as reliable and grounded in factual sources as possible.\nGenerative AI is paving the way for personalized healthcare\nWith advancements in multimodality and conversational AI, we’re able to reimagine patient care and how it could be personalized for everyone, with an emphasis on preventive healthcare.\nFrom X-rays to digital health records, medicine is multimodal. Building on our MedLM research, we developed Med-Gemini, next-generation models for healthcare which have Gemini’s superior multimodal and reasoning capabilities and are fine-tuned on de-identified medical data. In published research, Med-Gemini achieved 91.1% accuracy on U.S. medical exam-style questions, and we demonstrated how the models can effectively interpret 3D scans or answer complex clinical questions.\nWe’re researching how AI systems could serve as conversational diagnostic partners in clinical settings, using Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer (AMIE), a research AI system optimized for diagnostic reasoning and conversations. It is designed to take a “clinical history” and ask intelligent questions to help derive a differential diagnosis and handle discussions with empathy, including in subspecialist domains.\nMobile and wearable devices are another promising area where generative AI models could provide personalized insights for both healthcare and wellness, using data such as step count and heart rate. We designed the Personal Health Large Language Model, another fine-tuned version of Gemini, which can interpret sensor data and generate insights and recommendations about an individual’s sleep and fitness patterns.\nAI is improving health outcomes globally\nEarly diagnosis of disease is critical for improving health outcomes. Over the past decade, we’ve tapped into AI’s imaging and diagnostic capabilities and developed AI models to help detect diseases including breast cancer, lung cancer and diabetic retinopathy. Through partnerships, we’re now bringing these solutions at scale to clinical settings so that more patients can benefit from timely and accurate screenings. The impact is particularly profound in low-resource medical settings and countries with fewer specialist doctors per capita. Over the next decade, our health-tech partners in India and Thailand aim to deliver 6 million diabetic retinopathy screenings at no cost to patients, and Apollo Radiology International will build on our AI models to provide 3 million free screenings across India for tuberculosis, lung cancer and breast cancer. Adding to our various initiatives to address maternal health in Africa, we’re also developing an ML model for cardiotocography, used to predict fetal well-being, and exploring its utility in medical settings with limited resources.\nWe’re also laying the technological foundations for broader access to healthcare. Our Health AI Developer Foundations include open-weight models and resources to help developers build AI models for healthcare more efficiently. And solutions powered by our Open Health Stack (OHS) — a suite of open-source tools that makes it easier for developers to create next-gen digital health solutions for healthcare workers — have already been deployed across regions in Africa, South Asia and Southeast Asia to support frontline healthcare workers serving millions of patients.\nAI is accelerating scientific discovery\nMedicine is rooted in science. Building on AI’s ability to synthesize information and perform complex reasoning tasks, we’re exploring how it could augment scientific and biomedical discovery through our work on AI co-scientist, a multi-agent AI system based on Gemini 2.0. AI co-scientist is designed to function as a collaborative tool for scientists. It’s intended to uncover new, original knowledge and help scientists formulate novel research hypotheses and proposals, building upon prior evidence and tailored to specific research objectives. It has already demonstrated potential in areas such as drug repurposing for acute myeloid leukemia, proposing hypotheses for novel treatment targets for liver fibrosis and explaining mechanisms of horizontal gene transfer underlying antimicrobial resistance — each of which is a complex application and presents a different set of challenges.\nWe continue to realize the incredible potential of AI to advance science and improve, personalize and democratize access to healthcare. The “magic cycle” where we achieve research breakthroughs and translate them to real world impact is accelerating and expanding in scope. We’ll pursue this opportunity responsibly, in collaboration with global partners, and continue to share our research — in 2024, we published more than 50 papers in which we shared cutting-edge health research, and we recently shared our 2025 Health Impact Report. Ultimately, we believe AI will continue to help advance healthcare and science for the benefit of billions of people.", "select_response": "<think>\nThe webpage discusses Google's research and initiatives focused on advancing healthcare through AI, highlighting various tools and applications that aim to make healthcare more effective and accessible.

But how do chatbots do when guiding treatment and care after the diagnosis? For example, how long before surgery should a patient stop taking prescribed blood thinners? Should a patient’s treatment protocol change if they’ve had adverse reactions to similar drugs in the past? These sorts of questions don’t have a textbook right or wrong answer — it’s up to physicians to use their judgment.\nJonathan H. Chen, MD, PhD, assistant professor of medicine, and a team of researchers are exploring whether chatbots, a type of large language model, or LLM, can effectively answer such nuanced questions, and whether physicians supported by chatbots perform better.\nThe answers, it turns out, are yes and yes. The research team tested how a chatbot performed when faced with a variety of clinical crossroads. A chatbot on its own outperformed doctors who could access only an internet search and medical references, but armed with their own LLM, the doctors, from multiple regions and institutions across the United States, kept up with the chatbots.\n“For years I’ve said that, when combined, human plus computer is going to do better than either one by itself,” Chen said. “I think this study challenges us to think about that more critically and ask ourselves, ‘What is a computer good at? What is a human good at?’ We may need to rethink where we use and combine those skills and for which tasks we recruit AI.”\nA study detailing these results published in Nature Medicine on Feb. 5. Chen and Adam Rodman, MD, assistant professor at Harvard University, are co-senior authors. Postdoctoral scholars Ethan Goh, MD, and Robert Gallo, MD, are co-lead author.\nBoosted by chatbots\nIn October 2024, Chen and Goh led a team that ran a study, published in JAMA Network Open, that tested how the chatbot performed when diagnosing diseases and that found its accuracy was higher than that of doctors, even if they were using a chatbot. The current paper digs into the squishier side of medicine, evaluating chatbot and physician performance on questions that fall into a category called “clinical management reasoning.”\nGoh explains the difference like this: Imagine you’re using a map app on your phone to guide you to a certain destination. Using an LLM to diagnose a disease is sort of like using the map to pinpoint the correct location. How you get there is the management reasoning part — do you take backroads because there’s traffic? Stay the course, bumper to bumper? Or wait and hope the roads clear up?\nIn a medical context, these decisions can get tricky. Say a doctor incidentally discovers a hospitalized patient has a sizeable mass in the upper part of the lung. What would the next steps be? The doctor (or chatbot) should recognize that a large nodule in the upper lobe of the lung statistically has a high chance of spreading throughout the body. The doctor could immediately take a biopsy of the mass, schedule the procedure for a later date or order imaging to try to learn more.\nDetermining which approach is best suited for the patient comes down to a host of details, starting with the patient’s known preferences. Are they reticent to undergo an invasive procedure? Does the patient’s history show a lack of following up on appointments? Is the hospital’s health system reliable when organizing follow-up appointments? What about referrals? These types of contextual factors are crucial to consider, Chen said.\nThe team designed a trial to study clinical management reasoning performance in three groups: the chatbot alone, 46 doctors with chatbot support, and 46 doctors with access only to internet search and medical references. They selected five de-identified patient cases and gave them to the chatbot and to the doctors, all of whom provided a written response that detailed what they would do in each case, why and what they considered when making the decision.\nIn addition, the researchers tapped a group of board-certified doctors to create a rubric that would qualify a medical judgment or decision as appropriately assessed. The decisions were then scored against the rubric.\nTo the team’s surprise, the chatbot outperformed the doctors who had access only to the internet and medical references, ticking more items on the rubric than the doctors did. But the doctors who were paired with a chatbot performed as well as the chatbot alone.\nA future of chatbot doctors?\nExactly what gave the physician-chatbot collaboration a boost is up for debate. Does using the LLM force doctors to be more thoughtful about the case? Or is the LLM providing guidance that the doctors wouldn’t have thought of on their own? It’s a future direction of exploration, Chen said.\nThe positive outcomes for chatbots and physicians paired with chatbots beg an ever-popular question: Are AI doctors on their way?\n“Perhaps it’s a point in AI’s favor,” Chen said. But rather than replacing physicians, the results suggest that doctors might want to welcome a chatbot assist. “This doesn’t mean patients should skip the doctor and go straight to chatbots. Don’t do that,” he said. “There’s a lot of good information out there, but there’s also bad information. The skill we all have to develop is discerning what’s credible and what’s not right. That’s more important now than ever.”\nResearchers from VA Palo Alto Health Care System, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard University, University of Minnesota, University of Virginia, Microsoft and Kaiser contributed to this work.\nThe study was funded by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, the Stanford Clinical Excellence Research Center and the VA Advanced Fellowship in Medical Informatics.\nStanford’s Department of Medicine also supported the work.", "select_response": "<think>\nThe webpage discusses the performance of AI chatbots in assisting physicians with diagnosing diseases and managing treatment decisions.

Here’s what to expect in 2025.\nContent: From Point Solutions to Operational Transformation\n\"We're witnessing a fundamental shift in how AI is deployed in healthcare,\" explains Neil Patel, Head of Ventures. \"The technology is moving beyond basic automation toward truly autonomous systems capable of handling complex operational workflows end-to-end. What's particularly exciting is how voice AI is evolving to support natural clinician-patient conversations while simultaneously managing documentation and providing real-time clinical decision support.\"\nThis evolution is particularly evident in how data is being integrated and utilized. Multiple streams of information – imaging, lab results, patient history, and real-time monitoring – are being unified into cohesive systems that drive more informed clinical decisions.\nLindsey Rogers, Director of New Ventures, has observed a significant expansion in AI applications beyond traditional use cases. \"Early adopters focused on obvious opportunities like call center optimization and scheduling,\" she notes. \"But in 2025, we're seeing entirely new applications emerge. Companies are using AI to evaluate the robustness of clinical studies, predict hospital supply chain needs with unprecedented accuracy, and provide practice owners with sophisticated operational insights drawn from vast amounts of previously unstructured data.\"\n\"We're witnessing a fundamental shift in how AI is deployed in healthcare.\"\nThe Changing Investment Landscape\nThe venture landscape in healthcare is experiencing a notable shift. \"Traditional venture firms are becoming increasingly selective about early-stage investments,\" Patel observes. \"They're focusing primarily on AI-enabled companies that can demonstrate immediate impact, while specialist healthcare funds are emerging as the primary backers of tech-enabled services companies.\"\nThis bifurcation is creating fascinating market dynamics. Early-stage companies leveraging AI are achieving significant milestones with far less capital than their predecessors. Meanwhile, Rogers points out a crucial challenge facing established players: \"Incumbent and later-stage companies with significant technical debt – sophisticated technology stacks not designed to be AI-native – are beginning to lose major business to earlier stage competitors who can offer more customized solutions at better price points.\"\nWorkforce Innovation and Clinical Impact\nThe healthcare workforce is undergoing its own revolution. Ryan Schneiter, Managing Director of New Ventures, sees AI technology reshaping how risk-bearing providers approach health outcomes. \"We're seeing providers leverage AI for better risk stratification, improved preventative clinical interventions, and enhanced physician productivity,\" he explains. \"The technology is moving beyond simple task automation to fundamentally changing how clinical teams operate.\"\nThe financial implications are significant, particularly in Revenue Cycle Management. \"The true ROI breakthrough lies in AI-driven tools that streamline billing, claims processing, and documentation verification,\" Patel notes. \"Health systems with significant operational expenses in clinical and non-clinical labor stand to gain substantially from AI adoption, both for productivity gains and, where appropriate, labor optimization.\"\nRegulatory Considerations\nAs AI becomes more deeply integrated into care delivery and clinical decision support, new challenges are emerging. \"Software-as-a-medical-device requirements have come into increased focus,\" Schneiter emphasizes. \"These requirements will continue to shape how companies approach building AI products and solutions, adding an important layer of complexity to innovation in this space.\"\nLooking Ahead\nAs we move into 2025, the focus will be on meaningful integration of these emerging technologies. Rogers is particularly optimistic about new opportunities: \"As founders and investors better understand AI's capabilities, we expect to see AI enter new healthcare markets with novel offerings while creating new opportunities in traditional sectors where innovation had reached a ceiling without large language models.\"\nThe challenge for healthcare organizations won't be finding AI solutions – it will be selecting the right ones and implementing them effectively. \"Success will require not just technological adoption but thoughtful integration that considers workforce impact, clinical workflows, and patient outcomes,\" Patel explains. \"The organizations that succeed will be those that can navigate this transformation while keeping sight of healthcare's fundamental mission: improving patient outcomes and expanding access to care.\"\nWe continue to be excited by the opportunities ahead and look forward to partnering with innovative companies that are thoughtfully approaching these challenges.", "select_response": "<think>\nThe purpose of this search round is to gather information on recent AI collaborations, emerging AI applications in healthcare, recent technological improvements, and significant research initiatives in the context of the Stanford-Mayo partnership.

A new collaboration with the Mayo Clinic brings physician team — and married couple — Chieh-Ju Chao and Chia-Chun Chiang to the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI (HAI) to learn how to bridge the gap.\nImproving Treatment for Migraine Patients\nAt the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, Chia-Chun Chiang splits her medical practice between treating patients who’ve suffered acute stroke and migraine sufferers who come to her to seek help with the intense headaches that can sometimes incapacitate them for weeks, months, or longer. Chiang, a specialist in headache medicine and vascular neurology, not only hopes to improve these daily realities for her patients but also wants to explore how AI may someday lead to better overall treatment through exciting new breakthroughs.\nFor the next year, Chiang will be a visiting scholar at Stanford HAI, where she’s exploring the intersection of AI and neurology. The appointment is part of a new collaborative program between HAI and the Mayo Clinic and will give Chiang a chance to do what she’s always loved — find innovative solutions to challenging medical questions.\nBorn in Taiwan, Chiang found her medical horizons were expanded early in her career, both by her neurosurgeon father and a series of influential mentors on two continents.\n“My father always encouraged me to think not just about day-to-day realities in medical practice but about making research breakthroughs in medicine — about discovery,” she says. “Arthur Chiou, a professor of biophotonics at National Yang Ming University, opened a window for me to see different types of medical research. Later, I came to the University of California, San Diego, and met Professor Shu Chien in the department of bioengineering. He got me into the world of using math and physics to solve medical research problems. It was inspiring.”\nChiang’s time at Stanford HAI will be spent on several research projects focusing on her special interest in migraine and stroke. She hopes to use AI to help doctors determine which of many preventive migraine medications might help chronic migraine sufferers — those experiencing migraine attacks more than 15 days per month — stave off debilitating attacks.\n“Right now there’s no way to predict if a patient will respond to medication A, B, C, D, or E,” she says. “It’s a trial-and-error process, where we start with one medication and wait three months to see if it helps. This can be a long time and a long process when you’re in pain. I’m hoping to be able to apply advanced machine learning technologies to the Mayo Clinic’s established headache database to help predict good matches or to develop personalized treatment plans for patients with migraine.”\nChiang is also collaborating with Nigam Shah, a Stanford professor of medicine and chief data scientist for Stanford Health Care, to be able to more effectively utilize all of a patient’s electronic health record data to understand which migraine patients might be at risk of stroke and cardiovascular disease.\n“Things like clinician notes, consultations, and admission notes are written in free text, which traditionally have been hard for data scientists to access,” she says. “Dr. Shah’s lab has developed several advanced machine learning tools tailored to health care notes that can extract and use this sort of information. We hope to be able to apply these tools to databases at the Mayo Clinic and at Stanford to give us some solid research results from two different health care systems.”\nChiang says AI is changing the field of neurology through innovations such as telemedicine and AI-assisted CT analysis, both of which benefit stroke patients, particularly those in isolated regions of the country where small hospitals may not have neurologists on staff. Continuing the introduction of relevant and user-friendly technology into health care, however, will require improved communication between those who develop AI and those who treat patients.\n“I’m very excited about the use of AI in my field, which is why I wanted to come to HAI and contribute to this process by stimulating more discussion and work between data scientists and clinicians,” she says. “I see patients who are suffering every day in clinic. It’s crucial for us to continue imagining how AI tools can be developed to improve their quality of life.”\nDeveloping Better Tools for Echocardiography\nMayo Clinic cardiologist Chieh-Ju Chao was a teenager in Taiwan when the college entrance exam set him on a trajectory to medical school. Deep down, though, the 18-year-old harbored a secret ambition.\n“I was happy to go into medicine, but I always loved physics,” he says. “It was always in the back of my mind. I love the beauty of the laws and formulas in physics and, as a kid, I dreamed of being the next Einstein or Feynman.” After medical school, Chao took postgraduate physics courses in Taiwan before becoming a postdoctoral fellow at UC San Diego, where he led a research project to build a 3D dynamic heart model. He began to see intersections between physics and medicine, particularly in the field of cardiology. “It was one of the most important periods of my life and one that really changed my career path,” he says.\nFor the next year, Chao will have a chance to deeply explore his interdisciplinary interests, as a visiting scholar at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence. As part of a collaborative program between Stanford HAI and the Mayo Clinic, facilitated and guided by HAI Co-Director Fei-Fei Li, Chao will expand his current research on the potential use of AI technology to augment echocardiography, which harnesses ultrasound waves to examine the anatomy and dynamics of the heart. Chao hopes his dual background in medicine and technology will allow him to bridge the knowledge gap that often exists between health care and technology professionals and to accelerate the expansion of AI systems into clinical medicine at the Mayo Clinic and elsewhere.\n“The usual pathway for this has always been for clinicians to come up with an idea, then talk to AI engineers,” he says. “But that process can take a long time because communication between the two disciplines is not easy. For the first time, this program between Mayo and HAI sends clinicians out into the AI field to learn some of these skills and take them back. I knew this was something I wanted to do. I see myself as a person who will be able to speak both languages.”\nAt the Mayo Clinic, Chao studies how AI models might be used to solve clinical questions, such as how to classify different grades of cardiac diastolic dysfunction, which occur when the heart’s damaged ventricles are unable to completely fill with blood. (That work, in fact, resulted in Chao being named a “Young Investigator Award” finalist at the 2022 American College of Cardiology Conference.)\nAt Stanford HAI, he’ll focus on two primary research projects. The first will incorporate the use of AI to give cardiologists a more realistic view of the heart during procedures such as aortic and mitral valve replacements, which are often done with the use of catheters rather than open-heart surgery. Positioning these catheters currently relies on the 2D images provided by echocardiogram and X-ray. Chao envisions AI models that might be able to compile that information with CT images of the patient’s heart, giving doctors a real-time 3D and even hologram-based picture that would make the procedure smoother and more efficient.\n“Our goal is to improve success rates, minimize complications, and lessen radiation exposure through shorter procedures,” Chao says. “It could potentially shorten procedure times from five or six hours to two or three and allow a more efficient use of our procedure room resources.”\nSecondly, Chao will explore the potential use of AI visual linguistic models to generate time-consuming echocardiography reports more efficiently. Ideally, the model would have the capacity to do an initial interpretation of the study and generate a preliminary report that could then be reviewed by clinicians.\n“This would be an advancement in current AI application in the medical field,” Chao says. “People have been trying to create systems that can report on chest X-rays, which are a single image. In an echo study, we’re dealing with video clips that record the cardiac dynamics from different views. It’s an even more exciting challenge.”\nChao says he’s motivated both by colleagues at the Mayo Clinic who are enthusiastic about this work as well as the range of scholars and technical resources he’s finding at Stanford HAI.\n“It’s amazing to work with cutting-edge AI scientists and the latest technology,” he says. “Talking about my clinical ideas with colleagues here in this setting is a very different and immersive learning experience for me, and these conversations are generating new ideas as I learn about what people are doing here and about potential applications I hadn’t thought about. It’s all really exciting.”\nStanford HAI’s mission is to advance AI research, education, policy and practice to improve the human condition.

But how do leading institutions like the Mayo Clinic turn AI’s potential into real-world impact? With a strategic approach and a commitment to responsible innovation, Mayo Clinic is setting a new benchmark for how AI can enhance patient care and streamline medical workflows.\nKey speakers\n- Moderator: Gabriel Perna, Modern Healthcare’s Digital Health Editor\n- Speaker: Cris Ross, Mayo Clinic’s Former CIO\nThese insights came from our ScaleUp:AI event in November 2024, an industry-leading global conference that features topics across technologies and industries. Watch the full session below:\nKey takeaways\n- Workforce shortages: AI can help alleviate the strain by automating tasks and improving efficiency.\n- Data complexity: Healthcare generates about 30% of the world’s data, growing at an annual rate of 36%. AI helps structure this data for quality management, reimbursement, and research.\n- Patient experience: AI tools are being deployed to improve patient interactions, such as summarizing doctor visits for stressed patients who might struggle to retain information.\n- Access, affordability, and quality: AI can optimize medical workflows, reducing avoidable medical injuries and improving treatment quality.\n- Cures for complex diseases: AI is already making strides in accelerating diagnostics and treatment strategies for conditions such as atrial fibrillation and cancer.\nAddressing healthcare challenges with AI\nWorkforce shortages and data complexity\nThe healthcare industry is facing a generational shortage of professionals, which poses significant challenges for patient care. Ross emphasized that AI can help bridge this gap by taking on administrative and repetitive tasks, allowing medical professionals to focus on patient interactions and complex decision-making.\n“We have a generational shortage of healthcare professionals.”\n“We have a generational shortage of healthcare professionals,” Ross explained. “AI has some challenges in other industries from an ethical perspective on reduction in jobs, but look, if it can do the jobs of people in healthcare, it’s a hero job.”\nAt the same time, healthcare is one of the most data-intensive industries, with an estimated 30% of the world’s healthcare-related data. This data grows at a staggering 36% annual rate, presenting both challenges and opportunities for AI.\n“Doctors want to have conversations with patients,” Ross said. “So what can we do to improve the patient experience by using AI tools to be explainers, so patients can ask questions of a record and have a computer answer in a sensible way, where doctors don’t have time to answer those questions.”\nEnhancing patient experience and healthcare accessibility\nThe stress and confusion that often accompany medical visits make it difficult for patients to absorb and retain crucial health information. AI tools can improve patient experiences by summarizing doctor visits and providing personalized explanations.\nAdditionally, quality healthcare remains out of reach for many due to accessibility and affordability issues. AI is being used to improve workflow efficiencies, streamline diagnoses, and enhance decision-making to reduce costs and increase care quality.\n“We still have tens of thousands of people who are injured every year in the U.S. from medical injury that’s avoidable. So there’s all sorts of things we can do to improve.” Ross noted. AI can help reduce these errors, ensure more efficient triage, and make scheduling and operational management more effective.\nAdvancing treatments and accelerating disease detection\nAI is accelerating disease detection and treatment breakthroughs, particularly in areas like arrhythmia detection, cancer treatment, and transplant matching.\n“Some of the stuff that we’ve done in Mayo is, for instance, detection of arrhythmias,” Ross explained. “We’re at the point where the rhythms can be detected on a single lead ECG, meaning something that can be in an Apple watch or some other device. From that, we can both diagnose arrhythmias and treat them. So when a patient goes into arrhythmia, you can take interventions to get them back into rhythm.”\nHe also highlighted Mayo Clinic’s work with Google on radiotherapy optimization: “We worked with Google to develop algorithms to do better radiotherapy treatment of disease, and we started with head and neck cancers.” With AI-powered radiotherapy, AI can maximize tumor targeting while minimizing damage to surrounding tissue, potentially transforming cancer treatment outcomes.\nAI at scale: Mayo Clinic’s enterprise-wide approach\nUnlike many healthcare institutions that focus on isolated AI projects, Mayo Clinic has developed an enterprise-wide AI strategy:\nData consolidation: Over a decade, Mayo Clinic unified its electronic health records into a single system, creating a comprehensive, structured patient database.\nAI factory: Hosted on Google Cloud’s Vertex AI, Mayo Clinic’s AI factory supports over 250 AI research and deployment projects, integrating models with real-time patient data.\nCloud app factory: Ensuring AI models can be deployed efficiently within workflows, bridging the gap between innovation and clinical application.\n“We have two jobs: One is to support technology for the world’s best hospital. The second is to innovate at Silicon Valley speed and put solutions into production.”\n“We have two jobs,” Ross explained. “One is to support technology for the world’s best hospital. The second is to innovate at Silicon Valley speed and put solutions into production.”\n“We need to go as fast as we can, but no faster than is safe”\nAs AI adoption grows, Ross urged the industry to focus on the five core challenges he outlined. Looking ahead, he sees a future where startups, research institutions, and cloud platforms collaborate to create transformative healthcare solutions.\n“We need to go as fast as we can, but no faster than is safe,” he concluded, reinforcing the importance of responsible AI deployment in healthcare.\nWith AI-driven solutions already improving diagnosis, treatment, and patient care, Mayo Clinic’s work serves as a blueprint for the future of AI in medicine.\nWatch more sessions from ScaleUp:AI, and see scaleup.events for updates on ScaleUp:AI 2025.", "select_response": "<think>\nThe webpage discusses how the Mayo Clinic is utilizing AI to transform healthcare, touching on various applications and strategies but does not provide specific information regarding the Stanford-Mayo partnership, nor does it detail migraine prediction capabilities or provide concrete timelines for technology implementation.

A new collaboration with the Mayo Clinic brings physician team — and married couple — Chieh-Ju Chao and Chia-Chun Chiang to the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI (HAI) to learn how to bridge the gap.\nImproving Treatment for Migraine Patients\nAt the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, Chia-Chun Chiang splits her medical practice between treating patients who’ve suffered acute stroke and migraine sufferers who come to her to seek help with the intense headaches that can sometimes incapacitate them for weeks, months, or longer. Chiang, a specialist in headache medicine and vascular neurology, not only hopes to improve these daily realities for her patients but also wants to explore how AI may someday lead to better overall treatment through exciting new breakthroughs.\nFor the next year, Chiang will be a visiting scholar at Stanford HAI, where she’s exploring the intersection of AI and neurology. The appointment is part of a new collaborative program between HAI and the Mayo Clinic and will give Chiang a chance to do what she’s always loved — find innovative solutions to challenging medical questions.\nBorn in Taiwan, Chiang found her medical horizons were expanded early in her career, both by her neurosurgeon father and a series of influential mentors on two continents.\n“My father always encouraged me to think not just about day-to-day realities in medical practice but about making research breakthroughs in medicine — about discovery,” she says. “Arthur Chiou, a professor of biophotonics at National Yang Ming University, opened a window for me to see different types of medical research. Later, I came to the University of California, San Diego, and met Professor Shu Chien in the department of bioengineering. He got me into the world of using math and physics to solve medical research problems. It was inspiring.”\nChiang’s time at Stanford HAI will be spent on several research projects focusing on her special interest in migraine and stroke. She hopes to use AI to help doctors determine which of many preventive migraine medications might help chronic migraine sufferers — those experiencing migraine attacks more than 15 days per month — stave off debilitating attacks.\n“Right now there’s no way to predict if a patient will respond to medication A, B, C, D, or E,” she says. “It’s a trial-and-error process, where we start with one medication and wait three months to see if it helps. This can be a long time and a long process when you’re in pain. I’m hoping to be able to apply advanced machine learning technologies to the Mayo Clinic’s established headache database to help predict good matches or to develop personalized treatment plans for patients with migraine.”\nChiang is also collaborating with Nigam Shah, a Stanford professor of medicine and chief data scientist for Stanford Health Care, to be able to more effectively utilize all of a patient’s electronic health record data to understand which migraine patients might be at risk of stroke and cardiovascular disease.\n“Things like clinician notes, consultations, and admission notes are written in free text, which traditionally have been hard for data scientists to access,” she says. “Dr. Shah’s lab has developed several advanced machine learning tools tailored to health care notes that can extract and use this sort of information. We hope to be able to apply these tools to databases at the Mayo Clinic and at Stanford to give us some solid research results from two different health care systems.”\nChiang says AI is changing the field of neurology through innovations such as telemedicine and AI-assisted CT analysis, both of which benefit stroke patients, particularly those in isolated regions of the country where small hospitals may not have neurologists on staff. Continuing the introduction of relevant and user-friendly technology into health care, however, will require improved communication between those who develop AI and those who treat patients.\n“I’m very excited about the use of AI in my field, which is why I wanted to come to HAI and contribute to this process by stimulating more discussion and work between data scientists and clinicians,” she says. “I see patients who are suffering every day in clinic. It’s crucial for us to continue imagining how AI tools can be developed to improve their quality of life.”\nDeveloping Better Tools for Echocardiography\nMayo Clinic cardiologist Chieh-Ju Chao was a teenager in Taiwan when the college entrance exam set him on a trajectory to medical school. Deep down, though, the 18-year-old harbored a secret ambition.\n“I was happy to go into medicine, but I always loved physics,” he says. “It was always in the back of my mind. I love the beauty of the laws and formulas in physics and, as a kid, I dreamed of being the next Einstein or Feynman.” After medical school, Chao took postgraduate physics courses in Taiwan before becoming a postdoctoral fellow at UC San Diego, where he led a research project to build a 3D dynamic heart model. He began to see intersections between physics and medicine, particularly in the field of cardiology. “It was one of the most important periods of my life and one that really changed my career path,” he says.\nFor the next year, Chao will have a chance to deeply explore his interdisciplinary interests, as a visiting scholar at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence. As part of a collaborative program between Stanford HAI and the Mayo Clinic, facilitated and guided by HAI Co-Director Fei-Fei Li, Chao will expand his current research on the potential use of AI technology to augment echocardiography, which harnesses ultrasound waves to examine the anatomy and dynamics of the heart. Chao hopes his dual background in medicine and technology will allow him to bridge the knowledge gap that often exists between health care and technology professionals and to accelerate the expansion of AI systems into clinical medicine at the Mayo Clinic and elsewhere.\n“The usual pathway for this has always been for clinicians to come up with an idea, then talk to AI engineers,” he says. “But that process can take a long time because communication between the two disciplines is not easy. For the first time, this program between Mayo and HAI sends clinicians out into the AI field to learn some of these skills and take them back. I knew this was something I wanted to do. I see myself as a person who will be able to speak both languages.”\nAt the Mayo Clinic, Chao studies how AI models might be used to solve clinical questions, such as how to classify different grades of cardiac diastolic dysfunction, which occur when the heart’s damaged ventricles are unable to completely fill with blood. (That work, in fact, resulted in Chao being named a “Young Investigator Award” finalist at the 2022 American College of Cardiology Conference.)\nAt Stanford HAI, he’ll focus on two primary research projects. The first will incorporate the use of AI to give cardiologists a more realistic view of the heart during procedures such as aortic and mitral valve replacements, which are often done with the use of catheters rather than open-heart surgery. Positioning these catheters currently relies on the 2D images provided by echocardiogram and X-ray. Chao envisions AI models that might be able to compile that information with CT images of the patient’s heart, giving doctors a real-time 3D and even hologram-based picture that would make the procedure smoother and more efficient.\n“Our goal is to improve success rates, minimize complications, and lessen radiation exposure through shorter procedures,” Chao says. “It could potentially shorten procedure times from five or six hours to two or three and allow a more efficient use of our procedure room resources.”\nSecondly, Chao will explore the potential use of AI visual linguistic models to generate time-consuming echocardiography reports more efficiently. Ideally, the model would have the capacity to do an initial interpretation of the study and generate a preliminary report that could then be reviewed by clinicians.\n“This would be an advancement in current AI application in the medical field,” Chao says. “People have been trying to create systems that can report on chest X-rays, which are a single image. In an echo study, we’re dealing with video clips that record the cardiac dynamics from different views. It’s an even more exciting challenge.”\nChao says he’s motivated both by colleagues at the Mayo Clinic who are enthusiastic about this work as well as the range of scholars and technical resources he’s finding at Stanford HAI.\n“It’s amazing to work with cutting-edge AI scientists and the latest technology,” he says. “Talking about my clinical ideas with colleagues here in this setting is a very different and immersive learning experience for me, and these conversations are generating new ideas as I learn about what people are doing here and about potential applications I hadn’t thought about. It’s all really exciting.”\nStanford HAI’s mission is to advance AI research, education, policy and practice to improve the human condition.

But how do leading institutions like the Mayo Clinic turn AI’s potential into real-world impact? With a strategic approach and a commitment to responsible innovation, Mayo Clinic is setting a new benchmark for how AI can enhance patient care and streamline medical workflows.\nKey speakers\n- Moderator: Gabriel Perna, Modern Healthcare’s Digital Health Editor\n- Speaker: Cris Ross, Mayo Clinic’s Former CIO\nThese insights came from our ScaleUp:AI event in November 2024, an industry-leading global conference that features topics across technologies and industries. Watch the full session below:\nKey takeaways\n- Workforce shortages: AI can help alleviate the strain by automating tasks and improving efficiency.\n- Data complexity: Healthcare generates about 30% of the world’s data, growing at an annual rate of 36%. AI helps structure this data for quality management, reimbursement, and research.\n- Patient experience: AI tools are being deployed to improve patient interactions, such as summarizing doctor visits for stressed patients who might struggle to retain information.\n- Access, affordability, and quality: AI can optimize medical workflows, reducing avoidable medical injuries and improving treatment quality.\n- Cures for complex diseases: AI is already making strides in accelerating diagnostics and treatment strategies for conditions such as atrial fibrillation and cancer.\nAddressing healthcare challenges with AI\nWorkforce shortages and data complexity\nThe healthcare industry is facing a generational shortage of professionals, which poses significant challenges for patient care. Ross emphasized that AI can help bridge this gap by taking on administrative and repetitive tasks, allowing medical professionals to focus on patient interactions and complex decision-making.\n“We have a generational shortage of healthcare professionals.”\n“We have a generational shortage of healthcare professionals,” Ross explained. “AI has some challenges in other industries from an ethical perspective on reduction in jobs, but look, if it can do the jobs of people in healthcare, it’s a hero job.”\nAt the same time, healthcare is one of the most data-intensive industries, with an estimated 30% of the world’s healthcare-related data. This data grows at a staggering 36% annual rate, presenting both challenges and opportunities for AI.\n“Doctors want to have conversations with patients,” Ross said. “So what can we do to improve the patient experience by using AI tools to be explainers, so patients can ask questions of a record and have a computer answer in a sensible way, where doctors don’t have time to answer those questions.”\nEnhancing patient experience and healthcare accessibility\nThe stress and confusion that often accompany medical visits make it difficult for patients to absorb and retain crucial health information. AI tools can improve patient experiences by summarizing doctor visits and providing personalized explanations.\nAdditionally, quality healthcare remains out of reach for many due to accessibility and affordability issues. AI is being used to improve workflow efficiencies, streamline diagnoses, and enhance decision-making to reduce costs and increase care quality.\n“We still have tens of thousands of people who are injured every year in the U.S. from medical injury that’s avoidable. So there’s all sorts of things we can do to improve.” Ross noted. AI can help reduce these errors, ensure more efficient triage, and make scheduling and operational management more effective.\nAdvancing treatments and accelerating disease detection\nAI is accelerating disease detection and treatment breakthroughs, particularly in areas like arrhythmia detection, cancer treatment, and transplant matching.\n“Some of the stuff that we’ve done in Mayo is, for instance, detection of arrhythmias,” Ross explained. “We’re at the point where the rhythms can be detected on a single lead ECG, meaning something that can be in an Apple watch or some other device. From that, we can both diagnose arrhythmias and treat them. So when a patient goes into arrhythmia, you can take interventions to get them back into rhythm.”\nHe also highlighted Mayo Clinic’s work with Google on radiotherapy optimization: “We worked with Google to develop algorithms to do better radiotherapy treatment of disease, and we started with head and neck cancers.” With AI-powered radiotherapy, AI can maximize tumor targeting while minimizing damage to surrounding tissue, potentially transforming cancer treatment outcomes.\nAI at scale: Mayo Clinic’s enterprise-wide approach\nUnlike many healthcare institutions that focus on isolated AI projects, Mayo Clinic has developed an enterprise-wide AI strategy:\nData consolidation: Over a decade, Mayo Clinic unified its electronic health records into a single system, creating a comprehensive, structured patient database.\nAI factory: Hosted on Google Cloud’s Vertex AI, Mayo Clinic’s AI factory supports over 250 AI research and deployment projects, integrating models with real-time patient data.\nCloud app factory: Ensuring AI models can be deployed efficiently within workflows, bridging the gap between innovation and clinical application.\n“We have two jobs: One is to support technology for the world’s best hospital. The second is to innovate at Silicon Valley speed and put solutions into production.”\n“We have two jobs,” Ross explained. “One is to support technology for the world’s best hospital. The second is to innovate at Silicon Valley speed and put solutions into production.”\n“We need to go as fast as we can, but no faster than is safe”\nAs AI adoption grows, Ross urged the industry to focus on the five core challenges he outlined. Looking ahead, he sees a future where startups, research institutions, and cloud platforms collaborate to create transformative healthcare solutions.\n“We need to go as fast as we can, but no faster than is safe,” he concluded, reinforcing the importance of responsible AI deployment in healthcare.\nWith AI-driven solutions already improving diagnosis, treatment, and patient care, Mayo Clinic’s work serves as a blueprint for the future of AI in medicine.\nWatch more sessions from ScaleUp:AI, and see scaleup.events for updates on ScaleUp:AI 2025.", "select_response": "<think>\nThe webpage discusses how the Mayo Clinic is utilizing AI to transform healthcare, touching on various applications and strategies but does not provide specific information regarding the Stanford-Mayo partnership, nor does it detail migraine prediction capabilities or provide concrete timelines for technology implementation.

Nearly 300 attendees from Mayo Clinic and other institutions gathered in person and virtually to discuss the challenges and opportunities in applying AI technology to healthcare.\n\"As we are entering the era of artificial intelligence, AI has great potential and is already playing a critical role in revolutionizing healthcare and biomedicine,\" said Cui Tao, Ph.D., chair of Mayo Clinic's Department of Artificial Intelligence and Informatics, in her opening remarks. Dr. Tao is the Nancy Peretsman and Robert Scully Chair of AI and Informatics.\n\"Our role as a Research shield enables us to lead innovation and discovery efforts within the AI medicine ecosystem,\" adds Dr. Tao. \"Through collaborative research, we aim to drive advancements to significantly enhance healthcare outcomes.\"\nAI integrates text, radiology images, digital pathology slides, genomics and other sources of information to assist care teams in defining disease and making predictive analyses to support clinical decision-making. This \"multimodal\" AI supports healthcare teams, enhancing their ability to develop innovative solutions and improve patient care.\nDeveloping models and bridging the AI translation gap\nJohn Halamka, M.D., the Dwight and Dian Diercks President of Mayo Clinic Platform and Michael D. Brennan, M.D., President's Strategic Initiative Professor, was a keynote speaker. He emphasized the need for AI solutions to address global healthcare challenges over the next 20 years.\n\"Culturally, I think we have an imperative to build these new solutions,\" he said, noting lower birthrates, higher longevity and higher demand for healthcare in many nations. Automation and AI, he explained, can be part of those solutions, enabling healthcare that is more proactive, less costly, less invasive and more focused on wellness and cures.\nTo create solutions that benefit global populations, AI developers need access to curated, de-identified data with depth, breadth and heterogeneity, said Dr. Halamka.\nMayo Clinic hosts the largest curated, de-identified dataset in the world, he said, representing 32.5 million patients and growing. Companies such as those participating in the Mayo Clinic Platform's Accelerator program can leverage this data within a secure cloud environment to develop AI models.\nOnce developed, these models must be validated, approved by regulatory bodies and implemented so that they are easy for clinicians to use.\n\"Handing a data model and an AI model to a physician is not going to get its use and impact. It has to be fully integrated into their workflow,\" Dr. Halamka said. \"It needs to be just-in-time, there offering appropriate advice without additional effort.\"\nGetting to patients more quickly\nOther headline speakers were Shauna Overgaard, Ph.D., senior director of AI Strategy and Frameworks, and co-director of the AI Validation and Stewardship Research Program at Mayo Clinic; Thomas Fuchs, D.Sc., dean of Artificial Intelligence and Human Health at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; Anant Madabhushi, Ph.D., executive director for the Emory University Empathetic AI for Health Institute; and Hoifung Poon, general manager at Microsoft Health Futures.\nIn her keynote, Dr. Overgaard discussed the \"AI translation gap\" between proof of concept and clinical implementation. The estimated time for translating a basic science discovery to clinical practice is 17 years, she noted. \"We know that as we work toward innovation, we absolutely cannot wait 17 years.\"\nTranslating AI solutions into patient care involves overcoming challenges such as gaining clinician trust, ensuring reliability through continuous scientific validation, securing payer approval, and meeting regulatory requirements. These efforts ensure that AI tools efficiently augment and enhance healthcare professionals' expertise and patient care practices.\n\"Part of our work is identifying potential barriers to AI translation and then working together to close those barriers as well as streamline innovation,\" she said. This will require scientific rigor and multidisciplinary teamwork. Dr. Overgaard said that a solid translational process should enable stakeholders by addressing transparency, reproducibility, ethics and effectiveness.

But a new study from Stanford Medicine shows the potential of AI as a facilitator - one that helps doctors and nurses connect to achieve more efficient, effective patient care.\nThe study, which published in JAMA Internal Medicine last month, describes an AI-based model in use at Stanford Hospital that predicts when a patient is declining and flags the patient's physicians and nurses. Ron Li, MD, a clinical associate professor of medicine and medical informatics director for digital health who is the senior author on the study, said the alert system helps clinicians connect more efficiently and effectively as well as intervene to prevent patients from deteriorating and landing in the intensive care unit.\nLi, who worked with informatics postdoctoral scholar and lead author Robert Gallo, MD, on the evaluation, discussed their team's approach to harnessing the algorithm and how it fosters clinician connection in a ceaselessly buzzing hospital environment. Lisa Shieh, MD, PhD, clinical professor of medicine; Margaret Smith, executive director of the Healthcare AI Applied Research Team, operations for primary care and population health; and Jerri Westphal, nursing informatics manager, also helped lead the study and the implementation of the AI system.\nRon Li\nWhat is a deterioration model and how does AI fit in?\nThe algorithm is a prediction model that pulls data - such as vital signs, information from electronic health records and lab results - in near-real time to predict whether a patient in the hospital is about to suffer a health decline. Physicians aren't able to monitor all of these data points for every patient all of the time, so the model runs in the background, looking at these values about every 15 minutes. It then uses artificial intelligence to calculate a risk score on the probability the patient is going to deteriorate, and if the patient seems like they might be declining, the model sends an alert to the care team.\nWhat's the benefit of having such a model run in a hospital?\nThe big question I want to answer is, \"How do we use AI to build a more resilient health system in high-stakes situations?\" There are many ways to do that, but one core characteristic for a resilient system is strong communication channels. This model is powered by AI, but the action it triggers, the intervention, is basically a conversation that otherwise may not have happened.\nNurses and physicians have conversations and handoffs when they change shifts, but it's difficult to standardize these communication channels due to busy schedules and other hospital dynamics. The algorithm can help standardize it and draw clinicians' attention to a patient who may need additional care. Once the alert comes into the nurse and physician simultaneously, it initiates a conversation about what the patient needs to ensure they don't decline to the point of requiring a transfer to the ICU.\nTell me about how your team implemented and evaluated the model.\nWe integrated this model, which we did not create, into our workflow, but with a few tweaks. Originally, it sent an alert when the patient was already deteriorating, which we didn't find very helpful. We adjusted the model to focus on predicting ICU transfers and other indicators of health decline.\nWe wanted to ensure the nursing team was heavily involved and felt empowered to initiate conversations with physicians about adjusting a patient's care. When we evaluated the tool, which we had running for almost 10,000 patients, we saw a significant improvement in clinical outcomes - a 10.4% decrease in deterioration events, which we defined as transfers to the ICU, rapid response team events, or codes - among a subset of 963 patients with risk scores within a \"regression discontinuity window,\" which basically means they're at the cusp of being high risk. These are patients whose clinical trajectory may not be as obvious to the medical team. For that group of patients, this model was especially helpful for encouraging physicians and nurses to collaborate to determine which patients need extra tending.\nHow have nurses and physicians responded to the integration of this new model?\nThe model is far from perfect. The reactions have overall been positive, but there is concern about alert fatigue, since not all alerts are flagging a real decline. When the model was validated on data from patients prior to implementation, we calculated that about 20% of patients flagged by the model did end up experiencing a deterioration event within six to 18 hours. At this point, even though it's not a completely accurate model, it's accurate enough to warrant a conversation. It shows that the algorithm doesn't have to be perfect for it to be effective.\nWith that said, we want to improve the accuracy; you need to do that to improve trust. That's what we're working on now.\nFor more news about responsible AI in health and medicine, sign up for the RAISE Health newsletter.\nRegister for the RAISE Health Symposium on May 14.", "select_response": "<think>\nThe webpage discusses a specific AI application from Stanford Medicine that improves collaboration between physicians and nurses by predicting patient deterioration.

In other words, machines can be given access to large amounts of information, and trained to solve problems, spot patterns and make recommendations. Common examples of AI in everyday life are virtual assistants like Alexa and Siri.\nWhat you might not know is that AI has been and is being used for a variety of healthcare applications. Here’s a look at how AI can be helpful in healthcare, and what to watch for as it evolves.\nWhat can AI technology in healthcare do for me?\nA report from the National Academy of Medicine identified three potential benefits of AI in healthcare: improving outcomes for both patients and clinical teams, lowering healthcare costs, and benefitting population health.\nFrom preventive screenings to diagnosis and treatment, AI is being used throughout the continuum of care today. Here are two examples:\nPreventive care\nCancer screenings that use radiology, like a mammogram or lung cancer screening, can leverage AI to help produce results faster.\nFor example, in polycystic kidney disease (PKD), researchers discovered that the size of the kidneys — specifically, an attribute known as total kidney volume — correlated with how rapidly kidney function was going to decline in the future.\nBut assessing total kidney volume, though incredibly informative, involves analyzing dozens of kidney images, one slide after another — a laborious process that can take about 45 minutes per patient. With the innovations developed at the PKD Center at Mayo Clinic, researchers now use artificial intelligence (AI) to automate the process, generating results in a matter of seconds.\nBradley J. Erickson, M.D., Ph.D., director of Mayo Clinic’s Radiology Informatics Lab, says that AI can complete time-consuming or mundane work for radiology professionals, like tracing tumors and structures, or measuring amounts of fat and muscle. “If a computer can do that first pass, that can help us a lot,” says Dr. Erickson.\nRisk assessment\nIn a Mayo Clinic cardiology study, AI successfully identified people at risk of left ventricular dysfunction, which is the medical name for a weak heart pump, even though the individuals had no noticeable symptoms. And that’s far from the only intersection of cardiology and AI.\n“We have an AI model now that can incidentally say, ‘Hey, you’ve got a lot of coronary artery calcium, and you’re at high risk for a heart attack or a stroke in five or 10 years,’ ” says Bhavik Patel, M.D., M.B.A., the chief artificial intelligence officer at Mayo Clinic in Arizona.\nHow can AI technology advance medicine and public health?\nWhen it comes to supporting the overall health of a population, AI can help people manage chronic illnesses themselves — think asthma, diabetes and high blood pressure — by connecting certain people with relevant screening and therapy, and reminding them to take steps in their care, such as take medication.\nAI also can help promote information on disease prevention online, reaching large numbers of people quickly, and even analyze text on social media to predict outbreaks. Considering the example of a widespread public health crisis, think of how these examples might have supported people during the early stages of COVID-19. For example, a study found that internet searches for terms related to COVID-19 were correlated with actual COVID-19 cases. Here, AI could have been used to predict where an outbreak would happen, and then help officials know how to best communicate and make decisions to help stop the spread.\nHow can AI solutions assist in providing superior patient care?\nYou might think that healthcare from a computer isn’t equal to what a human can provide. That’s true in many situations, but it isn’t always the case.\nStudies have shown that in some situations, AI can do a more accurate job than humans. For example, AI has done a more accurate job than current pathology methods in predicting who will survive malignant mesothelioma, which is a type of cancer that impacts the internal organs. AI is used to identify colon polyps and has been shown to improve colonoscopy accuracy and diagnose colorectal cancer as accurately as skilled endoscopists can.\nIn a study of a social media forum, most people asking healthcare questions preferred responses from an AI-powered chatbot over those from physicians, ranking the chatbot’s answers higher in quality and empathy. However, the researchers conducting this study emphasize that their results only suggest the value of such chatbots in answering patients’ questions, and recommend it be followed up with a more convincing study.\nHow can physicians use AI and machine learning in healthcare?\nOne of the key things that AI may be able to do to help healthcare professionals is save them time. For example:\n- Keeping up with current advances. When physicians are actively participating in caring for people and other clinical duties, it can be challenging for them to keep pace with evolving technological advances that support care. AI can work with huge volumes of information — from medical journals to healthcare records — and highlight the most relevant pieces.\n- Taking care of tedious work. When a healthcare professional must complete tasks like writing clinical notes or filling out forms, AI could potentially complete the task faster than traditional methods, even if revision was needed to refine the first pass AI makes.\nDespite the potential for AI to save time for healthcare professionals, AI isn’t intended to replace humans. The American Medical Association commonly refers to “augmented intelligence,” which stresses the importance of AI assisting, rather than replacing, healthcare professionals. In the case of current AI applications and technology, healthcare professionals are still needed to provide:\n- Clinical context for the algorithms that train AI.\n- Accurate and relevant information for AI to analyze.\n- Translation of AI findings to be meaningful for patients.\nA helpful comparison to reiterate the collaborative nature needed between AI and humans for healthcare is that in most cases, a human pilot is still needed to fly a plane. Although technology has enabled quite a bit of automation in flying today, people are needed to make adjustments, interpret the equipment’s data, and take over in cases of emergency.\nWhat are the drawbacks of AI in healthcare?\nDespite the many exciting possibilities for AI in healthcare, there are some risks to weigh:\n- If not properly trained, AI can lead to bias and discrimination. For example, if AI is trained on electronic health records, it is building only on people that can access healthcare and is perpetuating any human bias captured within the records.\n- AI chatbots can generate medical advice that is misleading or false, which is why there’s a need for effectively regulating their use.\nWhere can AI solutions take the healthcare industry next?\nAs AI continues to evolve and play a more prominent role in healthcare, the need for effective regulation and use becomes more critical. That’s why Mayo Clinic is a member of Health AI Partnership, which is focused on helping healthcare organizations evaluate and implement AI effectively, equitably and safely.\nIn terms of the possibilities for healthcare professionals to further integrate AI, Mark D. Stegall, M.D., a transplant surgeon and researcher at Mayo Clinic in Minnesota says, “I predict AI also will become an important decision-making tool for physicians.”\nMayo Clinic hopes that AI could help create new ways to diagnose, treat, predict, prevent and cure disease. This might be achieved by:\n- Selecting and matching patients with the most promising clinical trials.\n- Developing and setting up remote health-monitoring devices.\n- Detecting currently imperceptible conditions.\n- Anticipating disease-risk years in advance.\nRelevant reading\nMayo Clinic on Hearing and Balance, 3rd Edition\nMayo Clinic on Better Hearing and Balance helps readers understand the possible causes of hearing and balance issues and offers solutions aimed at improving not just hearing and balance, but quality of life overall.", "select_response": "<think>\nThe purpose of the search round was to find specific information on the Stanford-Mayo partnership, AI applications in migraine prediction and neurology, and implementation timelines for AI healthcare technologies. \nThe webpage provided discusses AI's role in healthcare but does not specifically mention the Stanford-Mayo partnership or any migraine prediction capabilities.

The album was self-produced. It is a genre-hopping album that Matthew Bellamy described as \"a greatest hits album – of new songs.\"[2] \"Won't Stand Down\", \"Compliance\", \"Will of the People\", and \"Kill or Be Killed\" were released as singles before the album was released, and \"You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween\" was released as a single the same day the album came out.\nThe album received generally positive reviews and became Muse's seventh consecutive number-one album in the UK.[3] A world tour in support of the album, the Will of the People World Tour, began in April 2022 and concluded in November 2023.[4][5] It was ranked as the #17 best guitar album of 2022 by Guitar World readers.[6]\nBackground and recording\n[edit]About the origins of the album, Matthew Bellamy related that Warner Records requested a greatest hits album from Muse, but, instead, the band decided to make an album that was a \"montage\" of \"all of those types of genres that we’ve touched on in the past\" and would feel like \"a greatest hits album – of new songs.\"[2] Warner stated that the album spans multiple genres, describing \"Will of the People\" as a \"glam rocker\" and \"Kill or Be Killed\" as \"industrial\".[7]\nBellamy said the lyrics on the album were inspired by \"the increasing uncertainty and instability in the world [...] as the Western empire and the natural world, which have cradled us for so long, are genuinely threatened. This album is a personal navigation through those fears and preparation for what comes next.\"[8]\nThe album was recorded at Bellamy's Red Room studio in Santa Monica, California,[9] as well as at Black Lodge and Abbey Road Studios in London.[10]\nPromotion and release\n[edit]The first snippet from the album was heard on 25 December 2021, when Bellamy briefly livestreamed himself and his 10-year-old son, Bing, listening to the song \"Won't Stand Down\".[11][12] About two weeks later, Muse announced the song would be released on 13 January 2022, making it their first single since \"Pressure\" in September 2018.[12] The second single from the album, \"Compliance\", was released on 17 March, alongside the announcement of the album and its release date of 26 August.[13][14]\nThe third single from the album was the title track, which was released on 1 June 2022.[4][15] That same month, Muse began the European festival leg of their Will of the People World Tour, on which they played all three of the new singles live, as well as a then-unreleased track from the album, \"Kill or Be Killed\".[16] On 21 July, \"Kill or Be Killed\" was released as the album's fourth single.[17][18] On 23 August, Muse announced that a fifth single from the album, \"You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween\", would be released on 26 August, the same day as the release of the album.[19][20]\nAn Italian-language version of \"Ghosts (How Can I Move On)\" featuring Elisa was released on 25 November 2022,[21] and a French-language version featuring Mylène Farmer was released two weeks later, on 9 December.[22]\nOn 1 August 2022, it was announced that Will of the People could be purchased as a non-fungible token (NFT) on the \"eco-friendly\" Polygon-powered platform Serenade, and that it would be the first album for which NFT sales would qualify for the UK and Australian charts.[23][24] Per The Guardian: \"The Muse NFT album will retail for £20 and will be limited to 1,000 copies globally. As both an NFT and a limited-edition format, it is relatively sparse in its offering.

Yeung of AllMusic stated that \"While Will of the People is not as essential as their 2000s classics, it's a quick, satisfying burst of Muse essentials that cleverly forgoes the hits-compilation graveyard in favor of fresh material that honors both their evolution and dedicated fan base.\"[32] Emily Swingle of Clash described the album as \"a sharp, punchy dose of Muse...[despite] lyrics [that] can feel uninspired.\"[27] Writing for Classic Rock, Mark Beaumont wrote, \"Muse master the wider range of future rock and pop sonics they’ve been toying with for the past decade and refine and define their current sound as neatly as Black Holes & Revelations did for their 2000s period.\"[33] Emma Wilkes of DIY called the album \"A smorgasbord of dystopian-flavoured cringe.\"[34] Andrew Belt of Gigwise writes, \"Will of the People is heavy on doom-laden lyrics...Yet it also finds Muse at the top of their game — and having a ball — across ten distinctive songs.\"[35]\nCommercial performance\n[edit]In the UK, the album sold 51,500 units in its first week of release, which was enough to make it Muse's seventh consecutive album to top the UK Albums Chart.[41] In the US, with 24,000 album equivalent units, it debuted at number 15 on the Billboard 200, and number 1 on Billboard's Top Alternative Albums and Top Rock Albums charts.[42] As of January 2023, Will of the People has sold over 300,000 units worldwide.[43]\nTrack listing\n[edit]All tracks are written by Matthew Bellamy.\n| No. | Title | Length |\n|---|---|---|\n| 1. | \"Will of the People\" | 3:18 |\n| 2. | \"Compliance\" | 4:10 |\n| 3. | \"Liberation\" | 3:06 |\n| 4. | \"Won't Stand Down\" | 3:29 |\n| 5. | \"Ghosts (How Can I Move On)\" | 3:36 |\n| 6. | \"You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween\" | 3:00 |\n| 7. | \"Kill or Be Killed\" | 5:00 |\n| 8. | \"Verona\" | 4:56 |\n| 9. | \"Euphoria\" | 3:23 |\n| 10. | \"We Are Fucking Fucked\" | 3:36 |\n| Total length: | 37:40 |\nPersonnel\n[edit]|\nMuse\nAdditional musicians\n|\nTechnical personnel\n|\nArtwork\n|\nCharts\n[edit]\nWeekly charts[edit]\n|\nYear-end charts[edit]\n|\nCertifications\n[edit]| Region | Certification | Certified units/sales |\n|---|---|---|\n| France (SNEP)[86] | Platinum | 100,000‡ |\n| United Kingdom (BPI)[87] | Gold | 100,000‡ |\n|\n‡ Sales+streaming figures based on certification alone. |\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ \"Instagram\".\n- ^ a b Moore, Sam (16 May 2022). \"Matt Bellamy says Muse's 'Will Of The People' is \"a greatest hits album – of new songs\"\".

Nella sua disamina, il critico si è soffermato sulla tendenza del gruppo verso il ricalcare i propri stilemi classici, a discapito della sperimentazione che aveva caratterizzato le pubblicazioni precedenti.[24]\nTracce\n[modifica | modifica wikitesto]Testi e musiche di Matthew Bellamy.\n- Will of the People – 3:18\n- Compliance – 4:10\n- Liberation – 3:06\n- Won't Stand Down – 3:29\n- Ghosts (How Can I Move On) – 3:37\n- You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween – 3:00\n- Kill or Be Killed – 4:59\n- Verona – 4:57\n- Euphoria – 3:23\n- We Are Fucking Fucked – 3:36\nFormazione\n[modifica | modifica wikitesto]Hanno partecipato alle registrazioni, secondo le note di copertina:[25]\n- Gruppo\n- Matthew Bellamy – voce, chitarra tastiera, pianoforte, cori (traccia 1), GuitarViol (traccia 4)[26]\n- Chris Wolstenholme – basso, cori (traccia 1)\n- Dominic Howard – batteria, cori (traccia 1)\n- Altri musicisti (traccia 1)\n- Elle Bellamy – cori\n- Bing Bellamy – cori\n- Caris Wolstenholme – cori\n- Ernie Wostenholme – cori\n- Buster Wolstenholme – cori\n- Teddi Wolstenholme – cori\n- Tabitha Wolstenholme Tolhurst – cori\n- Indiana Wolstenholme Tolhurst – cori\n- Produzione\n- Muse – produzione, ingegneria del suono, direzione artistica\n- Aleks von Korff – produzione aggiuntiva, ingegneria del suono, missaggio al Red Room (traccia 7)\n- Şerban Ghenea – missaggio ai MixStar Studios (eccetto tracce 4 e 7)\n- Bryce Bordone – assistenza al missaggio ai MixStar Studios (eccetto tracce 4 e 7)\n- Chris Gehringer – mastering al Sterling Sound\n- Joe Devenney – assistenza tecnica al Red Room, missaggio al Red Room (traccia 7)\n- Andy Maxwell – assistenza tecnica agli Abbey Road Studios\n- Chris Whitemyer – assistenza tecnica\n- Paul Warren – assistenza tecnica\n- Dan Lancaster – missaggio al The Steam Room Studio (traccia 4)\n- Rhys May – assistenza al missaggio al The Steam Room Studio (traccia 4)\n- Adrian Bushby – ingegneria del suono aggiuntiva (traccia 7)\n- Jesse Less Stout – direzione creativa, direzione artistica, copertina, grafica gatefold\n- Tiago Marinho – copertina, grafica gatefold\n- Tyrone Yarde – copertina, grafica gatefold\n- Gabriella Russo – copertina, grafica gatefold\n- Nick Fancher – fotografia\n- Andrea \"Waarp\" Marcias – grafica retro e CD\nClassifiche\n[modifica | modifica wikitesto]Classifiche settimanali\n[modifica | modifica wikitesto]| Classifica (2022) | Posizione massima |\n|---|---|\n| Australia[27] | 1 |\n| Austria[27] | 1 |\n| Belgio (Fiandre)[27] | 2 |\n| Belgio (Vallonia)[27] | 1 |\n| Canada[28] | 5 |\n| Croazia[29] | 1 |\n| Danimarca[27] | 18 |\n| Finlandia[27] | 2 |\n| Francia[27] | 1 |\n| Germania[27] | 2 |\n| Giappone[30] | 20 |\n| Grecia[31] | 36 |\n| Irlanda[32] | 2 |\n| Islanda[33] | 13 |\n| Italia[27] | 1 |\n| Norvegia[27] | 16 |\n| Nuova Zelanda[27] | 1 |\n| Paesi Bassi[27] | 2 |\n| Polonia[34] | 6 |\n| Portogallo[27] | 1 |\n| Regno Unito[35] | 1 |\n| Repubblica Ceca[36] | 37 |\n| Slovacchia[37] | 51 |\n| Spagna[27] | 2 |\n| Stati Uniti[28] | 15 |\n| Svezia[27] | 27 |\n| Svizzera[27] | 1 |\n| Ungheria[38] | 3 |\nNote\n[modifica | modifica wikitesto]- ^ (EN) Neil Z.

Since a lot has happened during these years, it, thematically, explores everything from Black Lives Matter protests, to the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdowns, to the 2021 Capitol riots, and much more.\nAccording to Muse, \"Will of the People was created in Los Angeles and London and is influenced by increasing uncertainty and instability in the world. A pandemic, new wars in Europe, massive protests & riots, an attempted insurrection, Western democracy wavering, rising authoritarianism, wildfires and natural disasters and the destabilisation of the global order all informed Will of the People. It has been a worrying and scary time for all of us as the Western empire and the natural world, which we have cradled us for so long are genuinely threatened. This album is a personal navigation through those fears and preparation for what comes next.\"[5]\nIn an interview with Zane Lowe, upon announcing the album, on March 17th, 2022, Bellamy said about it, that the label originally planned them to release a best-of compilation of existing songs (later elaborating on that, saying that a \"Best-Of Album\" possibility is in their contract[6]). They instead decided to make a new album, which, musically, encapsulates and recaps the Muse's best work from past albums. As Bellamy said in an interview with a French radio station \"RTL 2\" in June of 2022, with the release of Origin of Muse and Origin of Symmetry's 20th Anniversary Remix, the band listened to a lot of their old music during the writing and recording process, and were thinking about certain things and ideas that they tried to do in the past, but they didn't work out. As an example, he mentioned Kill or Be Killed; Saying that \"2 to 3 times in our career, we've tried to create something that kind of...resembled metal or something, but we couldn't quite go there\".[7] As such, as mentioned by Bellamy on the Zane Lowe interview, the album goes \"all the way, from metal, to pop, to my first version of an Adele piano-like song, to electronica\", featuring songs like Kill or Be Killed, which is \"the best prog metal song they've ever done that could've been on Drones\", becoming a fan-favourite after just a few live performances, and We Are Fucking Fucked, which he sees as \"the weirdest, darkest lost B-side of Muse's life\", while also including songs like Liberation, which is, according to NME, a Queen-like ballad song and Verona, bringing \"purity to the nostalgic electronic textures\", as described by Warner themselves .[8]\nIn the same interview, he mentioned that he let Dom Howard take the lead in terms of decisions on this album, jokingly saying that this is why the album, from start to finish, took so long, saying that Howard took time with the process. On top of that, he added that the album was self-produced by the band themselves,[9] however it was made with help and assistance from Aleks Von Korff.\nTaking in account previous mention of Bellamy's idea of 'era blending' and 'best-of' album, Will of The People presents songs that are reminiscent of their previous albums, Will Of The People harks back to songs like Psycho and Uprising; Compliance seemingly a new feature, presents influences from the 90s with a texture from Simulation Theory; Liberation is a song that could have been released on The Resistance; Won't Stand Down, presents patterns and verses that could have been present on Origin of Symmetry with its metal influence with the strings; Ghosts (How Can I Move On), a song that could be the one that Matt described as an 'Adele type of song'; You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween, a song that could be released Simulation Theory with its 80's inspired sound ala Rockwell's Somebody's Watching Me; Kill or Be Killed, is intriguing due the mix of influences, ranging from Absolution, and Black Holes and Revelations to Drones with its metal riffs; Verona presents sounds similar the ones from The 2nd Law, like Follow Me and Madness, with its synths and U2 esque patterns and riffs; Euphoria, similar to the songs from Simulation Theory, presents synths straight out of the 70s and 80s, similar to the works of Donna Summer and Giorgio Moroder; Finally, the closer, 'We Are Fucking Fucked', presents sounds harking back to Showbiz, Origin of Symmetry and The 2nd Law with a riff similar to Knights of Cydonia.\nBackground\nAfter the Simulation Theory World Tour ended in 2019, Bellamy came up with the idea for the album, which, according to his interview with NME, was that they'd \"make it a bit more about what’s actually happening in the world right now\", adding \"what I didn’t know was what was about to happen.\" [10] Later, in January of 2020, Matt first publicly hinted at working on new Muse material in an interview with ALT 98.7 FM, backstage at the ALTerEGO Festival. He said that the goal for 2020 was to work on new Muse material. The plans were brought to halt due to the coronavirus pandemic, as the three were unable to get together due to the lockdowns. Bellamy instead focused on releasing his solo material. Later that year, in May, Matt further hinted on working on Muse material in an interview with Zane Lowe on Beats 1 Radio, saying that he has a few pieces written that are suited for Muse.[11] In an interview with Rolling Stone, also in May, he said that that the idea would be to record the album in 2021 and go on a tour in 2022.[12]\nLater, in 2021, Bellamy further confirmed that work on the new Muse album has begun, in an interview with The Jaded Hearts Club Band for The Sun.[13] Bellamy said the following: \"I started writing when all the protests and all the chaos were kicking off. It’s a weird thing to say but it suits the music I write. It keeps you a little bit on edge.\" Additionally, Bellamy jokingly said, in an Instagram comment reply on Dom Howard's Instagram post, that the album would include \"emotional gasps and many usages of the word ‘soul’.\".\nBellamy also had once got imbued with the recent label's request to release the greatest hits album of Muse's iconic songs from each eighth album they recorded, but they turned down the request and instead, they decide to produce a new album that combined with all various sounds and influences from each of their previous album into a new and fresh package with an additional comment by him as \"a greatest hits album - of a new songs - essentially\" [14] during Matt's interview with NME and the band interview with French radio talk show.\nThe album, and its release date (August 26th, 2022) was finally announced on March 17th, 2022, together with the release of Compliance. The announcement, being six months apart from the release date, was met with mixed feelings from fans, however, since then, one more song has been released, another one performed live, and the fourth song still planned to be released before the album drops. Ordering the album from the official muse.mu website gives the buyer an exclusive chance to access the ticket pre-sale code for future gigs.\nRecording\nIn a 2019 interview with NME, Bellamy said that he'd like the idea of the band \"totally resetting\" and going back to their hometown of Teignmouth, Devon to rehearse and record the album. This was, however, not the case, as the first studio pictures that started to emerge were from Bellamy's own studio, named the Red Room, located in downtown Santa Monica, California, where, in March of 2021, the first proof of Muse being in the studio came from[15] The album was both written and part-recorded in the studio. With Chris in the UK and the rest of the band in the USA, and with all the lockdowns, this was mostly done remotely. Producer Aleks Von Korff, who previously worked with Muse as an engineer on Simulation Theory, and produced Bellamy's solo material - songs like Tomorrow's World - also posted a picture from Red Room during that time, with the wooden Kawai piano.\nBetween April and June 2021, the band took a break from recording, to work on a remix of Origin of Symmetry. In early June, Matt and Dom joined Chris in the UK, continuing work on the album.[16] With the entire band back together in person, recording continued at Abbey Road Studios in London, in the summer of 2021. The band were also joined by Muse's long-time engineer, Adrian Bushby, who posted a picture of him and Howard at Abbey Road Studios tracking drums.[17] This makes the upcoming album the second LP to be partially recorded at Abbey Road, after 20 years, when Origin of Symmetry was recorded at the facility. The album appears to have also been partially recorded at RAK Studios at the end of 2021, with Tre Cool from Green Day mentioned meeting up with Muse during their stay at the studio whilst recording their album, Saviors.[18]\nOn December 1st, 2021, Chris Gehringer, mastering engineer at Sterling Sound Studios posted a picture of Bellamy and Howard sitting on a couch, with the entire album at the mastering stage during that time. [19]\nRelease\nOn December 25th, 2021, Bellamy made up for the lack of a muse.mu Christmas present with a short livestream from his Tesla, on Muse's Instagram profile, showcasing part of Won't Stand Down. The 60 second stream was then screen-recorded by a few people, with copyright bots deleting the posts, hinting at the song being near its release. Matt's minute-long stream can be listened to here. The then-approaching release of the song was teased once again on Muse's New Years Eve Instagram post, when they wrote a caption saying \"Looking forward to WSD. We'll see you on the other side!\", before quickly replacing \"WSD\" with \"2022\". Won't Stand Down was subsequently announced a week later, on January 7th, 2022, on Muse's social media[21], with wontstanddown.muse.mu spotted being online a day earlier. Together with it also came the single artwork and a new promo image of the band. The song was released on January 13th, 2022, on digital platforms.\nAlmost two months later, on March 2nd, 2022, Bellamy posted an Instagram story in which he went over the guitar tuning for Won't Stand Down, while mentioning that a second heavy song will appear on the album.[22]\nOn March 9th, 2022, Muse posted a short, half-minute album teaser video on their YouTube, simply titled \"MUSE\", which depicts statues of the band's heads being torn down by a group of rioters in the middle of a desert, while wearing mirror masks from the Won't Stand Down music video, with a choir of Matts chanting the line \"The Will of the People\", name of the album and title track, with album artwork displayed at the very end of the video.[23]\nTwo days later, on March 11th, 2022, it was discovered by Muse fans that the index code from wontstanddown.muse.mu, contains basic album info, including the tracklist and anagrams for each song which will appear on the album. The same day, Muse announced a new song/single, Compliance. The song, and its music video, leaked on March 15th through Vimeo, before being deleted from the platform on the same day. A day later, anagrams from the wontstanddown index code were also resolved, leaking song titles and the tracklist. Compliance's music video was announced together with the album name on March 16th[24].\nThe album's release date has finally been announced, together with the release of Compliance, on March 17th, 2022. It is available for pre-ordering via willofthepeople.muse.mu and is set to be released on August 26th, 2022.\nMatt reportedly said, to one of the fans after one of the London Apollo charity gigs, in May of 2022, that they intend to release two more songs before the album drops. A day after the second gig, on May 11th, Apple Music began to show the track duration for the title song, while a few days later, on May 13th, a release date for the song was set up for it on Amazon.[25] This led fans to speculate, that Will of the People would be the next single from the album. The song was later leaked on May 26th, 2022, while the official release date of June 1st was announced a day later, on May 27th.\nAfter being played on every gig of the Will of the People Summer Festivals Tour in June & July of 2022, it was announced by Muse on July 13th, 2022, that Kill or Be Killed would be the next song to be released from the album. It was released on July 21st, 2022, at 3PM BST.[26] This is also the last single before the album drop.\nDue to the fact that some people were able to get hold of the album earlier, on August 22nd, short snippets (phone recordings) of the unreleased songs from the album were leaked on Twitter, exception being We Are Fucking Fucked.[27] A day later, on August 23rd, the fifth single was announced by Muse, being You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween. The single, and it's music video, are due to be released on August 26th, together with the album.\nOn August 1st, 2022, it was announced, that Will of the People would also be releasing as an NFT, available on the platform called \"Serenade\".[28] Limited to 1000 copies, it is the first new music format to be charted in the UK since 2015, when music streaming data started counting in the charts, alongside CD, LP and download sales. The NFT cover art is slightly different to the standard one, featuring a purple/blue colour scheme, instead of the orange/blue one, and also featuring Muse's signatures on the digital cover itself.\nOn November 24th, 2022, it was announced by Muse that a new single, Ghosts (How Can I Move On), featuring Italian singer, Elisa Toffoli would be released the next day.\nOn December 9th, 2022, Ghosts (How Can I Move On) was announced to have a second single, featuring French singer, Mylène Farmer and was released simultaneously.\nCritical Reception\nAfter the release, Metacritic scored the album in 71 out of 100, indicating the generally positive and favourable reviews. It was also commercially successful to become the Muse's seventh UK No.1 album. NME described the ninth album as their \"best music in these years\" and more respectable than their previous awkward trend-chasing album \"Simulation Theory\"[29]. Won't Stand Down and Kill or Be Killed have been appointed as the greatest sounds of all Muse's track by some mainstream critics, praising the styles and bringing the best composition into this album, implying those two tracks is going to be the new Stockholm Syndrome\nCritic also spotted the last track, We Are Fucking Fucked, as a perfect closer to highlighting the straightforward lyrics that deliver the powerful chorus, which is giving a throwback to Showbiz and Black Holes and Revelations era.\nThe album was well-received amongst critics, with Kerrang rating it 4/5[30], and Riff Magazine rating it 9/10[31]. Mark Beaumont of Classic Rock Magazine also rated the album 9/10,[32] while Record Collector rated Will of the People with four stars and Gigwise gave the album a score of 8/10.[33]\nArtwork & Design\nWith Jesse Lee Stout back as their creative director, all the design and creative elements from the live shows, the music videos, and the rest of the art, are again intertwined with each other, like during Simulaiton Theory. The first design element of the album was the monogram (shown in the picture), consisting of letters \"W\", \"O\", \"T\" and \"P\". It first appeared on the single artwork for Won't Stand Down.and was already speculated at that time, that the monogram might be linked to the album name. The monogram makes appearances throughout the entirety of the album era.\nThe artwork, made by Portuguese digital artist Tiago Marinho, is set somewhere in a post-apocalyptic city, located in the middle of some desert (the design is very similar to the post-apocalyptic London, shown on the Sing for Absolution single artwork), and shows large demolished statues of the band's heads, with a group of rioters, later revealed to be the \"masked hackers\", standing next to them. The character of this \"masked hacker\", also dubbed as \"Will\" (hailing from the album's name), wears a reflective mask, which, like the monogram, also appears throughout the entire album cycle.\nOn the cover, each of the three demolished heads has graffiti sprayed all over them. These include the WOTP monograms scattered on each of the heads, aswel as names of songs. Other words written as graffiti include \"Die\" and \"Fuck off\" on Matt's head, both lines from the songs. Dom's head also includes \"IX\" written on it in Roman numerals, standing for the album being their ninth one. This is the first artwork since Black Holes and Revelations to not feature the Muse logo, or the album name on the art itself. It is also the second album artwork in a row / second main album artwork alltogether, to feature the bands' faces.\nThe story behind the album artwork is represented in the music video for the single, Will of the People.\nTouring\nOn March 20th, 2022, several fans have spotted graffiti and stickers with the, then unknown monogram, in and around the Shepherd's Bush Empire area in the Shepherd's Bush district of London, UK. It was unknown what exactly this meant at the time. Some have suggested that it was just a marketing campaign, while others have suggested a surprise show was going to take place soon.[34][35][36] Two fundraising concerts, in support of the album, were announced a week after the graffiti started to appear, on March 28th, which took place on May 9th and May 10th, at London's Eventim Apollo. Muse supported War Child & Médecins Sans Frontières on night one, and The Big Issue on night two.[37] Prior to the two shows, a very small gig, kept in complete secrecy, was performed on April 7th, 2022, at Exeter's Cavern Club. The gig was recorded for \"Jim Beam's Welcome Sessions\".\nThe Will of the People Festivals Tour was the first largest tour of the album era. It took place between summer and winter of 2022. The band headlined festivals across Europe, with an additional few gigs on U.S. festivals. The show itself, at times, loosely resembled that of Simulation Theory World Tour's, having a large Murph-inspired inflatable figure on stage, overlooking the band and the crowd, and \"The Power Glove\" returning. During the festivals tour, a smaller tour, called the Will Of The People Theatre Tour, was announced in June of 2022. On it, Muse were performing in smaller venues across Europe and the USA. Some of them haven't seen Muse perform live in almost 20 years. The tour took place during the main legs of the festivals tour, in October 2022.\nA bigger headlining tour is currently taking place, including both indoor, outdoor and festival shows. The tour began in Mexico in January of 2023, headed to North America in the spring and Europe in the summer, before finishing off in Kuala Lumpur in August of 2023.\nTracklist\nCD/Digital\n- Will of the People – 3:18\n- Compliance – 4:10\n- Liberation – 3:06\n- Won't Stand Down – 3:29\n- Ghosts (How Can I Move On) – 3:37\n- You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween – 3:00\n- Kill or Be Killed – 4:59\n- Verona – 4:57\n- Euphoria – 3:23\n- We Are Fucking Fucked – 3:36\nVinyl\nSide A (One)\n- Will of the People – 3:18\n- Compliance – 4:10\n- Liberation – 3:06\n- Won't Stand Down – 3:29\n- Ghosts (How Can I Move On) – 3:37\nSide B (Two)\n- You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween – 3:00\n- Kill or Be Killed – 4:59\n- Verona – 4:57\n- Euphoria – 3:23\n- We Are Fucking Fucked – 3:36\nCassette\nSide A\n- Will of the People – 3:18\n- Compliance – 4:10\n- Liberation – 3:06\n- Won't Stand Down – 3:29\n- Ghosts (How Can I Move On) – 3:37\nSide B\n- You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween – 3:00\n- Kill or Be Killed – 4:59\n- Verona – 4:57\n- Euphoria – 3:23\n- We Are Fucking Fucked – 3:36\nWill of the People gallery\nPersonnel\nMuse\n- Matt Bellamy - Vocals, backing vocals, crowd vocals (tracks 1, 10), guitar, guitarviol (tracks 3 & 4), keyboards, piano, synth programming, production, art direction\n- Chris Wolstenholme - Bass, backing vocals, crowd vocals (track 1), production, art direction\n- Dominic Howard - Drums, percussion, drum programming, crowd vocals (track 1), production, art direction\nAdditional performers\n- Elle Bellamy - Crowd vocals (track 1)\n- Bing Bellamy - Crowd vocals (track 1)\n- Caris Wolstenholme - Crowd vocals (track 1)\n- Ernie Wolstenholme - Crowd vocals (track 1)\n- Buster Wolstenholme - Crowd vocals (track 1)\n- Teddi Wolstenholme - Crowd vocals (track 1)\n- Tabitha Wolstenholme Tolhurst - Crowd vocals (track 1)\n- Indiana Wolstenholme Tolhurst - Crowd vocals (track 1)\nProduction\n- Aleks Von Korff - Additional production, engineering, mixing (track 7)\n- Adrian Bushby - Additional engineering (track 7)\n- Joe Devenney - Engineering assistant\n- Serban Ghenea - Mixing (tracks 1-3, 5-6, 8-10)\n- Bryce Bordone - Mixing engineer (tracs 1-3, 5-6, 8-10)\n- Dan Lancaster - Mixing (track 4)\n- Rhys May - Mixing assistant (track 4)\n- Chris Whitemyer - Technical assistant\n- Paul Warren - Technical assistant\n- Andy Maxwell - Abbey Road assistance\n- Tommy Bosustow - Abbey Road assistance\n- Chris Gehringer - Mastering\nArt\n- Jesse Lee Stout - Creative direction, artwork (gatefold)\n- Tiago Marinho - Artwork (front cover, gatefold, NFT cover)\n- Andrea “Waarp” Marcias - Artwork (back cover, poster art, LP side A)\n- Miko del Rosario - Artwork (LP side B)\n- Gabriella Russo - Artwork (gatefold)\n- Tyrone Yarde - Artwork (gatefold)\n- Nick Fancher - Photography\nNinth album recording gallery\n\"Might as well!

Il est le successeur de Simulation Theory, paru en 2018. L'album a été écrit à Los Angeles et enregistré en 2021 au studio Abbey Road à Londres, tout juste 20 ans après Origin of Symmetry, dernier album du groupe ayant été enregistré dans ce studio[2].\nLe premier single issu de l'album, Won't Stand Down, est publié le [3]. Trois autres singles sortent par la suite : Compliance, Will of the People, Kill or Be Killed puis un cinquième le jour de la sortie de l’album : You Make Me Feel Like It’s Halloween. Ghosts (How Can I Move On) sortira en Novembre 2022 en single hors album avec deux collaborations.\nAvec 10 morceaux et 37 minutes 35 secondes, il s'agit de l’album le plus court de la discographie du groupe et le premier album de l’industrie musicale à sortir au format NFT.\nDéveloppement\n[modifier | modifier le code]Après s'être essayé dans deux projets musicaux en 2020, un album avec le supergroupe The Jaded Hearts Club et des compositions en solo, Matthew Bellamy annonce dans le numéro d'août 2020 de Total Guitar et sur la page Facebook officielle du groupe le 3 août 2020 un retour en studio du groupe, probablement dès 2021, pour l’enregistrement de l'album, successeur de Simulation Theory paru en 2018. Cette fois-ci, l'album ne sera pas dirigé par Matt, mais pas Dominic Howard[4].\nÀ l’origine, Warner Bros., le label du groupe, souhaitait un best of des plus gros succès du groupe. Ce dernier refuse et Matthew Bellamy propose à la place des compositions originales qui seraient chacune la « meilleure version de chaque style ». Il déclare au média MetalZone : « Nous étions arrivés à un point où il était question de faire un album de nos plus grands succès, et nous n’étions pas vraiment en faveur de cela. Donc on a presque fait un disque qui est une compilation de nos plus grands succès – mais avec de nouvelles chansons. Cela signifie que cet album contient un morceau de Metal – et c’est comme, le meilleur morceau de Metal que nous ayons jamais fait. Et il y a une sorte de ballade douce, une chanson d’amour, et c’est probablement la meilleure ballade d’amour qu’on ait jamais faite, et ainsi de suite. »[5].\nLe , Matthew Bellamy fait un direct Instagram avec le compte du groupe à bord de sa voiture dans les rues de Los Angeles, accompagné de son fils, où il dévoile un extrait d'un morceau inédit intitulé Won't Stand Down en fond sonore. Le morceau se présente comme le plus heavy metal de la discographie du groupe[6]. Le , le titre, la pochette et la date de sortie du single sont officiellement annoncés par le groupe sur les réseaux sociaux[7].\nLe , une courte vidéo postée par le groupe sur YouTube donne des indications sur la pochette de l'album et sur les titres qui composeront celui-ci. Deux jours plus tard, le deuxième single de l'album Compliance est annoncé sur les réseaux sociaux pour une sortie le jeudi [8]. Le single Compliance est alors publié sur les plateformes de streaming. Lors de cette sortie, le groupe dévoilet officiellement la date de sortie de l'album fixé au ainsi que la pochette, les pistes de l'album et les formats de sortie.\nLe troisième single éponyme de l’album, Will of the People, sort le 1er juin 2022. Quelques jours plus tard, le groupe dévoile Kill or Be Killed, un quatrième extrait inédit de l’album lors du festival Rock am Ring en Allemagne[9], festival d’ouverture de la tournée d’été. Le titre sort officiellement le . Le , jour de la sortie de l'album, paraît You Make Me Feel Like It’s Halloween, cinquième extrait de l'album ainsi que le clip vidéo, à l'effigie des films d'horreur mythiques des années 1970-2000 comme Halloween, Scream, Vendredi 13, L'Exorciste, Misery, Shining, etc.\nLe 25 novembre 2022, sort le sixième single, Ghosts (How Can I Move On). Il est accompagné d’une face-B, une version de la chanson en duo avec la chanteuse italienne Elisa Toffoli[10],[11]. Deux semaines plus tard, une version en français sort en duo avec la chanteuse Mylène Farmer[12],[13],[14].\nL'album\n[modifier | modifier le code]Artworks (album et singles)\n[modifier | modifier le code]La pochette de l'album est dévoilée le à l’occasion de la sortie du deuxième extrait Compliance. Elle représente les têtes géantes sculptées en pierre des trois membres du groupe à moitié ensevelies et endommagées. Les visages sont tagués du monogramme « WOTP ». L’atmosphère lumineuse orangée et apocalyptique évoque un côté dramatique comme lors des incendies géants. Il s'agit du premier album depuis Black Holes and Revelations (2006) à ne pas faire apparaitre le logo du groupe sur la pochette et du deuxième album après Simulation Theory (2018) à faire apparaitre le visage des membres du groupe.\nL'artwork de Won't Stand Down représente le personnage de Kueen, vêtu d'une toge noire à capuche et un masque métallique couvrant tout son visage survolant dix disciples casqués. Le nom du groupe est inscrit au centre, sous lequel se trouve le nom du morceau ainsi qu'un monogramme formé par la superposition des lettres W, O, T et P (initiales du titre de l'album Will of the People). Ce logo se retrouve également sur les costumes des disciples dans le clip de Won't Stand Down.\nDans une courte vidéo publiée sur leur page internet le 8 mars 2022, le titre Will of the People est répété en boucle, qui correspondrait ainsi au monogramme WOTP visible dans le clip de Won't Stand Down.\nLe photographe chargé de la communication du groupe pour cet album est Nick Fancher.\nThèmes\n[modifier | modifier le code]D'après le groupe sur le réseau social Instagram dans un texte en vidéo posté le 16 mars 2022, Will Of The People a été créé à Los Angeles et à Londres. Il est influencé par l'augmentation de l'instabilité dans le monde, la pandémie du COVID-19, la guerre en Ukraine, manifestations et émeutes massives à travers le globe, une tentative d'insurrection, des démocraties occidentales vacillantes, la montée de l'autoritarisme, les catastrophes naturelles liées aux changements climatiques comme les incendies de forêt[15],[16].\nD’après Matthew Bellamy dans le magazine Metalzone à propos du premier single, « “Won’t Stand Down est une chanson qui parle de se défendre contre les brutes, que ce soit dans la cour de récréation, au travail ou ailleurs. [Cette chanson parle de] se protéger de la coercition et de la manipulation sociopathique et d’affronter l’adversité avec force, confiance et agressivité.” »[17].\nDans une vidéo publiée les , le groupe donne une définition au mot « compliance », à propos du morceau du même nom : « La compliance est une promesse de sécurité et réconfort qui nous est vendue par les puissants en temps de vulnérabilité. Les gangs, les gouvernements, les démagogues, les médias sociaux, les algorithmes et les religions nous séduisent par des tromperies de contrevérités et des fables réconfortantes. Ils veulent nous faire adhérer à leur vision étroite du monde, nous faire obéir et fermer les yeux sur nos propres voix intérieure de la raison et de la compassion. Ils ont juste besoin de notre compliance. »[8]. Cette définition donnée par le groupe établie que les entités dites « supérieures » manipulent les foules en modifiant la vision des sociétés, les idées en la modelant à leur propre valeurs, une vision étriquée et non tolérante[18].\nSonorités\n[modifier | modifier le code]L'album est principalement composé de sonorités rock et acoustiques. Il s'agit de l'album le moins électronique des dernières décennies de la discographie du groupe. Un seul morceau, Verona, est principalement électronique. Le reste de l'album alterne des chansons rock, glam rock, nu metal ou encore acoustique au piano. En avril 2021, le batteur Dominic Howard déclare que l'album « sonne lourd »[19]. Won't Stand Down, le premier extrait de l'album a des sonorités rock et Heavy metal[20].\nListe des pistes\n[modifier | modifier le code]| No | Titre | Durée | |||||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1. | Will of the People | 3:18 | |||||||\n| 2. | Compliance | 4:10 | |||||||\n| 3. | Liberation | 3:06 | |||||||\n| 4. | Won't Stand Down | 3:29 | |||||||\n| 5. | Ghosts (How Can I Move On) | 3:37 | |||||||\n| 6. | You Make Me Feel Like It’s Halloween | 3:00 | |||||||\n| 7. | Kill or Be Killed | 4:59 | |||||||\n| 8. | Verona | 4:57 | |||||||\n| 9. | Euphoria | 3:23 | |||||||\n| 10. | We Are Fucking Fucked | 3:26 | |||||||\n| 37:35 |\nFormats de l'album\n[modifier | modifier le code]La liste des titres est dévoilée le 17 mars 2022 lors de l'annonce officielle de l'album et de la sortie du single \"Compliance\" le même jour.

Elle a été réalisée par le réalisateur anglais Jeremi Durand.

Elle a été réalisée par le réalisateur américain Tom Teller[25]. Elle met en scène un groupe de cambrioleur pénétrant dans un manoir hanté pour le saccager. Ils sont alors attaqués par des phénomènes paranormaux au sein du manoir. Ses phénomènes font référence à de nombreux films d’horreur de la culture pop[26] des années 70 et 80[27] comme Poltergeist, Vendredi 13, L’Exorciste, Scream, Saw[28] et la saga Halloween (les masques portés par les personnages)[25], mais également Ça avec les ballons rouges et l’imperméable jaune porté par le clown, accrochés au mur, dans le couloir de l’hôtel Overlook dans le film Shining[27].\nTournée\n[modifier | modifier le code]La tournée promotionnelle de l'album, le \"Will of the People World Tour\" débute en avril 2022 à Londres et se termine par la tournée des stades en Europe de Mai à Juillet 2023 et une date en Malaisie à Kuala Lumpur fin Juillet 2023.\nLes premières dates concernant la tournée promotionnelle de l'album sont annoncées en 2021.

It is a genre-hopping album that Matthew Bellamy described as \"a greatest hits album – of new songs.\"[2] \"Won't Stand Down\", \"Compliance\", \"Will of the People\", and \"Kill or Be Killed\" were released as singles before the album was released, and \"You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween\" was released as a single the same day the album came out.\nThe album received generally positive reviews and became Muse's seventh consecutive number-one album in the UK.[3] A world tour in support of the album, the Will of the People World Tour, began in April 2022 and concluded in November 2023.[4][5] It was ranked as the #17 best guitar album of 2022 by Guitar World readers.[6]\nRemove ads\nBackground and recording\nAbout the origins of the album, Matthew Bellamy related that Warner Records requested a greatest hits album from Muse, but, instead, the band decided to make an album that was a \"montage\" of \"all of those types of genres that we’ve touched on in the past\" and would feel like \"a greatest hits album – of new songs.\"[2] Warner stated that the album spans multiple genres, describing \"Will of the People\" as a \"glam rocker\" and \"Kill or Be Killed\" as \"industrial\".[7]\nBellamy said the lyrics on the album were inspired by \"the increasing uncertainty and instability in the world [...] as the Western empire and the natural world, which have cradled us for so long, are genuinely threatened. This album is a personal navigation through those fears and preparation for what comes next.\"[8]\nThe album was recorded at Bellamy's Red Room studio in Santa Monica, California,[9] as well as at Black Lodge and Abbey Road Studios in London.[10]\nRemove ads\nPromotion and release\nSummarize\nPerspective\nThe first snippet from the album was heard on 25 December 2021, when Bellamy briefly livestreamed himself and his 10-year-old son, Bing, listening to the song \"Won't Stand Down\".[11][12] About two weeks later, Muse announced the song would be released on 13 January 2022, making it their first single since \"Pressure\" in September 2018.[12] The second single from the album, \"Compliance\", was released on 17 March, alongside the announcement of the album and its release date of 26 August.[13][14]\nThe third single from the album was the title track, which was released on 1 June 2022.[4][15] That same month, Muse began the European festival leg of their Will of the People World Tour, on which they played all three of the new singles live, as well as a then-unreleased track from the album, \"Kill or Be Killed\".[16] On 21 July, \"Kill or Be Killed\" was released as the album's fourth single.[17][18] On 23 August, Muse announced that a fifth single from the album, \"You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween\", would be released on 26 August, the same day as the release of the album.[19][20]\nAn Italian-language version of \"Ghosts (How Can I Move On)\" featuring Elisa was released on 25 November 2022,[21] and a French-language version featuring Mylène Farmer was released two weeks later, on 9 December.[22]\nOn 1 August 2022, it was announced that Will of the People could be purchased as a non-fungible token (NFT) on the \"eco-friendly\" Polygon-powered platform Serenade, and that it would be the first album for which NFT sales would qualify for the UK and Australian charts.[23][24] Per The Guardian: \"The Muse NFT album will retail for £20 and will be limited to 1,000 copies globally. As both an NFT and a limited-edition format, it is relatively sparse in its offering. Buyers will get a downloadable version of the album – complete with different sleeve – as high-res FLAC files; the members of Muse will digitally sign it and each of the 1,000 buyers will have their names permanently listed on the linked roster of purchasers.\"[24]\nRemove ads\nComposition\nMusically, Will of the People has been described as glam rock,[25][26] alternative rock,[27] synth-pop,[25] arena rock,[25] hard rock,[28] progressive rock,[28] heavy metal,[29] progressive metal,[28] industrial metal,[26] and electropop.[26]\nCritical reception\nSummarize\nPerspective\nWill of the People received generally positive reviews from critics. On Metacritic, it has a normalised score of 71 out of 100 based on 14 mainstream critics, indicating \"generally favourable reviews\".[31] Neil Z. Yeung of AllMusic stated that \"While Will of the People is not as essential as their 2000s classics, it's a quick, satisfying burst of Muse essentials that cleverly forgoes the hits-compilation graveyard in favor of fresh material that honors both their evolution and dedicated fan base.\"[32] Emily Swingle of Clash described the album as \"a sharp, punchy dose of Muse...[despite] lyrics [that] can feel uninspired.\"[27] Writing for Classic Rock, Mark Beaumont wrote, \"Muse master the wider range of future rock and pop sonics they’ve been toying with for the past decade and refine and define their current sound as neatly as Black Holes & Revelations did for their 2000s period.\"[33] Emma Wilkes of DIY called the album \"A smorgasbord of dystopian-flavoured cringe.\"[34] Andrew Belt of Gigwise writes, \"Will of the People is heavy on doom-laden lyrics...Yet it also finds Muse at the top of their game — and having a ball — across ten distinctive songs.\"[35]\nRemove ads\nCommercial performance\nIn the UK, the album sold 51,500 units in its first week of release, which was enough to make it Muse's seventh consecutive album to top the UK Albums Chart.[41] In the US, with 24,000 album equivalent units, it debuted at number 15 on the Billboard 200, and number 1 on Billboard's Top Alternative Albums and Top Rock Albums charts.[42] As of January 2023, Will of the People has sold over 300,000 units worldwide.[43]\nRemove ads\nTrack listing\nAll tracks are written by Matthew Bellamy.\nPersonnel\nSummarize\nPerspective\n|\nMuse\nAdditional musicians\n|\nTechnical personnel\n|\nArtwork\n|\nRemove ads\nCharts\nSummarize\nPerspective\nRemove ads\nCertifications\nReferences\nWikiwand - on\nSeamless Wikipedia browsing.

Het album werd uitgebracht op 26 augustus 2022. De band was zelf verantwoordelijk voor de productie. Er werden vier singles uitgebracht voorafgaand aan het verschijnen van het album; 'Won't Stand Down', 'Compliance', 'Will of the People' en 'Kill or Be Killed'. De vijfde single van het album, 'You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween', werd uitgebracht op dezelfde dag dat het volledige album verscheen. Will of the People werd digitaal uitgebracht op verschillende streamingdiensten en op cd, vinyl en muziekcassette.\nAchtergrond\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]Het album werd opgenomen in Londen en Los Angeles. Volgens frontman Matthew Bellamy is het album beïnvloed door \"the increasing uncertainty and instability in the world.\" In een verklaring noemde hij onder andere de coronapandemie, oorlog in Europa (de Russische invasie van Oekraïne in 2022), grote onrust onder de bevolking en natuurrampen.[1] De band werd aangespoord om een greatest hits-album te maken, maar dat wezen de bandleden af. Will of the People bevat een mengelmoes van de verschillende genres die de band in het verleden heeft gespeeld en is in dat opzicht het antwoord geworden op het verzoek.[2]\nWill of the People World Tour\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]Op 7 april 2022 ving the Will of the People World Tour aan. Op die dag gaf de band het startschot van de tournee in de vorm van een besloten concert in Exeter.[3][4] Tot en met september werden er optredens verzorgd tijdens festivals in Europa. Vanaf oktober tot en met juni 2023 zijn er wereldwijd shows gepland. Muse wierf producer Dan Lancaster voor de liveband. Lancaster had eerder de single 'Won't Stand Down' gemixt.[5]\nOntvangst\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]Het album werd overwegend positief ontvangen. Op Metacritic kreeg Will of the People op basis van 11 recensies een gewogen gemiddelde score van 78/100, wat neerkomt op \"Generally favorable reviews\".[6] In de Benelux werd het album gematigd positief ontvangen. Zowel Alexander van Eenennaam van het Algemeen Dagblad als Gijsbert Kamer van de Volkskrant gaven twee van vijf sterren.[7][8] Floor Deckx van De Standaard gaf drie van vijf sterren.[9]\nNummers\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]| Nr. | Titel | Duur | |||||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1. | Will of the People | 3:18 | |||||||\n| 2. | Compliance | 4:10 | |||||||\n| 3. | Liberation | 3:06 | |||||||\n| 4. | Won't Stand Down | 3:30 | |||||||\n| 5. | Ghosts (How Can I Move On) | 3:36 | |||||||\n| 6. | You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween | 3:00 | |||||||\n| 7. | Kill or Be Killed | 5:00 | |||||||\n| 8. | Verona | 4:56 | |||||||\n| 9. | Euphoria | 3:23 | |||||||\n| 10. | We Are Fucking Fucked | 3:36 | |||||||\n| Totale duur: 37:35 |\nBezetting\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]- Matthew Bellamy – zang, gitaren, keyboard\n- Christopher Wolstenholme – basgitaar, zang\n- Dominic Howard – drums\nHitnoteringen\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]Nederlandse Album Top 100\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]| Hitnotering: (Week 1 t/m 7) 03-09-2022 t/m 15-10-2022 Hitnotering: (Week 8) 29-10-2022 Hitnotering: (Week 9 t/m 10) 10-06-2023 t/m 17-06-2023 | ||||||||||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Week: | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | ||\n| Positie: | 2 | 9 | 11 | 19 | 17 | 42 | 78 | uit | 94 | uit | 63 | 81 |\nVlaamse Ultratop 200 Albums\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]| Hitnotering: (Week 1 t/m 13) 03-09-2022 t/m 26-11-2022 Hitnotering: (Week 14 t/m 16) 10-12-2022 t/m 24-12-2022 Hitnotering: (Week 17) 08-07-2023 | |||||||||||||||||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Week: | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | ||\n| Positie: | 2 | 8 | 20 | 21 | 17 | 37 | 85 | 143 | 100 | 106 | 83 | 143 | 143 | uit | 150 | 125 | 129 | uit | 155 |\nExterne links\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]- (en) Will of the People op Discogs\n- (en) Will of the People op Muse.mu\n- (en) Will of the People op MuseWiki\n- ↑ (en) Moore, Sam, Muse announce new album ‘Will Of The People’ and share new single ‘Compliance’.

The song is intended to be a \"populist parody, almost the antithesis to 'Uprising',\" another Muse song with a similar anti-establishment theme that instead \"[takes] it seriously.\"[8]\nMusic video\neditThe music video for \"Will of the People\" was released on 1 June 2022 at 15:00 BST (UTC+1), the same day as the single was released. The music video for \"Will of the People\" follows on from the videos for previous singles \"Won't Stand Down\" and \"Compliance\", continuing the same themes and following the same characters.[4]\nThe video, directed and animated by Tom Teller,[4] is set in a dystopian city in which a revolution takes place. The video opens with a person receiving a delivery of a metallic mask, the same as the mask featured in the \"Won't Stand Down\" and \"Compliance\" music videos; he is later revealed to be Will the Hacker, the leader of the revolution. As the video progresses, a growing number of revolutionaries advance through the city,[7] destroying security cameras, spraying \"Will of the People\" logo graffiti onto walls, tearing down statues and attacking the building belonging to the Ministry of Truth,[9] in reference to George Orwell's dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four.\nAs the Ministry of Truth building explodes and continues to burn, the city's electricity supply and mobile phone signals are shut down in an attempt to smother the revolution. The leaders of the revolution depart the city in futuristic supercars,[7] resembling Tesla Cybertrucks, heading into the desert as the skyline of the city burns behind them.[7][9] In the desert the revolutionaries find three ancient statues of the faces of band members Matt Bellamy, Dominic Howard and Chris Wolstenholme carved in the style of Mount Rushmore; they are destroyed by being pulled to the ground with cables, before being covered in \"Will of the People\" logo graffiti. Three members take off their masks, revealing themselves as the members of Muse.[7][9]\nThe music video for \"Will of the People\" references multiple forms of popular culture; as well as Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, the video has been compared to \"V for Vendetta set in [the] Blade Runner 2049 universe\".[4]\nPersonnel\neditCredits adapted from Tidal.[10]\nMuse\n- Matt Bellamy – lead vocals, guitars, composition, production, engineering\n- Chris Wolstenholme – bass guitar, production, engineering\n- Dominic Howard – drums, production, engineering\nProduction\n- Aleks Von Korff – additional production, engineering\n- Chris Gehringer – mastering\n- Serban Ghenea – mixing\n- Bryce Bordone – mixing engineer\n- Andy Maxwell – studio assistant\n- Joe Devenney – studio assistant\n- Tommy Bosustow – studio assistant\n- Chris Whitemyer – technical assistant\n- Paul Warren – technical assistant\nCharts\nedit| Chart (2022) | Peak position |\n|---|---|\n| Canada Rock (Billboard)[11] | 44 |\n| Czech Republic Rock (IFPI)[12] | 12 |\n| Japan Hot Overseas (Billboard)[13] | 19 |\n| New Zealand Hot Singles (RMNZ)[14] | 25 |\n| UK Singles Sales (OCC)[15] | 96 |\n| UK Singles Downloads (OCC)[16] | 93 |\n| UK Rock & Metal (OCC)[17] | 11 |\n| US Mainstream Rock (Billboard)[18] | 23 |\nReferences\nedit- ^ \"WOTP August 26th.

This album is a personal navigation through those fears and preparation for what comes next.\"[8]\nThe album was recorded at Bellamy's Red Room studio in Santa Monica, California,[9] as well as at Black Lodge and Abbey Road Studios in London.[10]\nPromotion and release\n[edit]The first snippet from the album was heard on 25 December 2021, when Bellamy briefly livestreamed himself and his 10-year-old son, Bing, listening to the song \"Won't Stand Down\".[11][12] About two weeks later, Muse announced the song would be released on 13 January 2022, making it their first single since \"Pressure\" in September 2018.[12] The second single from the album, \"Compliance\", was released on 17 March, alongside the announcement of the album and its release date of 26 August.[13][14]\nThe third single from the album was the title track, which was released on 1 June 2022.[4][15] That same month, Muse began the European festival leg of their Will of the People World Tour, on which they played all three of the new singles live, as well as a then-unreleased track from the album, \"Kill or Be Killed\".[16] On 21 July, \"Kill or Be Killed\" was released as the album's fourth single.[17][18] On 23 August, Muse announced that a fifth single from the album, \"You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween\", would be released on 26 August, the same day as the release of the album.[19][20]\nAn Italian-language version of \"Ghosts (How Can I Move On)\" featuring Elisa was released on 25 November 2022,[21] and a French-language version featuring Mylène Farmer was released two weeks later, on 9 December.[22]\nOn 1 August 2022, it was announced that Will of the People could be purchased as a non-fungible token (NFT) on the \"eco-friendly\" Polygon-powered platform Serenade, and that it would be the first album for which NFT sales would qualify for the UK and Australian charts.[23][24] Per The Guardian: \"The Muse NFT album will retail for £20 and will be limited to 1,000 copies globally. As both an NFT and a limited-edition format, it is relatively sparse in its offering. Buyers will get a downloadable version of the album – complete with different sleeve – as high-res FLAC files; the members of Muse will digitally sign it and each of the 1,000 buyers will have their names permanently listed on the linked roster of purchasers.\"[24]\nComposition\n[edit]Musically, Will of the People has been described as glam rock,[25][26] alternative rock,[27] synth-pop,[25] arena rock,[25] hard rock,[28] progressive rock,[28] heavy metal,[29] progressive metal,[28] industrial metal,[26] and electropop.[26]\nCritical reception\n[edit]| Aggregate scores | |\n|---|---|\n| Source | Rating |\n| AnyDecentMusic? | 6.5/10[30] |\n| Metacritic | 71/100[31] |\n| Review scores | |\n| Source | Rating |\n| AllMusic | [32] |\n| Clash | 7/10[27] |\n| Classic Rock | [33] |\n| DIY | [34] |\n| Gigwise | [35] |\n| Kerrang! | 4/5[36] |\n| MusicOMH | [37] |\n| NME | [38] |\n| Pitchfork | 3.7/10[39] |\n| Sputnikmusic | 3.5/5[40] |\nWill of the People received generally positive reviews from critics. On Metacritic, it has a normalised score of 71 out of 100 based on 14 mainstream critics, indicating \"generally favourable reviews\".[31] Neil Z. Yeung of AllMusic stated that \"While Will of the People is not as essential as their 2000s classics, it's a quick, satisfying burst of Muse essentials that cleverly forgoes the hits-compilation graveyard in favor of fresh material that honors both their evolution and dedicated fan base.\"[32] Emily Swingle of Clash described the album as \"a sharp, punchy dose of Muse...[despite] lyrics [that] can feel uninspired.\"[27] Writing for Classic Rock, Mark Beaumont wrote, \"Muse master the wider range of future rock and pop sonics they’ve been toying with for the past decade and refine and define their current sound as neatly as Black Holes & Revelations did for their 2000s period.\"[33] Emma Wilkes of DIY called the album \"A smorgasbord of dystopian-flavoured cringe.\"[34] Andrew Belt of Gigwise writes, \"Will of the People is heavy on doom-laden lyrics...Yet it also finds Muse at the top of their game — and having a ball — across ten distinctive songs.\"[35]\nCommercial performance\n[edit]In the UK, the album sold 51,500 units in its first week of release, which was enough to make it Muse's seventh consecutive album to top the UK Albums Chart.[41] In the US, with 24,000 album equivalent units, it debuted at number 15 on the Billboard 200, and number 1 on Billboard's Top Alternative Albums and Top Rock Albums charts.[42] As of January 2023, Will of the People has sold over 300,000 units worldwide.[43]\nTrack listing\n[edit]All tracks are written by Matthew Bellamy.\n| No. | Title | Length |\n|---|---|---|\n| 1. | \"Will of the People\" | 3:18 |\n| 2. | \"Compliance\" | 4:10 |\n| 3. | \"Liberation\" | 3:06 |\n| 4. | \"Won't Stand Down\" | 3:29 |\n| 5. | \"Ghosts (How Can I Move On)\" | 3:36 |\n| 6. | \"You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween\" | 3:00 |\n| 7. | \"Kill or Be Killed\" | 5:00 |\n| 8. | \"Verona\" | 4:56 |\n| 9. | \"Euphoria\" | 3:23 |\n| 10. | \"We Are Fucking Fucked\" | 3:36 |\n| Total length: | 37:40 |\nPersonnel\n[edit]|\nMuse\nAdditional musicians\n|\nTechnical personnel\n|\nArtwork\n|\nCharts\n[edit]\nWeekly charts[edit]\n|\nYear-end charts[edit]\n|\nCertifications\n[edit]| Region | Certification | Certified units/sales |\n|---|---|---|\n| France (SNEP)[86] | Platinum | 100,000‡ |\n| United Kingdom (BPI)[87] | Gold | 100,000‡ |\n|\n‡ Sales+streaming figures based on certification alone. |\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ \"Instagram\".\n- ^ a b Moore, Sam (16 May 2022). \"Matt Bellamy says Muse's 'Will Of The People' is \"a greatest hits album – of new songs\"\".

Nella sua disamina, il critico si è soffermato sulla tendenza del gruppo verso il ricalcare i propri stilemi classici, a discapito della sperimentazione che aveva caratterizzato le pubblicazioni precedenti.[24]\nTracce\n[modifica | modifica wikitesto]Testi e musiche di Matthew Bellamy.\n- Will of the People – 3:18\n- Compliance – 4:10\n- Liberation – 3:06\n- Won't Stand Down – 3:29\n- Ghosts (How Can I Move On) – 3:37\n- You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween – 3:00\n- Kill or Be Killed – 4:59\n- Verona – 4:57\n- Euphoria – 3:23\n- We Are Fucking Fucked – 3:36\nFormazione\n[modifica | modifica wikitesto]Hanno partecipato alle registrazioni, secondo le note di copertina:[25]\n- Gruppo\n- Matthew Bellamy – voce, chitarra tastiera, pianoforte, cori (traccia 1), GuitarViol (traccia 4)[26]\n- Chris Wolstenholme – basso, cori (traccia 1)\n- Dominic Howard – batteria, cori (traccia 1)\n- Altri musicisti (traccia 1)\n- Elle Bellamy – cori\n- Bing Bellamy – cori\n- Caris Wolstenholme – cori\n- Ernie Wostenholme – cori\n- Buster Wolstenholme – cori\n- Teddi Wolstenholme – cori\n- Tabitha Wolstenholme Tolhurst – cori\n- Indiana Wolstenholme Tolhurst – cori\n- Produzione\n- Muse – produzione, ingegneria del suono, direzione artistica\n- Aleks von Korff – produzione aggiuntiva, ingegneria del suono, missaggio al Red Room (traccia 7)\n- Şerban Ghenea – missaggio ai MixStar Studios (eccetto tracce 4 e 7)\n- Bryce Bordone – assistenza al missaggio ai MixStar Studios (eccetto tracce 4 e 7)\n- Chris Gehringer – mastering al Sterling Sound\n- Joe Devenney – assistenza tecnica al Red Room, missaggio al Red Room (traccia 7)\n- Andy Maxwell – assistenza tecnica agli Abbey Road Studios\n- Chris Whitemyer – assistenza tecnica\n- Paul Warren – assistenza tecnica\n- Dan Lancaster – missaggio al The Steam Room Studio (traccia 4)\n- Rhys May – assistenza al missaggio al The Steam Room Studio (traccia 4)\n- Adrian Bushby – ingegneria del suono aggiuntiva (traccia 7)\n- Jesse Less Stout – direzione creativa, direzione artistica, copertina, grafica gatefold\n- Tiago Marinho – copertina, grafica gatefold\n- Tyrone Yarde – copertina, grafica gatefold\n- Gabriella Russo – copertina, grafica gatefold\n- Nick Fancher – fotografia\n- Andrea \"Waarp\" Marcias – grafica retro e CD\nClassifiche\n[modifica | modifica wikitesto]Classifiche settimanali\n[modifica | modifica wikitesto]| Classifica (2022) | Posizione massima |\n|---|---|\n| Australia[27] | 1 |\n| Austria[27] | 1 |\n| Belgio (Fiandre)[27] | 2 |\n| Belgio (Vallonia)[27] | 1 |\n| Canada[28] | 5 |\n| Croazia[29] | 1 |\n| Danimarca[27] | 18 |\n| Finlandia[27] | 2 |\n| Francia[27] | 1 |\n| Germania[27] | 2 |\n| Giappone[30] | 20 |\n| Grecia[31] | 36 |\n| Irlanda[32] | 2 |\n| Islanda[33] | 13 |\n| Italia[27] | 1 |\n| Norvegia[27] | 16 |\n| Nuova Zelanda[27] | 1 |\n| Paesi Bassi[27] | 2 |\n| Polonia[34] | 6 |\n| Portogallo[27] | 1 |\n| Regno Unito[35] | 1 |\n| Repubblica Ceca[36] | 37 |\n| Slovacchia[37] | 51 |\n| Spagna[27] | 2 |\n| Stati Uniti[28] | 15 |\n| Svezia[27] | 27 |\n| Svizzera[27] | 1 |\n| Ungheria[38] | 3 |\nNote\n[modifica | modifica wikitesto]- ^ (EN) Neil Z.

Since a lot has happened during these years, it, thematically, explores everything from Black Lives Matter protests, to the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdowns, to the 2021 Capitol riots, and much more.\nAccording to Muse, \"Will of the People was created in Los Angeles and London and is influenced by increasing uncertainty and instability in the world. A pandemic, new wars in Europe, massive protests & riots, an attempted insurrection, Western democracy wavering, rising authoritarianism, wildfires and natural disasters and the destabilisation of the global order all informed Will of the People. It has been a worrying and scary time for all of us as the Western empire and the natural world, which we have cradled us for so long are genuinely threatened. This album is a personal navigation through those fears and preparation for what comes next.\"[5]\nIn an interview with Zane Lowe, upon announcing the album, on March 17th, 2022, Bellamy said about it, that the label originally planned them to release a best-of compilation of existing songs (later elaborating on that, saying that a \"Best-Of Album\" possibility is in their contract[6]). They instead decided to make a new album, which, musically, encapsulates and recaps the Muse's best work from past albums. As Bellamy said in an interview with a French radio station \"RTL 2\" in June of 2022, with the release of Origin of Muse and Origin of Symmetry's 20th Anniversary Remix, the band listened to a lot of their old music during the writing and recording process, and were thinking about certain things and ideas that they tried to do in the past, but they didn't work out. As an example, he mentioned Kill or Be Killed; Saying that \"2 to 3 times in our career, we've tried to create something that kind of...resembled metal or something, but we couldn't quite go there\".[7] As such, as mentioned by Bellamy on the Zane Lowe interview, the album goes \"all the way, from metal, to pop, to my first version of an Adele piano-like song, to electronica\", featuring songs like Kill or Be Killed, which is \"the best prog metal song they've ever done that could've been on Drones\", becoming a fan-favourite after just a few live performances, and We Are Fucking Fucked, which he sees as \"the weirdest, darkest lost B-side of Muse's life\", while also including songs like Liberation, which is, according to NME, a Queen-like ballad song and Verona, bringing \"purity to the nostalgic electronic textures\", as described by Warner themselves .[8]\nIn the same interview, he mentioned that he let Dom Howard take the lead in terms of decisions on this album, jokingly saying that this is why the album, from start to finish, took so long, saying that Howard took time with the process. On top of that, he added that the album was self-produced by the band themselves,[9] however it was made with help and assistance from Aleks Von Korff.\nTaking in account previous mention of Bellamy's idea of 'era blending' and 'best-of' album, Will of The People presents songs that are reminiscent of their previous albums, Will Of The People harks back to songs like Psycho and Uprising; Compliance seemingly a new feature, presents influences from the 90s with a texture from Simulation Theory; Liberation is a song that could have been released on The Resistance; Won't Stand Down, presents patterns and verses that could have been present on Origin of Symmetry with its metal influence with the strings; Ghosts (How Can I Move On), a song that could be the one that Matt described as an 'Adele type of song'; You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween, a song that could be released Simulation Theory with its 80's inspired sound ala Rockwell's Somebody's Watching Me; Kill or Be Killed, is intriguing due the mix of influences, ranging from Absolution, and Black Holes and Revelations to Drones with its metal riffs; Verona presents sounds similar the ones from The 2nd Law, like Follow Me and Madness, with its synths and U2 esque patterns and riffs; Euphoria, similar to the songs from Simulation Theory, presents synths straight out of the 70s and 80s, similar to the works of Donna Summer and Giorgio Moroder; Finally, the closer, 'We Are Fucking Fucked', presents sounds harking back to Showbiz, Origin of Symmetry and The 2nd Law with a riff similar to Knights of Cydonia.\nBackground\nAfter the Simulation Theory World Tour ended in 2019, Bellamy came up with the idea for the album, which, according to his interview with NME, was that they'd \"make it a bit more about what’s actually happening in the world right now\", adding \"what I didn’t know was what was about to happen.\" [10] Later, in January of 2020, Matt first publicly hinted at working on new Muse material in an interview with ALT 98.7 FM, backstage at the ALTerEGO Festival. He said that the goal for 2020 was to work on new Muse material. The plans were brought to halt due to the coronavirus pandemic, as the three were unable to get together due to the lockdowns. Bellamy instead focused on releasing his solo material. Later that year, in May, Matt further hinted on working on Muse material in an interview with Zane Lowe on Beats 1 Radio, saying that he has a few pieces written that are suited for Muse.[11] In an interview with Rolling Stone, also in May, he said that that the idea would be to record the album in 2021 and go on a tour in 2022.[12]\nLater, in 2021, Bellamy further confirmed that work on the new Muse album has begun, in an interview with The Jaded Hearts Club Band for The Sun.[13] Bellamy said the following: \"I started writing when all the protests and all the chaos were kicking off. It’s a weird thing to say but it suits the music I write. It keeps you a little bit on edge.\" Additionally, Bellamy jokingly said, in an Instagram comment reply on Dom Howard's Instagram post, that the album would include \"emotional gasps and many usages of the word ‘soul’.\".\nBellamy also had once got imbued with the recent label's request to release the greatest hits album of Muse's iconic songs from each eighth album they recorded, but they turned down the request and instead, they decide to produce a new album that combined with all various sounds and influences from each of their previous album into a new and fresh package with an additional comment by him as \"a greatest hits album - of a new songs - essentially\" [14] during Matt's interview with NME and the band interview with French radio talk show.\nThe album, and its release date (August 26th, 2022) was finally announced on March 17th, 2022, together with the release of Compliance. The announcement, being six months apart from the release date, was met with mixed feelings from fans, however, since then, one more song has been released, another one performed live, and the fourth song still planned to be released before the album drops. Ordering the album from the official muse.mu website gives the buyer an exclusive chance to access the ticket pre-sale code for future gigs.\nRecording\nIn a 2019 interview with NME, Bellamy said that he'd like the idea of the band \"totally resetting\" and going back to their hometown of Teignmouth, Devon to rehearse and record the album. This was, however, not the case, as the first studio pictures that started to emerge were from Bellamy's own studio, named the Red Room, located in downtown Santa Monica, California, where, in March of 2021, the first proof of Muse being in the studio came from[15] The album was both written and part-recorded in the studio. With Chris in the UK and the rest of the band in the USA, and with all the lockdowns, this was mostly done remotely. Producer Aleks Von Korff, who previously worked with Muse as an engineer on Simulation Theory, and produced Bellamy's solo material - songs like Tomorrow's World - also posted a picture from Red Room during that time, with the wooden Kawai piano.\nBetween April and June 2021, the band took a break from recording, to work on a remix of Origin of Symmetry. In early June, Matt and Dom joined Chris in the UK, continuing work on the album.[16] With the entire band back together in person, recording continued at Abbey Road Studios in London, in the summer of 2021. The band were also joined by Muse's long-time engineer, Adrian Bushby, who posted a picture of him and Howard at Abbey Road Studios tracking drums.[17] This makes the upcoming album the second LP to be partially recorded at Abbey Road, after 20 years, when Origin of Symmetry was recorded at the facility. The album appears to have also been partially recorded at RAK Studios at the end of 2021, with Tre Cool from Green Day mentioned meeting up with Muse during their stay at the studio whilst recording their album, Saviors.[18]\nOn December 1st, 2021, Chris Gehringer, mastering engineer at Sterling Sound Studios posted a picture of Bellamy and Howard sitting on a couch, with the entire album at the mastering stage during that time. [19]\nRelease\nOn December 25th, 2021, Bellamy made up for the lack of a muse.mu Christmas present with a short livestream from his Tesla, on Muse's Instagram profile, showcasing part of Won't Stand Down. The 60 second stream was then screen-recorded by a few people, with copyright bots deleting the posts, hinting at the song being near its release. Matt's minute-long stream can be listened to here. The then-approaching release of the song was teased once again on Muse's New Years Eve Instagram post, when they wrote a caption saying \"Looking forward to WSD. We'll see you on the other side!\", before quickly replacing \"WSD\" with \"2022\". Won't Stand Down was subsequently announced a week later, on January 7th, 2022, on Muse's social media[21], with wontstanddown.muse.mu spotted being online a day earlier. Together with it also came the single artwork and a new promo image of the band. The song was released on January 13th, 2022, on digital platforms.\nAlmost two months later, on March 2nd, 2022, Bellamy posted an Instagram story in which he went over the guitar tuning for Won't Stand Down, while mentioning that a second heavy song will appear on the album.[22]\nOn March 9th, 2022, Muse posted a short, half-minute album teaser video on their YouTube, simply titled \"MUSE\", which depicts statues of the band's heads being torn down by a group of rioters in the middle of a desert, while wearing mirror masks from the Won't Stand Down music video, with a choir of Matts chanting the line \"The Will of the People\", name of the album and title track, with album artwork displayed at the very end of the video.[23]\nTwo days later, on March 11th, 2022, it was discovered by Muse fans that the index code from wontstanddown.muse.mu, contains basic album info, including the tracklist and anagrams for each song which will appear on the album. The same day, Muse announced a new song/single, Compliance. The song, and its music video, leaked on March 15th through Vimeo, before being deleted from the platform on the same day. A day later, anagrams from the wontstanddown index code were also resolved, leaking song titles and the tracklist. Compliance's music video was announced together with the album name on March 16th[24].\nThe album's release date has finally been announced, together with the release of Compliance, on March 17th, 2022. It is available for pre-ordering via willofthepeople.muse.mu and is set to be released on August 26th, 2022.\nMatt reportedly said, to one of the fans after one of the London Apollo charity gigs, in May of 2022, that they intend to release two more songs before the album drops. A day after the second gig, on May 11th, Apple Music began to show the track duration for the title song, while a few days later, on May 13th, a release date for the song was set up for it on Amazon.[25] This led fans to speculate, that Will of the People would be the next single from the album. The song was later leaked on May 26th, 2022, while the official release date of June 1st was announced a day later, on May 27th.\nAfter being played on every gig of the Will of the People Summer Festivals Tour in June & July of 2022, it was announced by Muse on July 13th, 2022, that Kill or Be Killed would be the next song to be released from the album. It was released on July 21st, 2022, at 3PM BST.[26] This is also the last single before the album drop.\nDue to the fact that some people were able to get hold of the album earlier, on August 22nd, short snippets (phone recordings) of the unreleased songs from the album were leaked on Twitter, exception being We Are Fucking Fucked.[27] A day later, on August 23rd, the fifth single was announced by Muse, being You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween. The single, and it's music video, are due to be released on August 26th, together with the album.\nOn August 1st, 2022, it was announced, that Will of the People would also be releasing as an NFT, available on the platform called \"Serenade\".[28] Limited to 1000 copies, it is the first new music format to be charted in the UK since 2015, when music streaming data started counting in the charts, alongside CD, LP and download sales. The NFT cover art is slightly different to the standard one, featuring a purple/blue colour scheme, instead of the orange/blue one, and also featuring Muse's signatures on the digital cover itself.\nOn November 24th, 2022, it was announced by Muse that a new single, Ghosts (How Can I Move On), featuring Italian singer, Elisa Toffoli would be released the next day.\nOn December 9th, 2022, Ghosts (How Can I Move On) was announced to have a second single, featuring French singer, Mylène Farmer and was released simultaneously.\nCritical Reception\nAfter the release, Metacritic scored the album in 71 out of 100, indicating the generally positive and favourable reviews. It was also commercially successful to become the Muse's seventh UK No.1 album. NME described the ninth album as their \"best music in these years\" and more respectable than their previous awkward trend-chasing album \"Simulation Theory\"[29]. Won't Stand Down and Kill or Be Killed have been appointed as the greatest sounds of all Muse's track by some mainstream critics, praising the styles and bringing the best composition into this album, implying those two tracks is going to be the new Stockholm Syndrome\nCritic also spotted the last track, We Are Fucking Fucked, as a perfect closer to highlighting the straightforward lyrics that deliver the powerful chorus, which is giving a throwback to Showbiz and Black Holes and Revelations era.\nThe album was well-received amongst critics, with Kerrang rating it 4/5[30], and Riff Magazine rating it 9/10[31]. Mark Beaumont of Classic Rock Magazine also rated the album 9/10,[32] while Record Collector rated Will of the People with four stars and Gigwise gave the album a score of 8/10.[33]\nArtwork & Design\nWith Jesse Lee Stout back as their creative director, all the design and creative elements from the live shows, the music videos, and the rest of the art, are again intertwined with each other, like during Simulaiton Theory. The first design element of the album was the monogram (shown in the picture), consisting of letters \"W\", \"O\", \"T\" and \"P\". It first appeared on the single artwork for Won't Stand Down.and was already speculated at that time, that the monogram might be linked to the album name. The monogram makes appearances throughout the entirety of the album era.\nThe artwork, made by Portuguese digital artist Tiago Marinho, is set somewhere in a post-apocalyptic city, located in the middle of some desert (the design is very similar to the post-apocalyptic London, shown on the Sing for Absolution single artwork), and shows large demolished statues of the band's heads, with a group of rioters, later revealed to be the \"masked hackers\", standing next to them. The character of this \"masked hacker\", also dubbed as \"Will\" (hailing from the album's name), wears a reflective mask, which, like the monogram, also appears throughout the entire album cycle.\nOn the cover, each of the three demolished heads has graffiti sprayed all over them. These include the WOTP monograms scattered on each of the heads, aswel as names of songs. Other words written as graffiti include \"Die\" and \"Fuck off\" on Matt's head, both lines from the songs. Dom's head also includes \"IX\" written on it in Roman numerals, standing for the album being their ninth one. This is the first artwork since Black Holes and Revelations to not feature the Muse logo, or the album name on the art itself. It is also the second album artwork in a row / second main album artwork alltogether, to feature the bands' faces.\nThe story behind the album artwork is represented in the music video for the single, Will of the People.\nTouring\nOn March 20th, 2022, several fans have spotted graffiti and stickers with the, then unknown monogram, in and around the Shepherd's Bush Empire area in the Shepherd's Bush district of London, UK. It was unknown what exactly this meant at the time. Some have suggested that it was just a marketing campaign, while others have suggested a surprise show was going to take place soon.[34][35][36] Two fundraising concerts, in support of the album, were announced a week after the graffiti started to appear, on March 28th, which took place on May 9th and May 10th, at London's Eventim Apollo. Muse supported War Child & Médecins Sans Frontières on night one, and The Big Issue on night two.[37] Prior to the two shows, a very small gig, kept in complete secrecy, was performed on April 7th, 2022, at Exeter's Cavern Club. The gig was recorded for \"Jim Beam's Welcome Sessions\".\nThe Will of the People Festivals Tour was the first largest tour of the album era. It took place between summer and winter of 2022. The band headlined festivals across Europe, with an additional few gigs on U.S. festivals. The show itself, at times, loosely resembled that of Simulation Theory World Tour's, having a large Murph-inspired inflatable figure on stage, overlooking the band and the crowd, and \"The Power Glove\" returning. During the festivals tour, a smaller tour, called the Will Of The People Theatre Tour, was announced in June of 2022. On it, Muse were performing in smaller venues across Europe and the USA. Some of them haven't seen Muse perform live in almost 20 years. The tour took place during the main legs of the festivals tour, in October 2022.\nA bigger headlining tour is currently taking place, including both indoor, outdoor and festival shows. The tour began in Mexico in January of 2023, headed to North America in the spring and Europe in the summer, before finishing off in Kuala Lumpur in August of 2023.\nTracklist\nCD/Digital\n- Will of the People – 3:18\n- Compliance – 4:10\n- Liberation – 3:06\n- Won't Stand Down – 3:29\n- Ghosts (How Can I Move On) – 3:37\n- You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween – 3:00\n- Kill or Be Killed – 4:59\n- Verona – 4:57\n- Euphoria – 3:23\n- We Are Fucking Fucked – 3:36\nVinyl\nSide A (One)\n- Will of the People – 3:18\n- Compliance – 4:10\n- Liberation – 3:06\n- Won't Stand Down – 3:29\n- Ghosts (How Can I Move On) – 3:37\nSide B (Two)\n- You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween – 3:00\n- Kill or Be Killed – 4:59\n- Verona – 4:57\n- Euphoria – 3:23\n- We Are Fucking Fucked – 3:36\nCassette\nSide A\n- Will of the People – 3:18\n- Compliance – 4:10\n- Liberation – 3:06\n- Won't Stand Down – 3:29\n- Ghosts (How Can I Move On) – 3:37\nSide B\n- You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween – 3:00\n- Kill or Be Killed – 4:59\n- Verona – 4:57\n- Euphoria – 3:23\n- We Are Fucking Fucked – 3:36\nWill of the People gallery\nPersonnel\nMuse\n- Matt Bellamy - Vocals, backing vocals, crowd vocals (tracks 1, 10), guitar, guitarviol (tracks 3 & 4), keyboards, piano, synth programming, production, art direction\n- Chris Wolstenholme - Bass, backing vocals, crowd vocals (track 1), production, art direction\n- Dominic Howard - Drums, percussion, drum programming, crowd vocals (track 1), production, art direction\nAdditional performers\n- Elle Bellamy - Crowd vocals (track 1)\n- Bing Bellamy - Crowd vocals (track 1)\n- Caris Wolstenholme - Crowd vocals (track 1)\n- Ernie Wolstenholme - Crowd vocals (track 1)\n- Buster Wolstenholme - Crowd vocals (track 1)\n- Teddi Wolstenholme - Crowd vocals (track 1)\n- Tabitha Wolstenholme Tolhurst - Crowd vocals (track 1)\n- Indiana Wolstenholme Tolhurst - Crowd vocals (track 1)\nProduction\n- Aleks Von Korff - Additional production, engineering, mixing (track 7)\n- Adrian Bushby - Additional engineering (track 7)\n- Joe Devenney - Engineering assistant\n- Serban Ghenea - Mixing (tracks 1-3, 5-6, 8-10)\n- Bryce Bordone - Mixing engineer (tracs 1-3, 5-6, 8-10)\n- Dan Lancaster - Mixing (track 4)\n- Rhys May - Mixing assistant (track 4)\n- Chris Whitemyer - Technical assistant\n- Paul Warren - Technical assistant\n- Andy Maxwell - Abbey Road assistance\n- Tommy Bosustow - Abbey Road assistance\n- Chris Gehringer - Mastering\nArt\n- Jesse Lee Stout - Creative direction, artwork (gatefold)\n- Tiago Marinho - Artwork (front cover, gatefold, NFT cover)\n- Andrea “Waarp” Marcias - Artwork (back cover, poster art, LP side A)\n- Miko del Rosario - Artwork (LP side B)\n- Gabriella Russo - Artwork (gatefold)\n- Tyrone Yarde - Artwork (gatefold)\n- Nick Fancher - Photography\nNinth album recording gallery\n\"Might as well!

Il est le successeur de Simulation Theory, paru en 2018. L'album a été écrit à Los Angeles et enregistré en 2021 au studio Abbey Road à Londres, tout juste 20 ans après Origin of Symmetry, dernier album du groupe ayant été enregistré dans ce studio[2].\nLe premier single issu de l'album, Won't Stand Down, est publié le [3]. Trois autres singles sortent par la suite : Compliance, Will of the People, Kill or Be Killed puis un cinquième le jour de la sortie de l’album : You Make Me Feel Like It’s Halloween. Ghosts (How Can I Move On) sortira en Novembre 2022 en single hors album avec deux collaborations.\nAvec 10 morceaux et 37 minutes 35 secondes, il s'agit de l’album le plus court de la discographie du groupe et le premier album de l’industrie musicale à sortir au format NFT.\nDéveloppement\n[modifier | modifier le code]Après s'être essayé dans deux projets musicaux en 2020, un album avec le supergroupe The Jaded Hearts Club et des compositions en solo, Matthew Bellamy annonce dans le numéro d'août 2020 de Total Guitar et sur la page Facebook officielle du groupe le 3 août 2020 un retour en studio du groupe, probablement dès 2021, pour l’enregistrement de l'album, successeur de Simulation Theory paru en 2018. Cette fois-ci, l'album ne sera pas dirigé par Matt, mais pas Dominic Howard[4].\nÀ l’origine, Warner Bros., le label du groupe, souhaitait un best of des plus gros succès du groupe. Ce dernier refuse et Matthew Bellamy propose à la place des compositions originales qui seraient chacune la « meilleure version de chaque style ». Il déclare au média MetalZone : « Nous étions arrivés à un point où il était question de faire un album de nos plus grands succès, et nous n’étions pas vraiment en faveur de cela. Donc on a presque fait un disque qui est une compilation de nos plus grands succès – mais avec de nouvelles chansons. Cela signifie que cet album contient un morceau de Metal – et c’est comme, le meilleur morceau de Metal que nous ayons jamais fait. Et il y a une sorte de ballade douce, une chanson d’amour, et c’est probablement la meilleure ballade d’amour qu’on ait jamais faite, et ainsi de suite. »[5].\nLe , Matthew Bellamy fait un direct Instagram avec le compte du groupe à bord de sa voiture dans les rues de Los Angeles, accompagné de son fils, où il dévoile un extrait d'un morceau inédit intitulé Won't Stand Down en fond sonore. Le morceau se présente comme le plus heavy metal de la discographie du groupe[6]. Le , le titre, la pochette et la date de sortie du single sont officiellement annoncés par le groupe sur les réseaux sociaux[7].\nLe , une courte vidéo postée par le groupe sur YouTube donne des indications sur la pochette de l'album et sur les titres qui composeront celui-ci. Deux jours plus tard, le deuxième single de l'album Compliance est annoncé sur les réseaux sociaux pour une sortie le jeudi [8]. Le single Compliance est alors publié sur les plateformes de streaming. Lors de cette sortie, le groupe dévoilet officiellement la date de sortie de l'album fixé au ainsi que la pochette, les pistes de l'album et les formats de sortie.\nLe troisième single éponyme de l’album, Will of the People, sort le 1er juin 2022. Quelques jours plus tard, le groupe dévoile Kill or Be Killed, un quatrième extrait inédit de l’album lors du festival Rock am Ring en Allemagne[9], festival d’ouverture de la tournée d’été. Le titre sort officiellement le . Le , jour de la sortie de l'album, paraît You Make Me Feel Like It’s Halloween, cinquième extrait de l'album ainsi que le clip vidéo, à l'effigie des films d'horreur mythiques des années 1970-2000 comme Halloween, Scream, Vendredi 13, L'Exorciste, Misery, Shining, etc.\nLe 25 novembre 2022, sort le sixième single, Ghosts (How Can I Move On). Il est accompagné d’une face-B, une version de la chanson en duo avec la chanteuse italienne Elisa Toffoli[10],[11]. Deux semaines plus tard, une version en français sort en duo avec la chanteuse Mylène Farmer[12],[13],[14].\nL'album\n[modifier | modifier le code]Artworks (album et singles)\n[modifier | modifier le code]La pochette de l'album est dévoilée le à l’occasion de la sortie du deuxième extrait Compliance. Elle représente les têtes géantes sculptées en pierre des trois membres du groupe à moitié ensevelies et endommagées. Les visages sont tagués du monogramme « WOTP ». L’atmosphère lumineuse orangée et apocalyptique évoque un côté dramatique comme lors des incendies géants. Il s'agit du premier album depuis Black Holes and Revelations (2006) à ne pas faire apparaitre le logo du groupe sur la pochette et du deuxième album après Simulation Theory (2018) à faire apparaitre le visage des membres du groupe.\nL'artwork de Won't Stand Down représente le personnage de Kueen, vêtu d'une toge noire à capuche et un masque métallique couvrant tout son visage survolant dix disciples casqués. Le nom du groupe est inscrit au centre, sous lequel se trouve le nom du morceau ainsi qu'un monogramme formé par la superposition des lettres W, O, T et P (initiales du titre de l'album Will of the People). Ce logo se retrouve également sur les costumes des disciples dans le clip de Won't Stand Down.\nDans une courte vidéo publiée sur leur page internet le 8 mars 2022, le titre Will of the People est répété en boucle, qui correspondrait ainsi au monogramme WOTP visible dans le clip de Won't Stand Down.\nLe photographe chargé de la communication du groupe pour cet album est Nick Fancher.\nThèmes\n[modifier | modifier le code]D'après le groupe sur le réseau social Instagram dans un texte en vidéo posté le 16 mars 2022, Will Of The People a été créé à Los Angeles et à Londres. Il est influencé par l'augmentation de l'instabilité dans le monde, la pandémie du COVID-19, la guerre en Ukraine, manifestations et émeutes massives à travers le globe, une tentative d'insurrection, des démocraties occidentales vacillantes, la montée de l'autoritarisme, les catastrophes naturelles liées aux changements climatiques comme les incendies de forêt[15],[16].\nD’après Matthew Bellamy dans le magazine Metalzone à propos du premier single, « “Won’t Stand Down est une chanson qui parle de se défendre contre les brutes, que ce soit dans la cour de récréation, au travail ou ailleurs. [Cette chanson parle de] se protéger de la coercition et de la manipulation sociopathique et d’affronter l’adversité avec force, confiance et agressivité.” »[17].\nDans une vidéo publiée les , le groupe donne une définition au mot « compliance », à propos du morceau du même nom : « La compliance est une promesse de sécurité et réconfort qui nous est vendue par les puissants en temps de vulnérabilité. Les gangs, les gouvernements, les démagogues, les médias sociaux, les algorithmes et les religions nous séduisent par des tromperies de contrevérités et des fables réconfortantes. Ils veulent nous faire adhérer à leur vision étroite du monde, nous faire obéir et fermer les yeux sur nos propres voix intérieure de la raison et de la compassion. Ils ont juste besoin de notre compliance. »[8]. Cette définition donnée par le groupe établie que les entités dites « supérieures » manipulent les foules en modifiant la vision des sociétés, les idées en la modelant à leur propre valeurs, une vision étriquée et non tolérante[18].\nSonorités\n[modifier | modifier le code]L'album est principalement composé de sonorités rock et acoustiques. Il s'agit de l'album le moins électronique des dernières décennies de la discographie du groupe. Un seul morceau, Verona, est principalement électronique. Le reste de l'album alterne des chansons rock, glam rock, nu metal ou encore acoustique au piano. En avril 2021, le batteur Dominic Howard déclare que l'album « sonne lourd »[19]. Won't Stand Down, le premier extrait de l'album a des sonorités rock et Heavy metal[20].\nListe des pistes\n[modifier | modifier le code]| No | Titre | Durée | |||||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1. | Will of the People | 3:18 | |||||||\n| 2. | Compliance | 4:10 | |||||||\n| 3. | Liberation | 3:06 | |||||||\n| 4. | Won't Stand Down | 3:29 | |||||||\n| 5. | Ghosts (How Can I Move On) | 3:37 | |||||||\n| 6. | You Make Me Feel Like It’s Halloween | 3:00 | |||||||\n| 7. | Kill or Be Killed | 4:59 | |||||||\n| 8. | Verona | 4:57 | |||||||\n| 9. | Euphoria | 3:23 | |||||||\n| 10. | We Are Fucking Fucked | 3:26 | |||||||\n| 37:35 |\nFormats de l'album\n[modifier | modifier le code]La liste des titres est dévoilée le 17 mars 2022 lors de l'annonce officielle de l'album et de la sortie du single \"Compliance\" le même jour.

Ses phénomènes font référence à de nombreux films d’horreur de la culture pop[26] des années 70 et 80[27] comme Poltergeist, Vendredi 13, L’Exorciste, Scream, Saw[28] et la saga Halloween (les masques portés par les personnages)[25], mais également Ça avec les ballons rouges et l’imperméable jaune porté par le clown, accrochés au mur, dans le couloir de l’hôtel Overlook dans le film Shining[27].\nTournée\n[modifier | modifier le code]La tournée promotionnelle de l'album, le \"Will of the People World Tour\" débute en avril 2022 à Londres et se termine par la tournée des stades en Europe de Mai à Juillet 2023 et une date en Malaisie à Kuala Lumpur fin Juillet 2023.\nLes premières dates concernant la tournée promotionnelle de l'album sont annoncées en 2021.

The album was self-produced. It is a genre-hopping album that Matthew Bellamy described as \"a greatest hits album – of new songs.\"[2] \"Won't Stand Down\", \"Compliance\", \"Will of the People\", and \"Kill or Be Killed\" were released as singles before the album was released, and \"You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween\" was released as a single the same day the album came out.\nThe album received generally positive reviews and became Muse's seventh consecutive number-one album in the UK.[3] A world tour in support of the album, the Will of the People World Tour, began in April 2022 and concluded in November 2023.[4][5] It was ranked as the #17 best guitar album of 2022 by Guitar World readers.[6]\nRemove ads\nBackground and recording\nAbout the origins of the album, Matthew Bellamy related that Warner Records requested a greatest hits album from Muse, but, instead, the band decided to make an album that was a \"montage\" of \"all of those types of genres that we’ve touched on in the past\" and would feel like \"a greatest hits album – of new songs.\"[2] Warner stated that the album spans multiple genres, describing \"Will of the People\" as a \"glam rocker\" and \"Kill or Be Killed\" as \"industrial\".[7]\nBellamy said the lyrics on the album were inspired by \"the increasing uncertainty and instability in the world [...] as the Western empire and the natural world, which have cradled us for so long, are genuinely threatened. This album is a personal navigation through those fears and preparation for what comes next.\"[8]\nThe album was recorded at Bellamy's Red Room studio in Santa Monica, California,[9] as well as at Black Lodge and Abbey Road Studios in London.[10]\nRemove ads\nPromotion and release\nSummarize\nPerspective\nThe first snippet from the album was heard on 25 December 2021, when Bellamy briefly livestreamed himself and his 10-year-old son, Bing, listening to the song \"Won't Stand Down\".[11][12] About two weeks later, Muse announced the song would be released on 13 January 2022, making it their first single since \"Pressure\" in September 2018.[12] The second single from the album, \"Compliance\", was released on 17 March, alongside the announcement of the album and its release date of 26 August.[13][14]\nThe third single from the album was the title track, which was released on 1 June 2022.[4][15] That same month, Muse began the European festival leg of their Will of the People World Tour, on which they played all three of the new singles live, as well as a then-unreleased track from the album, \"Kill or Be Killed\".[16] On 21 July, \"Kill or Be Killed\" was released as the album's fourth single.[17][18] On 23 August, Muse announced that a fifth single from the album, \"You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween\", would be released on 26 August, the same day as the release of the album.[19][20]\nAn Italian-language version of \"Ghosts (How Can I Move On)\" featuring Elisa was released on 25 November 2022,[21] and a French-language version featuring Mylène Farmer was released two weeks later, on 9 December.[22]\nOn 1 August 2022, it was announced that Will of the People could be purchased as a non-fungible token (NFT) on the \"eco-friendly\" Polygon-powered platform Serenade, and that it would be the first album for which NFT sales would qualify for the UK and Australian charts.[23][24] Per The Guardian: \"The Muse NFT album will retail for £20 and will be limited to 1,000 copies globally. As both an NFT and a limited-edition format, it is relatively sparse in its offering. Buyers will get a downloadable version of the album – complete with different sleeve – as high-res FLAC files; the members of Muse will digitally sign it and each of the 1,000 buyers will have their names permanently listed on the linked roster of purchasers.\"[24]\nRemove ads\nComposition\nMusically, Will of the People has been described as glam rock,[25][26] alternative rock,[27] synth-pop,[25] arena rock,[25] hard rock,[28] progressive rock,[28] heavy metal,[29] progressive metal,[28] industrial metal,[26] and electropop.[26]\nCritical reception\nSummarize\nPerspective\nWill of the People received generally positive reviews from critics. On Metacritic, it has a normalised score of 71 out of 100 based on 14 mainstream critics, indicating \"generally favourable reviews\".[31] Neil Z. Yeung of AllMusic stated that \"While Will of the People is not as essential as their 2000s classics, it's a quick, satisfying burst of Muse essentials that cleverly forgoes the hits-compilation graveyard in favor of fresh material that honors both their evolution and dedicated fan base.\"[32] Emily Swingle of Clash described the album as \"a sharp, punchy dose of Muse...[despite] lyrics [that] can feel uninspired.\"[27] Writing for Classic Rock, Mark Beaumont wrote, \"Muse master the wider range of future rock and pop sonics they’ve been toying with for the past decade and refine and define their current sound as neatly as Black Holes & Revelations did for their 2000s period.\"[33] Emma Wilkes of DIY called the album \"A smorgasbord of dystopian-flavoured cringe.\"[34] Andrew Belt of Gigwise writes, \"Will of the People is heavy on doom-laden lyrics...Yet it also finds Muse at the top of their game — and having a ball — across ten distinctive songs.\"[35]\nRemove ads\nCommercial performance\nIn the UK, the album sold 51,500 units in its first week of release, which was enough to make it Muse's seventh consecutive album to top the UK Albums Chart.[41] In the US, with 24,000 album equivalent units, it debuted at number 15 on the Billboard 200, and number 1 on Billboard's Top Alternative Albums and Top Rock Albums charts.[42] As of January 2023, Will of the People has sold over 300,000 units worldwide.[43]\nRemove ads\nTrack listing\nAll tracks are written by Matthew Bellamy.\nPersonnel\nSummarize\nPerspective\n|\nMuse\nAdditional musicians\n|\nTechnical personnel\n|\nArtwork\n|\nRemove ads\nCharts\nSummarize\nPerspective\nRemove ads\nCertifications\nReferences\nWikiwand - on\nSeamless Wikipedia browsing.

Het album werd uitgebracht op 26 augustus 2022. De band was zelf verantwoordelijk voor de productie. Er werden vier singles uitgebracht voorafgaand aan het verschijnen van het album; 'Won't Stand Down', 'Compliance', 'Will of the People' en 'Kill or Be Killed'. De vijfde single van het album, 'You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween', werd uitgebracht op dezelfde dag dat het volledige album verscheen. Will of the People werd digitaal uitgebracht op verschillende streamingdiensten en op cd, vinyl en muziekcassette.\nAchtergrond\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]Het album werd opgenomen in Londen en Los Angeles. Volgens frontman Matthew Bellamy is het album beïnvloed door \"the increasing uncertainty and instability in the world.\" In een verklaring noemde hij onder andere de coronapandemie, oorlog in Europa (de Russische invasie van Oekraïne in 2022), grote onrust onder de bevolking en natuurrampen.[1] De band werd aangespoord om een greatest hits-album te maken, maar dat wezen de bandleden af. Will of the People bevat een mengelmoes van de verschillende genres die de band in het verleden heeft gespeeld en is in dat opzicht het antwoord geworden op het verzoek.[2]\nWill of the People World Tour\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]Op 7 april 2022 ving the Will of the People World Tour aan. Op die dag gaf de band het startschot van de tournee in de vorm van een besloten concert in Exeter.[3][4] Tot en met september werden er optredens verzorgd tijdens festivals in Europa. Vanaf oktober tot en met juni 2023 zijn er wereldwijd shows gepland. Muse wierf producer Dan Lancaster voor de liveband. Lancaster had eerder de single 'Won't Stand Down' gemixt.[5]\nOntvangst\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]Het album werd overwegend positief ontvangen. Op Metacritic kreeg Will of the People op basis van 11 recensies een gewogen gemiddelde score van 78/100, wat neerkomt op \"Generally favorable reviews\".[6] In de Benelux werd het album gematigd positief ontvangen. Zowel Alexander van Eenennaam van het Algemeen Dagblad als Gijsbert Kamer van de Volkskrant gaven twee van vijf sterren.[7][8] Floor Deckx van De Standaard gaf drie van vijf sterren.[9]\nNummers\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]| Nr. | Titel | Duur | |||||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1. | Will of the People | 3:18 | |||||||\n| 2. | Compliance | 4:10 | |||||||\n| 3. | Liberation | 3:06 | |||||||\n| 4. | Won't Stand Down | 3:30 | |||||||\n| 5. | Ghosts (How Can I Move On) | 3:36 | |||||||\n| 6. | You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween | 3:00 | |||||||\n| 7. | Kill or Be Killed | 5:00 | |||||||\n| 8. | Verona | 4:56 | |||||||\n| 9. | Euphoria | 3:23 | |||||||\n| 10. | We Are Fucking Fucked | 3:36 | |||||||\n| Totale duur: 37:35 |\nBezetting\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]- Matthew Bellamy – zang, gitaren, keyboard\n- Christopher Wolstenholme – basgitaar, zang\n- Dominic Howard – drums\nHitnoteringen\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]Nederlandse Album Top 100\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]| Hitnotering: (Week 1 t/m 7) 03-09-2022 t/m 15-10-2022 Hitnotering: (Week 8) 29-10-2022 Hitnotering: (Week 9 t/m 10) 10-06-2023 t/m 17-06-2023 | ||||||||||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Week: | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | ||\n| Positie: | 2 | 9 | 11 | 19 | 17 | 42 | 78 | uit | 94 | uit | 63 | 81 |\nVlaamse Ultratop 200 Albums\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]| Hitnotering: (Week 1 t/m 13) 03-09-2022 t/m 26-11-2022 Hitnotering: (Week 14 t/m 16) 10-12-2022 t/m 24-12-2022 Hitnotering: (Week 17) 08-07-2023 | |||||||||||||||||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Week: | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | ||\n| Positie: | 2 | 8 | 20 | 21 | 17 | 37 | 85 | 143 | 100 | 106 | 83 | 143 | 143 | uit | 150 | 125 | 129 | uit | 155 |\nExterne links\n[bewerken | brontekst bewerken]- (en) Will of the People op Discogs\n- (en) Will of the People op Muse.mu\n- (en) Will of the People op MuseWiki\n- ↑ (en) Moore, Sam, Muse announce new album ‘Will Of The People’ and share new single ‘Compliance’.

The song is intended to be a \"populist parody, almost the antithesis to 'Uprising',\" another Muse song with a similar anti-establishment theme that instead \"[takes] it seriously.\"[8]\nMusic video\neditThe music video for \"Will of the People\" was released on 1 June 2022 at 15:00 BST (UTC+1), the same day as the single was released. The music video for \"Will of the People\" follows on from the videos for previous singles \"Won't Stand Down\" and \"Compliance\", continuing the same themes and following the same characters.[4]\nThe video, directed and animated by Tom Teller,[4] is set in a dystopian city in which a revolution takes place. The video opens with a person receiving a delivery of a metallic mask, the same as the mask featured in the \"Won't Stand Down\" and \"Compliance\" music videos; he is later revealed to be Will the Hacker, the leader of the revolution. As the video progresses, a growing number of revolutionaries advance through the city,[7] destroying security cameras, spraying \"Will of the People\" logo graffiti onto walls, tearing down statues and attacking the building belonging to the Ministry of Truth,[9] in reference to George Orwell's dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four.\nAs the Ministry of Truth building explodes and continues to burn, the city's electricity supply and mobile phone signals are shut down in an attempt to smother the revolution. The leaders of the revolution depart the city in futuristic supercars,[7] resembling Tesla Cybertrucks, heading into the desert as the skyline of the city burns behind them.[7][9] In the desert the revolutionaries find three ancient statues of the faces of band members Matt Bellamy, Dominic Howard and Chris Wolstenholme carved in the style of Mount Rushmore; they are destroyed by being pulled to the ground with cables, before being covered in \"Will of the People\" logo graffiti. Three members take off their masks, revealing themselves as the members of Muse.[7][9]\nThe music video for \"Will of the People\" references multiple forms of popular culture; as well as Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, the video has been compared to \"V for Vendetta set in [the] Blade Runner 2049 universe\".[4]\nPersonnel\neditCredits adapted from Tidal.[10]\nMuse\n- Matt Bellamy – lead vocals, guitars, composition, production, engineering\n- Chris Wolstenholme – bass guitar, production, engineering\n- Dominic Howard – drums, production, engineering\nProduction\n- Aleks Von Korff – additional production, engineering\n- Chris Gehringer – mastering\n- Serban Ghenea – mixing\n- Bryce Bordone – mixing engineer\n- Andy Maxwell – studio assistant\n- Joe Devenney – studio assistant\n- Tommy Bosustow – studio assistant\n- Chris Whitemyer – technical assistant\n- Paul Warren – technical assistant\nCharts\nedit| Chart (2022) | Peak position |\n|---|---|\n| Canada Rock (Billboard)[11] | 44 |\n| Czech Republic Rock (IFPI)[12] | 12 |\n| Japan Hot Overseas (Billboard)[13] | 19 |\n| New Zealand Hot Singles (RMNZ)[14] | 25 |\n| UK Singles Sales (OCC)[15] | 96 |\n| UK Singles Downloads (OCC)[16] | 93 |\n| UK Rock & Metal (OCC)[17] | 11 |\n| US Mainstream Rock (Billboard)[18] | 23 |\nReferences\nedit- ^ \"WOTP August 26th.

The song's name has been \"officially\" leaked on March 14th, 2022 via the JSON output from wontstanddown.muse.mu, which contains basic album info. In late May of 2022, Apple Music began showing the track length of the song in the album playlist, while Amazon set up a release date of June the 1st. The song itself got leaked on May 26th, 2022, while the official release date of the single, being June 1st, was announced a day later.\nWill Of The People has previously been teased by Muse through a couple of short clips, on YouTube and Instagram, revealing the album's name. Upon the album announcement, Warner described it as a track that \"brings playful provocation to a dystopian glam-rocker\"[2]\nAccording to Matt, the song is \"like a populist parody, almost the antithesis to Uprising\", adding \"Whereas ‘Uprising’ was almost populist but taking it seriously, ‘Will Of The People’ is almost, ‘Do we know that we’re stupid now? Do we know how silly this sounds and looks?’ Inside of me, there’s always been this little bit of a conflict between the desire for direct democracy and a bit more actual power to the people, but then at the same time realising that sometimes the people can be mad… Because they’ve had no voice for so long, populism ends up becoming distorted and strange and spiting everything. People end up spiting things just because they don’t have any fucking say.\".[3]\nInstrumentation\nThe track starts out with a looping crowd, chanting the line \"The Will of the People\". The same loop appears throughout the song. The track itself is based around guitar, bass and drums, with some guitar-synth layering, which is especially noticeable during the last part. The song also features heavy use of roto-toms during the bridge part. It also features a lot of \"ooh\"s and \"woah\"s throughout the song, aswel as a high-pitched scream, at around 2 minutes and 42 seconds. The choir consists of around 150 audio tracks, all of which were put together in remote, due to all the lockdowns throughout the pandemic.[4]\nStylistically, the song is reminiscent of songs such as Uprising, Psycho and Supermassive Black Hole, featuring a similar swing-rhythm and elements of glam-rock and a punchy 50s Elvis rockabilly. The looping choir has been compared to \"The Beautiful People\" by Marilyn Manson and the songs structure has been compared to that of Green Day, sounding like 'East Jesus Nowhere'. It's also been compared to Pressure and New Kind of Kick, having the same \"rock'n'roll\" feel with the saturated vocals. The song runs in A-Major and at a tempo of 130BPM.\nThe rough layout of the riff, which appears in the pre-chorus of the song, extends all the way back to 2019, when it was played by Matt as an improv riff after Unsustainable, during the Simulation Theory Tour.\nWill of the People is one of three songs on the album to feature Jeff Buckley's Telecaster. It is used for the high bluesy leads during the choruses.\nMusic Video\nLike the song itself, the music video was also used in the teaser, following the album reveal in March of 2022. The video itself tells the story of how the heads got torn down during a riot, which can be seen on the album artwork.\nMore here.\nTrivia\nFollowing the release of the music video, Muse posted the official lyrics under the YouTube video, but similar to other lyrical mistakes in the past (such as the various misprints in the Origin of Symmetry sleeve notes), the official lyrics contain two errors. As confirmed by Aleks Von Korff on Reddit, a line from the first verse is written as “Don't need a goon to flood with devotion”, when Matt sings ”Don't need a gun to flirt with devotion”[5], while a line from the second verse, written as “We’re gonna smash this nation to pieces” is in fact “your nation”.\nThe chants/crowd vocals are not only sung by Matt Bellamy. Instead, they are sung by the entire band, together with Elle, Bing Bellamy, Chris's wife Caris and his kids, Ernie, Buster, Teddi, Tabitha and Indiana.\nLive\nPerformed live as an intro to the shows, it features a slightly extended guitar chugging intro. It was first performed live on June 4th, 2022.\nMore here.\nLyrics\nOfficial lyrics as posted by Muse, however these lyrics do contain errors as noted above.\nThe will of the people, the will of the people, the will of the will of\nThe will of the people, the will of the people, the will of the will of\nThe will of the people, the will of the people, the will of the will of\nThe will of the people, the will of the people, the will of the will of\nLet’s push the emperors into the ocean, Don’t need a goon to flood with devotion, With every hour our number increases We’ll smash your institutions to pieces\nWe need a transformation One we all can see We need a revolution So long as we stay free\nWelcome to the desecration baby We’ll build you right up then we’ll tear you down Welcome to the celebration baby The judges are jailed and the future is ours\nFree your sons and unlock your daughters We’ll throw the baby out with the bath water With every second our anger increases We’re gonna smash this nation to pieces\nWe need a transmutation One we all conceive We need a revolution So long as we stay free\nWelcome to the desecration baby We’ll build you right up then we’ll tear you down Welcome to the celebration baby The judges are jailed and the future is ours\nThe will of the people, the will of the people, the will of the will of\nThe will of the people, the will of the people, the will of the will of\nThe will of the people, the will of the people, the will of the will of\nThe will of the people, the will of the people, the will of the will of\nThe will of the people, the will of the people, the will of the will of\nThe will of the people, the will of the people, the will of the will of\nThe will of the people, the will of the sheeple, the will of the will of\nThe will of the people, the will of the people, the will of the will of\nThe will of the people, the will of the people, the will of the will of\nWelcome to the desecration, baby We'll build up you right up and we'll tear you down Welcome to the celebration, baby The judges are jailed and the future is ours\nReferences\n- ↑ https://wontstanddown.muse.mu/api/v1/catalogue/new/\n- ↑ https://themusicuniverse.com/muse-announces-will-people/\n- ↑ https://www.nme.com/big-reads/muse-cover-interview-2022-will-of-the-people-3243209\n- ↑ https://www.instagram.com/p/CeRBJolg96L/\n- ↑ https://www.reddit.com/r/Muse/comments/v3wydc/are_these_the_real_lyrics_or_did_apple_music/ib2fui1/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3", "select_response": "<think>\nThe webpage focuses specifically on the song \"Will of the People\" from the album by the same name, providing details such as the song's length, release dates, instrumentation, stylistic elements, a brief description of the lyrics, and trivia related to the song.

Four gigs were announced in total, all in the UK and all outdoor stadium gigs. As expected, more tour dates were announced throughout the following months, leading up to the tour itself. Bellamy mentioned, in an interview with Zane Lowe in August of 2022, that the tour would take place between January and July of 2023, starting in Mexico, continuing in the U.S. and Canada, and finishing in Europe.[1]\nMexico\nMexican dates were announced on October 7th, 2022. The tour included stops at Monterrey's Estadio Banorte, Guadalajara's Arena VFG and Mexico City's Foro Sol, spreading over two dates, on both 22nd and 23rd of January. The additional date in Mexico City, on 23rd, was announced on October 27th, 2022.\nThe short Mexican leg took place before the U.S. legs.\nUnited States & Canada\nTaking place after the short Mexican leg, U.S. and Canada legs exclusively featured indoor shows, with the only exception being the gig at Shaky Knees festival in Atlanta. Most tour dates were announced on September 29th, 2022. Two additional gigs in Montreal and Quebec were announced on October 6th, while additional gigs in St. Louis and Oakland were announced on October 17th.\nThe tour featured two legs and one \"lone\" show. The first leg began at Chicago's United Center on February 25th, and ended at Philadelphia's Wells Fargo Center on March 19th. The second leg started with the show at Phoenix's Desert Diamond Arena on April 2nd, ending with a gig at Salt Lake City's Vivint Smart Home Arena. The final show in the U.S. took place on May 6th, at the afforementioned Shaky Knees festival.\nEurope\nStadium gigs\nAs mentioned above, the first gigs of the tour that were announced were the UK gigs. These took place in Plymouth's Home Park on May 27th, Huddersfield's John Smith's Stadium on June 20th, Glasgow's Bellahouston Park on June 23rd and Milton Keynes's National Bowl on June 25th. The rest of the tour was announced afterwards. Additional European dates have been announced on January 20th, 2023, including the first show of the tour in Spain, in Santander's El Sardinero on July 4th, and a gig at Nancy's Zénith amphitheatre on July 6th, where they be played a headlining show, as part of the Nancy Open Air festival.\nThe rest of the European dates were announced soon afterwards. The European features Muse's first shows in the cities of Wiener Neustadt, Austria and Santander, Spain. Additionally, the show at Milton Keynes's National Bowl was Muse's first live show at the site. The last time Muse were at Milton Keynes before, was during the rehearsals for The Resistance stadium tour, in 2010. Additionally, Muse played in the city of The Hague, Netherlands after almost 23 years, and Lyon, France after about a decade.\nThe European tour featured an indoor production, scaled for an outdoor gig, and included both stadium and festival shows.\nArena gigs\nOn June 26th, the band announced indoor arena gigs for the UK and Ireland in autumn, with Nova Twins supporting.[2] The gigs announced are set to take place in Dublin's 3Arena on September 27th, Manchester's AO Arena on September 29th and London's The O2 on October 1st and 2nd.\nTravel packages\nThree travel packages were available to buy for three dates off of the European leg of the tour; Cologne (June 9th), Paris (July 8th) and Milan (July 22nd). Each travel package included, together with two tickets, a two-night stay at a hotel (king or twin bed rooms options are available). Hotels which were included are Cologne's Pullman, Paris's Marriott Ambassador and Milan's Marriott. An optional third night add-on was also included in each package, for additional cost. Additionally, two exclusive posters, commemorating Muse's performance at each venue in the city (RheinEnergieStadion in Cologne, Stade de France in Paris and San Siro in Milan) were included in each travel package, as were on-site hosts, and, for the Cologne gig, a roundtrip fare on the metro to the stadium.\nMore on the travel packages can be seen here.\nAsia\nAfter being teased on February 16th by the band on social media, the band announced the only Asian gig of the tour in Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia, on February 22nd. The open-air gig took place at the Bukit Jalil National Stadium on 29th July 2023.[3][4] The show marked the first Muse gig that took place in the country since 2007.\nSaudi Arabia\nIn 2024, Muse took time off touring to focus on families and solo projects. Despite that, two gigs took place in Saudi Arabia in December; The first one in Abu Dhabi, at F1, and another one, in Riyadh, at the Banban Festival.\nSupporting acts\nThje first support act to be announced were Royal Blood, who opened for Muse during the European open-air leg (exceptions being the Nancy and Glasgow gigs, aswell as festivals). For the U.S. shows, Evanescence were announced as the main opening act. Additional support acts for U.S. shows were announced on November 9th, 2022; One Ok Rock supported Muse during the first half of the U.S. leg (between Chicago and Philadelphia gigs), while Highly Suspect will be supporting Muse during the second half of the U.S. leg (between the Phoenix and Salt Lake City gigs).[5] On January 13th, 2023, The Warning were announced as the support act for the Mexico gigs.[6]\nOn March 22nd, both The Warning and One Ok Rock were announced as additional support acts for select European dates. The Warning supported Muse on the U.K. leg (plus one stop in Lyon, France), while One Ok Rock supported them on the rest of the European leg (excluding festivals, and the Glasgow gig). Joining the two is Twin Atlantic, who opened together with The Warning on the afforementioned Bellahouston Park gig in Glasgow.[7] A support change was made for the gig in Bern, Switzerland, as One Ok Rock couldn't perform at due to unforeseen circumstances; Replacing them was Emilie Zoé. Kyoto Protocol were announced as the support act for the Kuala Lumpur gig only a few weeks before the show itself, on July 11th, 2023.\nOn June 26th, alongside the annoucement of the UK and Ireland indoor gigs, Nova Twins were announced to be supporting Muse on these gigs.[8]\nProduction\nAs with the previous large headlining tour, the Simulation Theory World Tour, this tour features indoor, outdoor and festival shows. The stage set-up in general is a hybrid between the 2022 festivals tour and the autumn theatre tour setups. It includes an inflatable rotating figure of Will the Hacker as a backdrop, together with a grid of light fixtures, similar to the one from the theatre tour. Joining Will the Hacker is a new figure nicknamed \"Baph\".\nThe festival setup (which was also used during the Mexican leg of the tour) bears more resemblance to the 2022 summer festivals setup, with the only major difference being an addition of the lighting grid, replacing the LED strip lights behind the band. An inflatable figure of Will is present throughout the entire show, including the encore, while the setlists themselves (exceptions being the Mexican shows) include no rotations, and are more akin to the 2022 summer festivals setlists\nThe indoor setup, which premiered at the North American leg, features a stage with transparent floor, allowing for it to be illuminated from below, with an addition of a larger B-stage, six moving glass panels with lights, hung above the band, more lights on the back-grid, and, as mentioned above, an inflatable figure named \"Baph\", joining \"Will\", getting inflated for the encore. Because of the differences, the setlists for the North American shows also got \"revamped\".\nThe stage for the European outdoor setup had the same core of elements as the indoor arena setup , with an addition of two stage wings on either side, aswell as larger LED screens on both sides of the stage, equipped with light fixtures. It also featured a longer runway to the B-stage, with the B-stage itself being slightly bigger than it was for the indoor shows. \"Will\" is now equipped with a LED screen inside of his mask, an exclusive to the stadium/headlining shows, as festivals still use the older and smaller version of the figure. The full outdoor set up was officially revealed on Muse's Instagram[9], a day prior to the first gig in Plymouth, on May 26th, after pictures and videos of the stage being set up surfaced on social media a few days before.[10]\nFor the Saudi Arabia gigs in 2024, the core of the production remained the same, however, the burning WOTP logo was ditched.\nShort tour documentaries\nA series of short documentaries was set to be released throughout the tour itself, shot and edited by Muse's WOTP tour photographer Johann Ramos (known as \"The Work of Jar\") and Centreline Films, posted on Muse's YouTube channel.\nSix documentaries have been released so far. The first one is a recap of the first leg of the tour in Mexico, the second one goes over the rehearsals, which took place in California's Ontario, aswell as the Chicago show. The third one looks back at week one of the U.S. leg of the tour, the fourth one talks about the homecoming Plymouth show, and week one of the European leg, can be seen here. The fifht one shows various clips and highlights from the European stadium tour. The sixth features Matt talking about Kill or Be Killed, while showing pre-show backstage footage.\nAverage Setlist\nDuring the January leg in Mexico, the setlist remained relatively unchaged from the shows off of the 2022 festivals tour. This changed with leg 1 in the U.S., starting in Chicago, in February, when the show was updated, in turn bringing in a new setlist format. This first indoor leg in the U.S. brought in live premieres of Verona and The Dark Side (Alternate Reality Version) (Instrumental). STT Interstitials 1 and 3 returned as Simulation Theory Theme, which was played from tape, mashed up with [JFK], acting as an intro to Kill or Be Killed. Additionally, Kill or Be Killed's Felsmann + Tiley Reinterpretation version was played from tape, as an interstitial, before Compliance. Also returning after several years were Resistance, Undisclosed Desires and the shortened version of Isolated System. Assassin (Grand Omega Bosses) was also played, making this the second big headlining tour to feature Assassin, played in full since the Black Holes And Revelations Tour, with it previously being only played during The Drones World Tour 2015/16.\nWith the announcement of the Absolution XX Anniversary boxset in September of 2023, the band looks to have put an emphasis on songs off of the album during the indoor autumn leg in the UK and Ireland, with both Butterflies & Hurricanes and Apocalypse Please played on the first night of the leg in Dublin. Both songs were played for the first time in 6 years and 7 years respectively. During the leg, Stockholm Syndrome replaced Kill or Be Killed in its slot in Manchester. Space Dementia also made a return.\nThe setlist changed the most with the 2024 Saudi Arabia gigs, with the usual opener (Will ofthe People) replaced with the Simulation Theory Theme / JFK mashup (played from tape) and Won't Stand Down. Starlight was also chosen to replace Knights of Cydonia as a closer for the first time in 11 years. Bellamy's own piece Hanging in Victory Square (from the Nineteen Eighty-Four audiobook soundtrack) was also played live for the first time before Time Is Running Out.\nMexican shows set\n- Will of the People (extended intro)\n- Interlude + Hysteria\n- [Drill Sergeant] (robot voice) + Psycho\n- Pressure / Map of the Problematique / Bliss\n- Won't Stand Down\n- Stockholm Syndrome / Citizen Erased / New Born\n- The Gallery\n- Compliance\n- Thought Contagion\n- Time Is Running Out\n- You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween\n- Madness\n- We Are Fucking Fucked\n- Supermassive Black Hole\n- Plug In Baby (extended outro)\n- Behold, The Glove (Matthew Bellamy song)\n- Uprising (extended outro)\n- Prelude + Starlight\nEncore\nU.S./Canada/Ireland/UK indoor shows set\n- Will of the People (extended intro)\n- Interlude + Hysteria\n- [Drill Sergeant] (robot voice) + Psycho\n- Bliss (extended outro) / Map of the Problematique / Citizen Erased / New Born / Stockholm Syndrome / Pressure / Assassin (Grand Omega Bosses version) / Butterflies & Hurricanes (UK + Ireland only)\n- Won't Stand Down\n- Kill or Be Killed (Felsmann + Tiley Reinterpretation) (played from tape)\n- Compliance\n- Thought Contagion\n- Verona / Liberation (Canada only) / Apocalypse Please (UK + Ireland only) / Space Dementia (UK only)\n- Time Is Running Out\n- Isolated System (shortened)\n- Resistance / Undisclosed Desires\n- Toccata and Fugue in D Minor intro + You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween\n- Madness\n- We Are Fucking Fucked\n- The Dark Side (Alternate Reality Version) (instrumental)\n- Supermassive Black Hole\n- Plug In Baby (extended outro)\n- Behold, The Glove (Matthew Bellamy song)\n- Uprising (extended outro)\n- Prelude + Starlight\nEncore\n- Simulation Theory Theme (Matthew Bellamy song) (shortened) with JFK\n- Kill or Be Killed / Stockholm Syndrome (Manchester only)\n- Man With a Harmonica + Knights of Cydonia\nEU/stadium shows set\n- Will of the People (extended intro)\n- Interlude + Hysteria\n- [Drill Sergeant] (robot voice) + Psycho\n- Bliss (extended outro) / Map of the Problematique / Stockholm Syndrome\n- Resistance\n- Won't Stand Down\n- Kill or Be Killed (Felsmann + Tiley Reinterpretation) (played from tape)\n- Compliance\n- Thought Contagion\n- Verona\n- Time Is Running Out\n- Isolated System (shortened)\n- Undisclosed Desires\n- Toccata and Fugue in D Minor intro + You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween\n- Madness\n- We Are Fucking Fucked\n- The Dark Side (Alternate Reality Version) (instrumental)\n- Supermassive Black Hole\n- Plug In Baby (extended outro)\n- Behold, The Glove (Matthew Bellamy song)\n- Uprising (extended outro)\n- Prelude + Starlight\nEncore\n- Simulation Theory Theme (Matthew Bellamy song) (shortened) with JFK\n- Kill or Be Killed\n- Man With a Harmonica + Knights of Cydonia\nEU/US festival shows set\n- Will of the People (extended intro)\n- Interlude + Hysteria\n- [Drill Sergeant] (robot voice) + Psycho\n- Thought Contagion\n- Won't Stand Down\n- Kill or Be Killed (Felsmann + Tiley Reinterpretation) (played from tape)\n- Compliance\n- Time Is Running Out\n- Toccata and Fugue in D Minor intro + You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween\n- Madness\n- We Are Fucking Fucked\n- Isolated System (shortened)\n- Supermassive Black Hole\n- Plug In Baby (extended outro)\n- Behold, The Glove (Matthew Bellamy song)\n- Uprising (extended outro)\n- Prelude + Starlight\nEncore\nSaudi Arabia shows set\n- Simulation Theory Theme (Matthew Bellamy song) (shortened) with JFK\n- Interlude + Hysteria\n- Won't Stand Down\n- Resistance\n- [Drill Sergeant] (robot voice) + Psycho\n- Kill or Be Killed (Felsmann + Tiley Reinterpretation) (played from tape)\n- Compliance\n- Madness\n- Thought Contagion\n- Pressure (Abu Dhabi only)\n- Plug In Baby (extended outro)\n- Hanging in Victory Square (Matthew Bellamy song)\n- Time Is Running Out\n- Will of the People (extended intro)\n- Supermassive Black Hole\n- Toccata and Fugue in D Minor intro + You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween (Abu Dhabi only)\n- Uprising (extended outro)\n- Man With a Harmonica + Knights of Cydonia\nEncore\n- Isolated System (shortened) (Abu Dhabi only)\n- Undisclosed Desires (Abu Dhabi only)\n- Prelude + Starlight\nNotes & Exceptions\n- During the four Mexican shows, rotation slots got swapped around the setlists. Generally, the setlists for these shows were more or less the same to these of the Will of the People Festivals Tour.\n- With the start of the U.S. tour, the production was updated, in turn also changing the setlists - Scrambling songs on the setlist and changing its template, replacing The Gallery with Kill or Be Killed (Felsmann + Tiley Remix) and adding songs like Verona, The Dark Side (Alternate Reality Instrumental) and Isolated System to the sets.\n- A few gigs into the U.S. leg, Undisclosed Desires was put into rotation with Resistance.\n- Liberation was in rotation with Verona on double nights during the NA leg of the tour, which were only the second night of both Quebec City and Montreal. Verona was dropped for the UK indoor leg with Apocalypse Please and Space Dementia played in rotation in its place.\n- The Shaky Knees Festival gig featured a shorter setlist with a few changes compared to the indoor gig setlists; Thought Contagion was played earlier in the set, Isolated System was played before Supermassive Black Hole and The Dark Side (Alternate Reality)'s instrumental version and JFK / Simulation Theory Theme intro were ditched from the set. The same setlist was played at the NorthSide festival in Denmark.\n- For the stadium shows, Resistance and Undisclosed Desires were brought out of rotation and were both played at each show.\n- The stadium shows also featured less songs in the first rotation slot, these being Bliss and Map of the Problematique (with the latter only being played three times so far). Stockholm Syndrome joined the two at the Rome gig.\n- Showbiz was played instead of Knights of Cydonia at the Werchter Festival gig after technical issues meant the latter song couldn't be played. This made it the first gig in which all 9 studio albums were represented.\nStats\nGigs\n| Date | Venue | Location |\n|---|---|---|\n| 2024-12-13 | Banban (Soundstorm Festival) | Riyadh, Saudi Arabia |\n| 2024-12-08 | Du Arena (Formula 1 Grand Prix) | Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates |\n| 2023-11-04 | Foro Pegaso (Hell & Heaven Festival) | Toluca de Lerdo, Mexico |\n| 2023-10-02 | The O2 Arena | London, UK |\n| 2023-10-01 | The O2 Arena | London, UK |\n| 2023-09-29 | AO Arena | Manchester, UK |\n| 2023-09-27 | 3Arena | Dublin, Ireland |\n| 2023-07-29 | Bukit Kiara Equestrian Resort | Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia |\n| 2023-07-22 | Stadio Giuseppe Meazza | Milan, Italy |\n| 2023-07-18 | Stadio Olimpico | Rome, Italy |\n| 2023-07-15 | Stade Orange Vélodrome | Marseille, France |\n| 2023-07-12 | BernExpo Areal | Bern, Switzerland |\n| 2023-07-08 | Stade de France | Paris, France |\n| 2023-07-06 | Zénith de Nancy (Nancy Open Air) | Nancy, France |\n| 2023-07-04 | Campos de Sport de El Sardinero | Santander, Spain |\n| 2023-07-01 | Festivalpark Werchter (Rock Werchter) | Werchter, Belgium |\n| 2023-06-29 | Matmut Atlantique | Bordeaux, France |\n| 2023-06-25 | The National Bowl | Milton Keynes, UK |\n| 2023-06-23 | Bellahouston Park | Glasgow, UK |\n| 2023-06-20 | John Smith's Stadium | Huddersfield, UK |\n| 2023-06-18 | Flugplatz Neuhausen (Southside Festival) | Neuhausen ob Eck, Germany |\n| 2023-06-17 | Eichenring (Hurricane Festival) | Scheessel, Germany |\n| 2023-06-15 | Groupama Stadium | Lyon, France |\n| 2023-06-11 | Park 360 (Rock for People) | Hradec Králové, Czech Republic |\n| 2023-06-09 | RheinEnergieStadion | Cologne, Germany |\n| 2023-06-07 | Malieveld | The Hague, Netherlands |\n| 2023-06-03 | Stadion Wiener Neustadt | Wiener Neustadt, Austria |\n| 2023-06-01 | Eskelunden (NorthSide) | Århus, Denmark |\n| 2023-05-27 | Home Park | Plymouth, UK |\n| 2023-05-06 | Central Park (Shaky Knees Music Festival) | Atlanta, GA, USA |\n| 2023-04-20 | Vivint Arena | Salt Lake City, UT, USA |\n| 2023-04-18 | Climate Pledge Arena | Seattle, WA, USA |\n| 2023-04-16 | Moda Center | Portland, OR, USA |\n| 2023-04-14 | Oakland Arena | Oakland, CA, USA |\n| 2023-04-12 | Honda Center | Anaheim, CA, USA |\n| 2023-04-10 | Pechanga Arena | San Diego, CA, USA |\n| 2023-04-08 | T-Mobile Arena | Las Vegas, NV, USA |\n| 2023-04-06 | Crypto.com Arena | Los Angeles, CA, USA |\n| 2023-04-04 | Ball Arena | Denver, CO, USA |\n| 2023-04-02 | Desert Diamond Arena | Phoenix, AZ, USA |\n| 2023-03-19 | Wells Fargo Center | Philadelphia, PA, USA |\n| 2023-03-17 | Madison Square Garden | New York City, NY, USA |\n| 2023-03-15 | Centre Bell | Montreal, QC, Canada |\n| 2023-03-14 | Centre Bell | Montreal, QC, Canada |\n| 2023-03-12 | Centre Vidéotron | Québec City, QC, Canada |\n| 2023-03-11 | Centre Vidéotron | Québec City, QC, Canada |\n| 2023-03-09 | Scotiabank Arena | Toronto, ON, Canada |\n| 2023-03-07 | Nationwide Arena | Columbus, OH, USA |\n| 2023-03-05 | Chaifetz Arena | St. Louis, MO, USA |\n| 2023-03-03 | Dickies Arena | Fort Worth, TX, USA |\n| 2023-03-02 | Toyota Center | Houston, TX, USA |\n| 2023-02-28 | Moody Center | Austin, TX, USA |\n| 2023-02-26 | Target Center | Minneapolis, MN, USA |\n| 2023-02-25 | United Center | Chicago, IL, USA |\n| 2023-01-23 | Foro Sol | Mexico City, Mexico |\n| 2023-01-22 | Foro Sol | Mexico City, Mexico |\n| 2023-01-20 | Arena V.F.G. | Guadalajara, Mexico |\n| 2023-01-18 | Estadio Banorte | Monterrey, Mexico |\nSee also\nReferences\n- ↑ https://youtu.be/AMvtyphl9rA?t=2297\n- ↑ https://www.muse.mu/news/new-uk-ireland-arena-dates-323411/\n- ↑ https://www.instagram.com/p/CpMk5jDBxEG/\n- ↑ https://twitter.com/muse/status/1628321276896112641\n- ↑ https://twitter.com/muse/status/1590403848077803520/photo/1\n- ↑ https://www.instagram.com/p/CnXcXiNNSFy/\n- ↑ https://twitter.com/muse/status/1638587091020914713/photo/1\n- ↑ https://www.muse.mu/news/new-uk-ireland-arena-dates-323411/\n- ↑ https://www.instagram.com/p/Csuf6rlqKCS/\n- ↑ https://www.instagram.com/p/CsZn26TSifb/", "select_response": "<think>\nThe purpose of this search round is to gather comprehensive information about the album, which includes basic album information, commercial performance, critical reception, and public impact.

It was released on 21 July 2022 as the fourth single ahead of their ninth studio album Will of the People, having already debuted in live format during festival shows of their Will of the People World Tour. It was nominated for Best Metal Performance at the 65th Annual Grammy Awards.\nRelease history\n[edit]\"Kill or Be Killed\" was debuted in live format at the 4 June 2022 show of the Will of the People World Tour, at the Rock am Ring music festival in Germany, during which the previous single \"Will of the People\" also received its live debut. \"Kill or Be Killed\" was played as the first song of the encore, before the closing song \"Knights of Cydonia\", and without any official prior announcement from the band.[1]\n\"Kill or Be Killed\" was subsequently played at every following show of the tour, emerging as a fan favourite. On 14 July, Muse confirmed through social media that \"Kill or Be Killed\" would be released as the fourth single ahead of Will of the People one week later on 21 July 2022, with a thirty-second snippet of the studio version of the song becoming available to preview through TikTok later that day.[2]\nWriting and composition\n[edit]Prior to the live debut of \"Kill or Be Killed\", in an interview with Apple Music 1 on 17 March 2022, Matt Bellamy described \"Kill or Be Killed\" as \"the best metal/prog track we've ever done\", featuring \"industrial-tinged, granite-heavy guitar riffs\".[3] Music journalists described \"Kill or Be Killed\" as progressive metal,[4][5] heavy metal,[6] alternative metal,[7] and metalcore.[8]\nFor the guitar solo, Bellamy combined a tapping technique with a DigiTech Whammy, a pitch-shifting pedal, to shift rapidly between octaves. He said, \"I'm plainly cheating in that solo ... It sounds like I’m doing insane arpeggios. I'm not a shredder at all. I've never been a very good shredder, but I found ways to cut corners.\"[9]\nCharts\n[edit]| Chart (2022) | Peak position |\n|---|---|\n| UK Singles Sales (OCC)[10] | 81 |\n| UK Singles Downloads (OCC)[11] | 80 |\n| UK Rock & Metal (OCC)[12] | 20 |\n| US Rock Airplay (Billboard)[13] | 37 |\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ Shutler, Ali (5 June 2022). \"Watch Muse perform new song 'Kill Or Be Killed' as they kick off summer tour\".

At the end, it is revealed that three of the rioters are infact the \"dicators\" (the band), which appear to be rioting against themselves. In the words of Matt Bellamy, \"\"Will of the People\" is fictional story set in a fictional metaverse on a fictional planet ruled by a fictional authoritarian state run by a fictional algorithm manifested by a fictional data centre running a fictional bank printing a fictional currency controlling a fictional population occupying a fictional city containing a fictional apartment where a fictional man woke up one day and thought \"fuck this.\"\"[1]\nThe song's music video itself, being that of the title track, contains alot of elements which are seen in the album artwork. It was also previously used as a short teaser for the album announcement, in March of 2022.[2]\nAdditional information\nThe video was directed by Tom Teller and produced by Frame 48. The same production company also handled post-production and VFX for both the Simulation Theory Film and all of Simulation Theory's music videos, with Tom Teller as executive director on all projects.

The Will of the People Festivals Tour took place between June 2022 and January 2023. This was the first tour of the Will of the People era, and first tour in three years, since the pandemic of 2020.\nInformation\nThe tour began one month after the WOTP promo gigs, and first gigs since 2019 alltogether, in Exeter's Cavern Club and London's Apollo gigs, on June 4th, 2022, with a performance at Rock am Ring in Germany. As mentioned above, this was the first major tour, supporting the album, Will of the People. The tour included Muse's debut performances at Nova Rock, Aftershock and Audacy Beach festivals, aswell as performances at the Isle of Wight, Eurockéennes and Rock in Rio Lisbon festivals, amongst others. The tour also included a special, more intimate invite-only gig, at the James B. Beam Distillery in Kentucky, when Muse played a gig as part of Jim Beam Welcome Sessions.\nWill of the People and Kill or Be Killed made their live debuts on the first leg of the tour, with Compliance and Won't Stand Down being played on the couple gigs before the tour. You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween made its debut on the second leg of the tour, in September. Nishe was brought back after 11 years, played before Madness, and also played in full for the first time since 2000. A Bellamy solo song, Behold, The Glove, returned, after last being present during the Simulation Theory World Tour in 2019, when it was played from tape as a short intro piece (then known as STT Interstitial 2). On this tour, the song was played in full, with the entire band.\nThe day before the first gig, on June 3rd, 2022, the entire tour's setlist template was leaked on Twitter.\nProduction\nThe show was, in some aspects, similar to the afforementioned previous tour. Similar to Murph the Robot, the tour featured its counterpart, a large inflatable \"masked hacker\" figure, nicknamed \"Will the Hacker\", which was set up on-stage behind the band, and was present throughout most of the show (excluding the fist few songs). It was revealed during Won't Stand Down. The main difference between Will the Hacker and Murph is that the hacker was a lot bigger and bulkier. It's made up of three separate parts: Two shoulders, sitting on each side of the head, which was attached to trussing, rotating left to right slightly. Behind the hacker were two thin walls of LED light strips, also attached to top trussing. Lights were used to illuminate the inflatable figure from different angles throughout the show.\nAlso similar to the Simulation Theory Tour was the use of The Power Glove. The difference, however, is, that, the new glove acted as an instrument, with a built-in smartphone, connected to the PA system, using a synthesizer app called \"NOISE\". Matt played Behold, The Glove and the synth intro of Uprising on the glove. While doing so, Bellamy wore an illuminating LED leather jacket, similar to the jacket worn during the previous tour.\nKeeping with the heavier style of the new songs, the gigs relied on heavy use of pyro, specifically, fire. The show opened with a large burning \"WOTP\" monogram logo, placed behind the band, while they play the song Will of the People. The fire can be re-ignited quickly at any given time, with the ability to lit up each letter separately. Fire machines are used throughout the rest of the show, during Won't Stand Down, Madness, Thought Contagion, Uprising, Kill or Be Killed and (later on during the tour) Knights of Cydonia.\nThree video interstitials, named \"Chant\", \"Parkour\" and \"Driving\" were played during the show. These included elements from Will of the People's music video. The \"Chant\" one was played before Will of the People, and showed the video of the stone heads being torn down, seen during the last part of the music video, and also in the album trailer, posted on Muse's YouTube channel. The \"Parkour\" one showed the rioter running and jumping over buildings, as seen during the music video's first part, and is played before Time Is Running Out. The \"Driving\" interstitial showed the vehicles from the music video being driven through the desert, and was played before Plug In Baby.\nWith Mercy being dropped from the setlists, Compliance took over as the song during which streamers are released.\nOn some dates, due to the logistics, some elements of the production weren't present on all gigs, or were swapped. This notably happened for the Lisbon gig at Rock in Rio, when the main production was headed to London, so the band were forced to use a minimal stage setup, which included replacing the figure of Will the Hacker with Murph the Robot, ditching the \"WOTP\" logo at the start, and changing the band's wardrobe. The same (or similar) minimal stage set-up was also present during the Telekom Street Gigs show in Cologne, Audacy Beach Festival in Fort Lauderdale and the iHeartRadio ALTer EGO in Los Angeles, while the burning logo itself didn't appear in Florence, at Firenze Rocks.\nAverage Setlist\n- Will of the People (extended intro)\n- Interlude + Hysteria\n- [Drill Sergeant] (robot voice) + Psycho\n- Pressure\n- Won't Stand Down\n- Map of the Problematique / Stockholm Syndrome / Citizen Erased\n- The Gallery\n- Compliance (w/ guitar)\n- Thought Contagion\n- Time Is Running Out\n- Nishe (shortened)\n- Madness\n- Supermassive Black Hole\n- Plug In Baby (extended outro)\n- Behold, The Glove (Matthew Bellamy song)\n- Uprising (extended outro)\n- Prelude + Starlight\nEncore\nNotes\n- Map of the Problematique and Stockholm Syndrome share their outro riffs, being Duality, Calm Like a Bomb and the Unknown one, although they shuffle through them gig by gig.\n- Nishe was initially only played as a short 1-minuite snippet, but it was later extended to almost 2 minutes after the third show.\nExceptions\n- Citizen Erased was played at the Rock am Ring gig as an extra song after Madness while Map of the Problematique was played in the rotation slot.\n- For the first 4 shows of the tour, Thought Contagion was played between Supermassive Black Hole and Plug in Baby.\n- At the Isle of Wight Festival, Won't Stand Down was played after the rotation slot while Citizen Erased was played in said slot.\n- You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween got its debut at Xacobeo Festival. It was played after Thought Contagion and replaced the MOTP/Stockholm Syndrome/Citizen Erased slot and was played there through September.\n- Tributing Queen Elizabeth II after her passing, \"God Save the Queen\" was played briefly at Xacobeo Festival, before Interlude.\n- Telekom Street Gigs, James B. Beam Distillery had notably shorter setlists, with Thought Contagion, Time Is Running Out, Nishe and Madness all being dropped with no replacement and some of the remaining songs were shuffled around. The only setlist difference between the two (other than the order of the songs) is that Behold, The Glove was played at the former while Minimum was played at the latter. The 2023 iHeartRadio gig at Los Angeles+s The Kia Forum had the shortest setlist of all shows, with just nine songs, being Will of the People, Hysteria, Won't Stand Down, Madness, Compliance, Supermassive Black Hole, Behold The Glove, Uprising and Starlight, which was the closer.\n- Aftershock Festival had a notably heavier setlist, with Stockholm Syndrome replacing Pressure, We Are Fucking Fucked replacing the summer rotation slot, New Born replacing Compliance, You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween replacing Thought Contagion, Minimum replacing Nishe and Madness being dropped with no replacement.\nStats\nGigs\n| Date | Venue | Location |\n|---|---|---|\n| 2023-01-14 | The Kia Forum (iHeartRadio ALTer EGO) | Los Angeles, CA, USA |\n| 2022-12-03 | Fort Lauderdale Beach (Audacy Beach Festival) | Fort Lauderdale, FL, USA |\n| 2022-10-09 | Discovery Park (Aftershock Festival) | Sacramento, CA, USA |\n| 2022-10-08 | James B.

The first of two gigs that took place in 2024.\nInformation\nAnnounced on April 23rd, 2024, Muse performed at Abu Dhabi's Du Arena/Etihad Park, as part of the Yasalam F1 Post-Race Concerts, on December 8th, 2024. This was Muse's second time performing at the venue and at the event itself, with their first Yasalam post-race concert taking place in 2013.\nThe Show\nStaging-wise, the setup remained more or less the same as the festival production from the previous year but with some alterations; the burning \"WOTP\" sign was not present during the opening song, the flamethrowers were notably smaller than before, and the b-stage truss was much shorter. Will the Hacker was present however and was revealed during Compliance, the same way as during the arena shows of the Will of the People World Tour. Also notably, Matt used his Manson Chrome FR guitar for the majority of the show.\nWhile the length of the setlist echoed the previous festivals one, there were lots of changes to the order of the songs:\n- Simulation Theory Theme / JFK opened the show. The final line of the speech was edited (persumably by AI) to say \"Women will be what she was born to be\" instead of the original line. It was followed by Won't Stand Down which hadn't been played as the first song of a show since May 2022\n- Resistance, Madness, and Plug in Baby were all played earlier in the show than usual, while Will of the People was played later than usual.\n- Matt returned to playing the end of Compliance on guitar, something he's not done since January 2023.\n- Pressure was played for the first time since March 2023.\n- Hanging in Victory Square (from the Nineteen Eighty-Four score co-composed by Matt) was played live for the first time before Time is Running Out\n- Behold, The Glove was not played as an intro to Uprising for the first time since October 2022\n- The main set closed with Knights of Cydonia. Afterwards an unexpected encore was played consisting of Isolated System, Undisclosed Desires and Starlight. Matt wore his LED jacket during the whole encore, and confetti and streamers were released during the last chorus of Starlight.\nMedia\nYou can watch individual songs which were fan-recorded with the links below.\nSetlist\n- Simulation Theory Theme (shortened)\n/JFK + Won't Stand Down [watch]\n(Manson Oryx, satin graphite finish Status Stealth headless 5-string) - Interlude + Hysteria + Back in Black outro\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Resistance [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Drill Sergeant (robot voice) + Psycho\n(Manson Matt Black FR, woven chrome finish tricolor-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Kill or Be Killed (Felsmann + Tiley Reinterpretation)\n- Compliance (w/ guitar ending)\n(Manson Chrome FR, satin black Fender Jazz Bass) - Madness\n(Manson TronCaster, Status Kitara Doubleneck Bass Mk2) - Thought Contagion\n(Manson Chrome FR, satin black Fender Jazz Bass) - Pressure\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Plug In Baby (extended)\n(Manson Mirror, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Hanging in Victory Square [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Time Is Running Out [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Will of the People (extended) [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Supermassive Black Hole [watch]\n(Manson M1D1 Stealth, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Toccata and Fugue in D Minor intro + You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR 2.0, satin graphite finish Status Stealth headless 5-string) - Uprising (extended)\n(Manson Fire Red, woven chrome finish tricolor-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Man With a Harmonica + Knights of Cydonia [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass)Encore\n- Isolated System (shortened)\n- Undisclosed Desires [watch]\n(graphite finish Status The KingBass Mk-II) - Prelude + Starlight [watch]\n(graphite finish blue-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass)", "select_response": "<think>\nThe webpage provides detailed information about an upcoming concert by Muse at Abu Dhabi's Du Arena on December 8, 2024.

To access the pre-sale code, members account must've been createad prior to September 19th, 2022.\nMuse were supported by Evanescence and One Ok Rock.\nThe Show\nThe Setlist\n- The setlist overall remained somewhat similar to both the Mexican leg and the festival tour the previous year - but with numerous changes and additions.\n- Verona and Kill or Be Killed's Felsmann + Tiley remix both made their live debuts. The latter song was played from tape as an intro to Compliance early into the setlist, replacing The Gallery which was played previously.\n- The Dark Side's Alternate Reality Instrumental version was also played live for the first time, featuring Matt on slide guitar while sitting on Will the Hacker's shoulder.\n- Isolated System and Resistance were both played for the first time since 2018. The former song featured all new audio and news excerpts made to match the themes of the Will of the People album.\n- The Simulation Theory Theme also made its return for the first time since the end of the Simulation Theory World Tour. This time the speech was combined with JFK (marking the latter's first live appearance since 2016), and was used as an interstitial at the start of the encore before Kill or Be Killed.\n- The Cherub Rock riff was played in a similar fashion to the 2018 and 2019 Chicago gigs, as a tribute to Smashing Pumpkins. Also during the outro of Supermassive Black Hole, Matt played a sped up version of Limp Bizkit's 'Just Like This' riff.\nProduction and Staging\n- The staging and production again remained similar to a certain extent to previous legs, but was livened up a bit in various ways.\n- The stage was similar (but albiet simpler) to the Simulation Theory World Tour. It featured the usual square stage shape with a catwalk to a b-stage, which featured a sinking floor. The stage uniquely featured a transparent floor which allowed light rigs to be placed below the band (it's effect is best seen during We Are Fucking Fucked)\n- The stage featured the burning \"WOTP\" sign at the start as before, though following the end of Will of the People the curtain that covered the back of the stage was instead lowered manually rather than being dropped. Said curtain was also plain black rather than patterned.\n- As before, the band members all wore masks during Will of the People - additionally Dom also wore his during Isolated System and Matt wore his during Behold, The Glove.\n- The \"Will the Hacker\" inflatable was once again prominently featured, albeit it was instead revealed during the Kill or Be Killed Felsmann + Tiley remix, rather than during Won't Stand Down like previous shows. Will remained onstage until The Dark Side (Alternate Reality Instrumental), when the back of the stage was covered once again and remained covered until the end of the main set.\n- At the start of the encore, the curtain was lifted once again to reveal the new, second inflatable; a massive demon-like figure called \"Baph\". Baph is much taller than Will and additionally featured arms on each side of the stage and an ability to light-up its skeleton and eyes.\n- Fire cannons were once again prominently used throughout the show, though they were now placed behind the band and on each side of the stage, as opposed to being located along the front of the stage.\n- The stage also included six overhead LED light structures covered with mirrors, that were able to move up and down and form different shapes above the band during the second half of the show. The structures also have flamethrowers on their backs, which were used during the Uprising solo.\n- Between We Are Fucking Fucked and The Dark Side, 3 actors came on stage dressed as the band members and wearing the Compliance video masks. They walked to the b-stage before being lowered down and exiting the stage.watch watch\n- Streamers were released during Compliance, while confetti was released during Verona. Rain confetti was also released during Isolated System.\nTimetable\n- 16:30 - Concert club doors [9]\n- 17:30 - General admission\n- 18:30 - One Ok Rock\n- 19:30 - Evanescence\n- 21:00 - Muse\nMedia\nThe official aftermovie can be seen here.\nSetlist\n- Will of the People (extended) [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Interlude + Hysteria + Cherub Rock\nriff [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Drill Sergeant (robot voice) + Psycho [watch]\n(Manson Matt Black FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Bliss (extended) [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Kill or Be Killed intro + Won't Stand Down [watch]\n(Manson Oryx, stealth finish Status S2-Classic 5-string) - Kill or Be Killed (Felsmann + Tiley Reinterpretation) [watch]\n- Compliance [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, satin black Fender Jazz Bass) - Thought Contagion [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, satin black Fender Jazz Bass) - Verona [watch]\n(Manson MB S-Prototype, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Time Is Running Out [watch]\n(Manson MB-1 Blue, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Isolated System (shortened) [watch]\n- Resistance [watch]\n(Manson MB-1 Blue, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Toccata and Fugue in D Minor intro + You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR 2.0, stealth finish Status S2-Classic 5-string) - Madness [watch]\n(Manson MB-1 Blue, Status Kitara Doubleneck Bass Mk2) - We Are Fucking Fucked [watch]\n(Manson Matt Black 3.0 #2, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - The Dark Side (Alternate Reality Version) (Instrumental) [watch]\n(Manson MB S-Prototype) - Supermassive Black Hole w/ Just Like This riff [watch]\n(Manson M1D1 Stealth, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Plug In Baby (extended) + Sweet Child O' Mine\nriff [watch]\n(Manson Mirror 2.0, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Behold, The Glove\n(aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Uprising (extended) [watch]\n(Manson Red Alert, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Prelude + Starlight\n(graphite finish red-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass)Encore\n- Simulation Theory Theme (shortened)\n/ JFK + Kill or Be Killed [watch]\n(Manson Oryx, stealth finish Status S2-Classic 5-string) - Man With a Harmonica + Knights of Cydonia [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass)\nGallery\nMatt on Will's shoulder during The Dark Side's Alternate Reality Version\nReferences\n- ↑ https://twitter.com/muse/status/1575485906123104258/photo/1\n- ↑ https://twitter.com/muse/status/1575485906123104258/photo/1\n- ↑ https://twitter.com/muse/status/1575485906123104258/photo/1\n- ↑ https://twitter.com/muse/status/1590403848077803520/photo/1\n- ↑ https://www.reddit.com/r/Muse/comments/11arlmb/us_tour_starts_tomorrow/\n- ↑ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Center\n- ↑ https://www.ticketmaster.com/muse-will-of-the-people-tour-chicago-illinois-02-25-2023/event/04005D3315B43BD4\n- ↑ https://www.reddit.com/r/Muse/comments/11arlmb/us_tour_starts_tomorrow/\n- ↑ https://www.unitedcenter.com/events/2023/02/25/muse-will-of-the-people-tour/", "select_response": "<think>\nThe webpage provides detailed information about a specific gig of Muse as part of their \"Will of the People World Tour\" held at the United Center in Chicago on February 25, 2023.

The first of two gigs that took place in 2024.\nInformation\nAnnounced on April 23rd, 2024, Muse performed at Abu Dhabi's Du Arena/Etihad Park, as part of the Yasalam F1 Post-Race Concerts, on December 8th, 2024. This was Muse's second time performing at the venue and at the event itself, with their first Yasalam post-race concert taking place in 2013.\nThe Show\nStaging-wise, the setup remained more or less the same as the festival production from the previous year but with some alterations; the burning \"WOTP\" sign was not present during the opening song, the flamethrowers were notably smaller than before, and the b-stage truss was much shorter. Will the Hacker was present however and was revealed during Compliance, the same way as during the arena shows of the Will of the People World Tour. Also notably, Matt used his Manson Chrome FR guitar for the majority of the show.\nWhile the length of the setlist echoed the previous festivals one, there were lots of changes to the order of the songs:\n- Simulation Theory Theme / JFK opened the show. The final line of the speech was edited (persumably by AI) to say \"Women will be what she was born to be\" instead of the original line. It was followed by Won't Stand Down which hadn't been played as the first song of a show since May 2022\n- Resistance, Madness, and Plug in Baby were all played earlier in the show than usual, while Will of the People was played later than usual.\n- Matt returned to playing the end of Compliance on guitar, something he's not done since January 2023.\n- Pressure was played for the first time since March 2023.\n- Hanging in Victory Square (from the Nineteen Eighty-Four score co-composed by Matt) was played live for the first time before Time is Running Out\n- Behold, The Glove was not played as an intro to Uprising for the first time since October 2022\n- The main set closed with Knights of Cydonia. Afterwards an unexpected encore was played consisting of Isolated System, Undisclosed Desires and Starlight. Matt wore his LED jacket during the whole encore, and confetti and streamers were released during the last chorus of Starlight.\nMedia\nYou can watch individual songs which were fan-recorded with the links below.\nSetlist\n- Simulation Theory Theme (shortened)\n/JFK + Won't Stand Down [watch]\n(Manson Oryx, satin graphite finish Status Stealth headless 5-string) - Interlude + Hysteria + Back in Black outro\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Resistance [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Drill Sergeant (robot voice) + Psycho\n(Manson Matt Black FR, woven chrome finish tricolor-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Kill or Be Killed (Felsmann + Tiley Reinterpretation)\n- Compliance (w/ guitar ending)\n(Manson Chrome FR, satin black Fender Jazz Bass) - Madness\n(Manson TronCaster, Status Kitara Doubleneck Bass Mk2) - Thought Contagion\n(Manson Chrome FR, satin black Fender Jazz Bass) - Pressure\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Plug In Baby (extended)\n(Manson Mirror, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Hanging in Victory Square [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Time Is Running Out [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Will of the People (extended) [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Supermassive Black Hole [watch]\n(Manson M1D1 Stealth, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Toccata and Fugue in D Minor intro + You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR 2.0, satin graphite finish Status Stealth headless 5-string) - Uprising (extended)\n(Manson Fire Red, woven chrome finish tricolor-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass) - Man With a Harmonica + Knights of Cydonia [watch]\n(Manson Chrome FR, aqua blue finish white-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass)Encore\n- Isolated System (shortened)\n- Undisclosed Desires [watch]\n(graphite finish Status The KingBass Mk-II) - Prelude + Starlight [watch]\n(graphite finish blue-LED Status Chris Wolstenholme Signature Bass)", "select_response": "<think>\nThe webpage provides detailed information about an upcoming concert by Muse at Abu Dhabi's Du Arena on December 8, 2024.

The latter song was played from tape as an intro to Compliance early into the setlist, replacing The Gallery which was played previously.\n- The Dark Side's Alternate Reality Instrumental version was also played live for the first time, featuring Matt on slide guitar while sitting on Will the Hacker's shoulder.\n- Isolated System and Resistance were both played for the first time since 2018. The former song featured all new audio and news excerpts made to match the themes of the Will of the People album.\n- The Simulation Theory Theme also made its return for the first time since the end of the Simulation Theory World Tour. This time the speech was combined with JFK (marking the latter's first live appearance since 2016), and was used as an interstitial at the start of the encore before Kill or Be Killed.\n- The Cherub Rock riff was played in a similar fashion to the 2018 and 2019 Chicago gigs, as a tribute to Smashing Pumpkins. Also during the outro of Supermassive Black Hole, Matt played a sped up version of Limp Bizkit's 'Just Like This' riff.\nProduction and Staging\n- The staging and production again remained similar to a certain extent to previous legs, but was livened up a bit in various ways.\n- The stage was similar (but albiet simpler) to the Simulation Theory World Tour. It featured the usual square stage shape with a catwalk to a b-stage, which featured a sinking floor. The stage uniquely featured a transparent floor which allowed light rigs to be placed below the band (it's effect is best seen during We Are Fucking Fucked)\n- The stage featured the burning \"WOTP\" sign at the start as before, though following the end of Will of the People the curtain that covered the back of the stage was instead lowered manually rather than being dropped. Said curtain was also plain black rather than patterned.\n- As before, the band members all wore masks during Will of the People - additionally Dom also wore his during Isolated System and Matt wore his during Behold, The Glove.\n- The \"Will the Hacker\" inflatable was once again prominently featured, albeit it was instead revealed during the Kill or Be Killed Felsmann + Tiley remix, rather than during Won't Stand Down like previous shows. Will remained onstage until The Dark Side (Alternate Reality Instrumental), when the back of the stage was covered once again and remained covered until the end of the main set.\n- At the start of the encore, the curtain was lifted once again to reveal the new, second inflatable; a massive demon-like figure called \"Baph\". Baph is much taller than Will and additionally featured arms on each side of the stage and an ability to light-up its skeleton and eyes.\n- Fire cannons were once again prominently used throughout the show, though they were now placed behind the band and on each side of the stage, as opposed to being located along the front of the stage.\n- The stage also included six overhead LED light structures covered with mirrors, that were able to move up and down and form different shapes above the band during the second half of the show. The structures also have flamethrowers on their backs, which were used during the Uprising solo.\n- Between We Are Fucking Fucked and The Dark Side, 3 actors came on stage dressed as the band members and wearing the Compliance video masks. They walked to the b-stage before being lowered down and exiting the stage.watch watch\n- Streamers were released during Compliance, while confetti was released during Verona.

They are seen jumping and running around the massive stage and its catwalk.\nThe track has nods to artists like Bikini Kill, with Halsey yelling: “Yes, sir, no, sir, on all fours/Are you ready to get what you’ve been waiting for?/I’m not a criminal, I’m just a wild child/I’m not a bad girl, I just like it wild style/I’m tough, I’m mean, I’m rough/Just say the safe word when you’ve had enough,” during the chorus.\n“I don’t gotta listen to you/ You’re not thе boss of me!”\nElsewhere in her 18-track setlist, Halsey treated fans to a variety of songs from her discography.

Find Muse tour …\nContent: 10/10\nby naze on 5/22/24Rating: 5 out of 5cool show! would definitely go back and watch everything again\nThere are no upcoming concerts in United States\nDon't worry, there are other concerts available below\nMuse in Concert\nArmed with guitars, synths, and one killer falsetto, British rockers Muse have been playing and performing like it's the end of the world since the mid-1990s. The trio of lead vocalist and guitarist Matt Bellamy, bassist Chris Wolstenholme, and drummer Dominic Howard first came together in Devon, England, as goth band Rocket Baby Dolls. At the time, their riveting showmanship on stage was already starting to show: In 1994, they won a local \"battle of the bands\" contest, switched their name to the trimmer and tidier Muse, and have since skyrocketed into one of the most electrifying stadium acts in the world.\nOver their first few years, they played gigs around England and eventually recorded their first set of material, a self-titled EP, in 1998. But it wasn't until follow-up EP ‘Muscle Museum' that they first reached the NME Indie Singles Chart, and started accumulating comparisons to Radiohead. Their 1999 debut album ‘Showbiz' would follow, and its sci-fi-inspired alt-rock landed them on numerous European charts. Muse's bombastic eclecticism would only grow from here. Their next round of albums incorporated more touches of classical music, church organs, Mellotrons, and various experimental effects, and by their third album, ‘Absolution,' they'd kicked off a consistent streak of topping the U.K. charts.\nSince 2006's ‘Black Holes and Revelations,' they began to conquer the U.S. as well, and their live shows became more and more extravagant as their music became more and more dystopic. The high-tech worldwide tours backing 2009's ‘1984'-inspired ‘The Resistance' and 2012's ‘The Second Law' would prove them to be a must-see event, with massive light displays and film projections, pyrotechnics, and even an LED suit for Bellamy. Their next album, ‘Drones,' scored them a Grammy Award for Best Rock Album in 2015, and gave them a good reason to incorporate real drones into their Drones Tour. Muse would continue on the surreal sci-fi path with 2018's synth-pop release ‘Simulation Theory' and a 2019 tour — quite possibly their most mind-blowing yet.\nEncore\nEncore\nEncore\nEncore\ncool show! would definitely go back and watch everything again\nMuse's concert was INSANE! The visuals, the sound, the energy – it was all off the charts. An absolute rock revolution that blew my mind! 🤩🎤🎶\nI’ve seen Muse in concert around 7 times, and they kill it every time! They’re amazing performers and they sound outrageous, Live! Every time they’re in N.Y, I make sure to go see them! Love them :-)\nAbsolutely amazing. They killed it. They really go all out. Definitely want to see them again.\nThis was more than a concert, it was full-on performance, explosive and energetic, memorable and impactful. Seamless stream of music and lights and confetti and fire. I'm generally too shy to be very vocal in social settings like this, but I had no voice after this concert as I couldn't help but join in the singing and screaming with excitement. How cool to have that experience in a room full of thousands of other fans all collectively vibing with the band together. It was so amazing, I want to do it again!\nThis is the first time I have seen Muse. Absolutely, phenomenal performance. Great sound. Great light show. Everything. Solid.\nIt was an amazing show with a great line up, Highly Suspect and Evanescence were amazing. Muse went over the top (in a great way), If was more than just preforming music, they created a whole show to go with their music. I would see them again.\nMuse is one of the best bands, a new experience of Rock, very unique style, sound, lyrics, everything! Best of the best!!!\nI’m always be in love with their rock style and the way Matthew is singing and April was my lucky month which could see them in concert . It’s ridiculous how good they are..They were brilliant and full of energy. Their performance absolutely awesome they are one of the best rock band🏻\nMy inner high school emo self was SO happy!! The girl next to me and I were in happy tears at some point reliving our high school emo days.

The show was short but a very good one! The singer, Ricky Wilson, is very charismatic and an excellent dancer!\nAbout Muse - Tour Simulation Theory:\nthe sound was very good, the instruments were heard in good frequency and also the voices.\nThe band has a strong connection on stage and a great dynamic between them.\nThe setlist was very well chosen, mixing successful songs from previous albums, like Hysteria, Supermassive and Starlight; and new album hits like: Algorithm, Propaganda and Thought Contagion.\nThe songs were similar to other shows that they played on this tour in all Latin America, but they surprised Santiago with the song Bliss (not in other setlists).\nLead singer Matt sings very well live can make different tones of voice, is incredible, just like the albums!\nIn addition, the lighting games and dancers who were on the stage during the show further contributed to the whole presentation.\nThe show finished with Knights of Cydonia and made everyone very happy!\nA great night! Thank you Muse!\nThis was the 3rd concert I have seen Muse at. I have to say as far as concerts go, you won't find one with any more to it than a Muse concert. I have been to many concerts and I love them all. Music made in a studio is never going to capture the real live sound. Music is made to be played live!\nThe Simulation tour was simply amazing. Visually, audibly and just being there. Having trombones being played, actually played not recorded and being a part of the opening was simply astonishing. It as a great sound and visually it was amazing. The same with Pressure, having the trombones out there added to the song and made it unbelievable.\nThey also played Dig Down the acoustic gospel version live. With Dom, Matt and Chris playing center of the stadium. Chris on the acoustic guitar, Matt on the piano and Dom obviously on the drums. What a neat set to see them playing so close together and the gospel signers on stage lit up by their costumes. Very well done!\nOur son didn't(teenager) didn't understand the Close Encounters of the 3rd kind part. Where Matt was playing the guitar and the mother ship was responding. He is too young. :-) My wife and I got it.\nWatching Matt play his guitar by his tong! What? I had never seen anything like it. He is amazing. Chris is just amazing on bass and Dom on drums. These guys can do it all!\nWhat a fun show. I really appreciate what Muse has done to give back to their fan's. Too many bands don't care as long as they sell their tickets. Muse doesn't appear to be like that. Even purchasing tickets, they allow the true fans to purchase first getting the best seats.\nI look forward to seeing them again! Great show, great music, and a great time. Playing for almost 2 hours. Great job Muse!\nThere is a reason these guys play in big arenas. It’s not just a few guys on a stage playing their music, it’s a production. Even up in the nosebleeds it was a great show.\nSpoiler alert! Don’t read any further if you don’t want to know.\nHad it all! Glowing glasses, lit up suits, giant robots, a piano that shoots lasers, dancers with flashlights, smoke machines and glowing batons, and a special appearance by Eddie! People hanging from wires, surprises coming up from trap doors, lasers, lasers and more lasers! The set was a blistering 26 songs lasting a little over two hours!\nI will definitely see them again the next time they come to town. Though not from the balcony. They say “Don’t look down if you have a thing about heights.” That’s where the stage is!\nGreat show.", "select_response": "<think>\nThe purpose of the search round is to find recent announcements regarding Muse's 2024 tour dates, festival circuit plans, and detailed information about specific events like the Soundstorm Festival.

Four gigs were announced in total, all in the UK and all outdoor stadium gigs. As expected, more tour dates were announced throughout the following months, leading up to the tour itself. Bellamy mentioned, in an interview with Zane Lowe in August of 2022, that the tour would take place between January and July of 2023, starting in Mexico, continuing in the U.S. and Canada, and finishing in Europe.[1]\nMexico\nMexican dates were announced on October 7th, 2022. The tour included stops at Monterrey's Estadio Banorte, Guadalajara's Arena VFG and Mexico City's Foro Sol, spreading over two dates, on both 22nd and 23rd of January. The additional date in Mexico City, on 23rd, was announced on October 27th, 2022.\nThe short Mexican leg took place before the U.S. legs.\nUnited States & Canada\nTaking place after the short Mexican leg, U.S. and Canada legs exclusively featured indoor shows, with the only exception being the gig at Shaky Knees festival in Atlanta. Most tour dates were announced on September 29th, 2022. Two additional gigs in Montreal and Quebec were announced on October 6th, while additional gigs in St. Louis and Oakland were announced on October 17th.\nThe tour featured two legs and one \"lone\" show. The first leg began at Chicago's United Center on February 25th, and ended at Philadelphia's Wells Fargo Center on March 19th. The second leg started with the show at Phoenix's Desert Diamond Arena on April 2nd, ending with a gig at Salt Lake City's Vivint Smart Home Arena. The final show in the U.S. took place on May 6th, at the afforementioned Shaky Knees festival.\nEurope\nStadium gigs\nAs mentioned above, the first gigs of the tour that were announced were the UK gigs. These took place in Plymouth's Home Park on May 27th, Huddersfield's John Smith's Stadium on June 20th, Glasgow's Bellahouston Park on June 23rd and Milton Keynes's National Bowl on June 25th. The rest of the tour was announced afterwards. Additional European dates have been announced on January 20th, 2023, including the first show of the tour in Spain, in Santander's El Sardinero on July 4th, and a gig at Nancy's Zénith amphitheatre on July 6th, where they be played a headlining show, as part of the Nancy Open Air festival.\nThe rest of the European dates were announced soon afterwards. The European features Muse's first shows in the cities of Wiener Neustadt, Austria and Santander, Spain. Additionally, the show at Milton Keynes's National Bowl was Muse's first live show at the site. The last time Muse were at Milton Keynes before, was during the rehearsals for The Resistance stadium tour, in 2010. Additionally, Muse played in the city of The Hague, Netherlands after almost 23 years, and Lyon, France after about a decade.\nThe European tour featured an indoor production, scaled for an outdoor gig, and included both stadium and festival shows.\nArena gigs\nOn June 26th, the band announced indoor arena gigs for the UK and Ireland in autumn, with Nova Twins supporting.[2] The gigs announced are set to take place in Dublin's 3Arena on September 27th, Manchester's AO Arena on September 29th and London's The O2 on October 1st and 2nd.\nTravel packages\nThree travel packages were available to buy for three dates off of the European leg of the tour; Cologne (June 9th), Paris (July 8th) and Milan (July 22nd). Each travel package included, together with two tickets, a two-night stay at a hotel (king or twin bed rooms options are available). Hotels which were included are Cologne's Pullman, Paris's Marriott Ambassador and Milan's Marriott. An optional third night add-on was also included in each package, for additional cost. Additionally, two exclusive posters, commemorating Muse's performance at each venue in the city (RheinEnergieStadion in Cologne, Stade de France in Paris and San Siro in Milan) were included in each travel package, as were on-site hosts, and, for the Cologne gig, a roundtrip fare on the metro to the stadium.\nMore on the travel packages can be seen here.\nAsia\nAfter being teased on February 16th by the band on social media, the band announced the only Asian gig of the tour in Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia, on February 22nd. The open-air gig took place at the Bukit Jalil National Stadium on 29th July 2023.[3][4] The show marked the first Muse gig that took place in the country since 2007.\nSaudi Arabia\nIn 2024, Muse took time off touring to focus on families and solo projects. Despite that, two gigs took place in Saudi Arabia in December; The first one in Abu Dhabi, at F1, and another one, in Riyadh, at the Banban Festival.\nSupporting acts\nThje first support act to be announced were Royal Blood, who opened for Muse during the European open-air leg (exceptions being the Nancy and Glasgow gigs, aswell as festivals). For the U.S. shows, Evanescence were announced as the main opening act. Additional support acts for U.S. shows were announced on November 9th, 2022; One Ok Rock supported Muse during the first half of the U.S. leg (between Chicago and Philadelphia gigs), while Highly Suspect will be supporting Muse during the second half of the U.S. leg (between the Phoenix and Salt Lake City gigs).[5] On January 13th, 2023, The Warning were announced as the support act for the Mexico gigs.[6]\nOn March 22nd, both The Warning and One Ok Rock were announced as additional support acts for select European dates. The Warning supported Muse on the U.K. leg (plus one stop in Lyon, France), while One Ok Rock supported them on the rest of the European leg (excluding festivals, and the Glasgow gig). Joining the two is Twin Atlantic, who opened together with The Warning on the afforementioned Bellahouston Park gig in Glasgow.[7] A support change was made for the gig in Bern, Switzerland, as One Ok Rock couldn't perform at due to unforeseen circumstances; Replacing them was Emilie Zoé. Kyoto Protocol were announced as the support act for the Kuala Lumpur gig only a few weeks before the show itself, on July 11th, 2023.\nOn June 26th, alongside the annoucement of the UK and Ireland indoor gigs, Nova Twins were announced to be supporting Muse on these gigs.[8]\nProduction\nAs with the previous large headlining tour, the Simulation Theory World Tour, this tour features indoor, outdoor and festival shows. The stage set-up in general is a hybrid between the 2022 festivals tour and the autumn theatre tour setups. It includes an inflatable rotating figure of Will the Hacker as a backdrop, together with a grid of light fixtures, similar to the one from the theatre tour. Joining Will the Hacker is a new figure nicknamed \"Baph\".\nThe festival setup (which was also used during the Mexican leg of the tour) bears more resemblance to the 2022 summer festivals setup, with the only major difference being an addition of the lighting grid, replacing the LED strip lights behind the band. An inflatable figure of Will is present throughout the entire show, including the encore, while the setlists themselves (exceptions being the Mexican shows) include no rotations, and are more akin to the 2022 summer festivals setlists\nThe indoor setup, which premiered at the North American leg, features a stage with transparent floor, allowing for it to be illuminated from below, with an addition of a larger B-stage, six moving glass panels with lights, hung above the band, more lights on the back-grid, and, as mentioned above, an inflatable figure named \"Baph\", joining \"Will\", getting inflated for the encore. Because of the differences, the setlists for the North American shows also got \"revamped\".\nThe stage for the European outdoor setup had the same core of elements as the indoor arena setup , with an addition of two stage wings on either side, aswell as larger LED screens on both sides of the stage, equipped with light fixtures. It also featured a longer runway to the B-stage, with the B-stage itself being slightly bigger than it was for the indoor shows. \"Will\" is now equipped with a LED screen inside of his mask, an exclusive to the stadium/headlining shows, as festivals still use the older and smaller version of the figure. The full outdoor set up was officially revealed on Muse's Instagram[9], a day prior to the first gig in Plymouth, on May 26th, after pictures and videos of the stage being set up surfaced on social media a few days before.[10]\nFor the Saudi Arabia gigs in 2024, the core of the production remained the same, however, the burning WOTP logo was ditched.\nShort tour documentaries\nA series of short documentaries was set to be released throughout the tour itself, shot and edited by Muse's WOTP tour photographer Johann Ramos (known as \"The Work of Jar\") and Centreline Films, posted on Muse's YouTube channel.\nSix documentaries have been released so far. The first one is a recap of the first leg of the tour in Mexico, the second one goes over the rehearsals, which took place in California's Ontario, aswell as the Chicago show. The third one looks back at week one of the U.S. leg of the tour, the fourth one talks about the homecoming Plymouth show, and week one of the European leg, can be seen here. The fifht one shows various clips and highlights from the European stadium tour. The sixth features Matt talking about Kill or Be Killed, while showing pre-show backstage footage.\nAverage Setlist\nDuring the January leg in Mexico, the setlist remained relatively unchaged from the shows off of the 2022 festivals tour. This changed with leg 1 in the U.S., starting in Chicago, in February, when the show was updated, in turn bringing in a new setlist format. This first indoor leg in the U.S. brought in live premieres of Verona and The Dark Side (Alternate Reality Version) (Instrumental). STT Interstitials 1 and 3 returned as Simulation Theory Theme, which was played from tape, mashed up with [JFK], acting as an intro to Kill or Be Killed. Additionally, Kill or Be Killed's Felsmann + Tiley Reinterpretation version was played from tape, as an interstitial, before Compliance. Also returning after several years were Resistance, Undisclosed Desires and the shortened version of Isolated System. Assassin (Grand Omega Bosses) was also played, making this the second big headlining tour to feature Assassin, played in full since the Black Holes And Revelations Tour, with it previously being only played during The Drones World Tour 2015/16.\nWith the announcement of the Absolution XX Anniversary boxset in September of 2023, the band looks to have put an emphasis on songs off of the album during the indoor autumn leg in the UK and Ireland, with both Butterflies & Hurricanes and Apocalypse Please played on the first night of the leg in Dublin. Both songs were played for the first time in 6 years and 7 years respectively. During the leg, Stockholm Syndrome replaced Kill or Be Killed in its slot in Manchester. Space Dementia also made a return.\nThe setlist changed the most with the 2024 Saudi Arabia gigs, with the usual opener (Will ofthe People) replaced with the Simulation Theory Theme / JFK mashup (played from tape) and Won't Stand Down. Starlight was also chosen to replace Knights of Cydonia as a closer for the first time in 11 years. Bellamy's own piece Hanging in Victory Square (from the Nineteen Eighty-Four audiobook soundtrack) was also played live for the first time before Time Is Running Out.\nMexican shows set\n- Will of the People (extended intro)\n- Interlude + Hysteria\n- [Drill Sergeant] (robot voice) + Psycho\n- Pressure / Map of the Problematique / Bliss\n- Won't Stand Down\n- Stockholm Syndrome / Citizen Erased / New Born\n- The Gallery\n- Compliance\n- Thought Contagion\n- Time Is Running Out\n- You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween\n- Madness\n- We Are Fucking Fucked\n- Supermassive Black Hole\n- Plug In Baby (extended outro)\n- Behold, The Glove (Matthew Bellamy song)\n- Uprising (extended outro)\n- Prelude + Starlight\nEncore\nU.S./Canada/Ireland/UK indoor shows set\n- Will of the People (extended intro)\n- Interlude + Hysteria\n- [Drill Sergeant] (robot voice) + Psycho\n- Bliss (extended outro) / Map of the Problematique / Citizen Erased / New Born / Stockholm Syndrome / Pressure / Assassin (Grand Omega Bosses version) / Butterflies & Hurricanes (UK + Ireland only)\n- Won't Stand Down\n- Kill or Be Killed (Felsmann + Tiley Reinterpretation) (played from tape)\n- Compliance\n- Thought Contagion\n- Verona / Liberation (Canada only) / Apocalypse Please (UK + Ireland only) / Space Dementia (UK only)\n- Time Is Running Out\n- Isolated System (shortened)\n- Resistance / Undisclosed Desires\n- Toccata and Fugue in D Minor intro + You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween\n- Madness\n- We Are Fucking Fucked\n- The Dark Side (Alternate Reality Version) (instrumental)\n- Supermassive Black Hole\n- Plug In Baby (extended outro)\n- Behold, The Glove (Matthew Bellamy song)\n- Uprising (extended outro)\n- Prelude + Starlight\nEncore\n- Simulation Theory Theme (Matthew Bellamy song) (shortened) with JFK\n- Kill or Be Killed / Stockholm Syndrome (Manchester only)\n- Man With a Harmonica + Knights of Cydonia\nEU/stadium shows set\n- Will of the People (extended intro)\n- Interlude + Hysteria\n- [Drill Sergeant] (robot voice) + Psycho\n- Bliss (extended outro) / Map of the Problematique / Stockholm Syndrome\n- Resistance\n- Won't Stand Down\n- Kill or Be Killed (Felsmann + Tiley Reinterpretation) (played from tape)\n- Compliance\n- Thought Contagion\n- Verona\n- Time Is Running Out\n- Isolated System (shortened)\n- Undisclosed Desires\n- Toccata and Fugue in D Minor intro + You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween\n- Madness\n- We Are Fucking Fucked\n- The Dark Side (Alternate Reality Version) (instrumental)\n- Supermassive Black Hole\n- Plug In Baby (extended outro)\n- Behold, The Glove (Matthew Bellamy song)\n- Uprising (extended outro)\n- Prelude + Starlight\nEncore\n- Simulation Theory Theme (Matthew Bellamy song) (shortened) with JFK\n- Kill or Be Killed\n- Man With a Harmonica + Knights of Cydonia\nEU/US festival shows set\n- Will of the People (extended intro)\n- Interlude + Hysteria\n- [Drill Sergeant] (robot voice) + Psycho\n- Thought Contagion\n- Won't Stand Down\n- Kill or Be Killed (Felsmann + Tiley Reinterpretation) (played from tape)\n- Compliance\n- Time Is Running Out\n- Toccata and Fugue in D Minor intro + You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween\n- Madness\n- We Are Fucking Fucked\n- Isolated System (shortened)\n- Supermassive Black Hole\n- Plug In Baby (extended outro)\n- Behold, The Glove (Matthew Bellamy song)\n- Uprising (extended outro)\n- Prelude + Starlight\nEncore\nSaudi Arabia shows set\n- Simulation Theory Theme (Matthew Bellamy song) (shortened) with JFK\n- Interlude + Hysteria\n- Won't Stand Down\n- Resistance\n- [Drill Sergeant] (robot voice) + Psycho\n- Kill or Be Killed (Felsmann + Tiley Reinterpretation) (played from tape)\n- Compliance\n- Madness\n- Thought Contagion\n- Pressure (Abu Dhabi only)\n- Plug In Baby (extended outro)\n- Hanging in Victory Square (Matthew Bellamy song)\n- Time Is Running Out\n- Will of the People (extended intro)\n- Supermassive Black Hole\n- Toccata and Fugue in D Minor intro + You Make Me Feel Like It's Halloween (Abu Dhabi only)\n- Uprising (extended outro)\n- Man With a Harmonica + Knights of Cydonia\nEncore\n- Isolated System (shortened) (Abu Dhabi only)\n- Undisclosed Desires (Abu Dhabi only)\n- Prelude + Starlight\nNotes & Exceptions\n- During the four Mexican shows, rotation slots got swapped around the setlists. Generally, the setlists for these shows were more or less the same to these of the Will of the People Festivals Tour.\n- With the start of the U.S. tour, the production was updated, in turn also changing the setlists - Scrambling songs on the setlist and changing its template, replacing The Gallery with Kill or Be Killed (Felsmann + Tiley Remix) and adding songs like Verona, The Dark Side (Alternate Reality Instrumental) and Isolated System to the sets.\n- A few gigs into the U.S. leg, Undisclosed Desires was put into rotation with Resistance.\n- Liberation was in rotation with Verona on double nights during the NA leg of the tour, which were only the second night of both Quebec City and Montreal. Verona was dropped for the UK indoor leg with Apocalypse Please and Space Dementia played in rotation in its place.\n- The Shaky Knees Festival gig featured a shorter setlist with a few changes compared to the indoor gig setlists; Thought Contagion was played earlier in the set, Isolated System was played before Supermassive Black Hole and The Dark Side (Alternate Reality)'s instrumental version and JFK / Simulation Theory Theme intro were ditched from the set. The same setlist was played at the NorthSide festival in Denmark.\n- For the stadium shows, Resistance and Undisclosed Desires were brought out of rotation and were both played at each show.\n- The stadium shows also featured less songs in the first rotation slot, these being Bliss and Map of the Problematique (with the latter only being played three times so far). Stockholm Syndrome joined the two at the Rome gig.\n- Showbiz was played instead of Knights of Cydonia at the Werchter Festival gig after technical issues meant the latter song couldn't be played. This made it the first gig in which all 9 studio albums were represented.\nStats\nGigs\n| Date | Venue | Location |\n|---|---|---|\n| 2024-12-13 | Banban (Soundstorm Festival) | Riyadh, Saudi Arabia |\n| 2024-12-08 | Du Arena (Formula 1 Grand Prix) | Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates |\n| 2023-11-04 | Foro Pegaso (Hell & Heaven Festival) | Toluca de Lerdo, Mexico |\n| 2023-10-02 | The O2 Arena | London, UK |\n| 2023-10-01 | The O2 Arena | London, UK |\n| 2023-09-29 | AO Arena | Manchester, UK |\n| 2023-09-27 | 3Arena | Dublin, Ireland |\n| 2023-07-29 | Bukit Kiara Equestrian Resort | Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia |\n| 2023-07-22 | Stadio Giuseppe Meazza | Milan, Italy |\n| 2023-07-18 | Stadio Olimpico | Rome, Italy |\n| 2023-07-15 | Stade Orange Vélodrome | Marseille, France |\n| 2023-07-12 | BernExpo Areal | Bern, Switzerland |\n| 2023-07-08 | Stade de France | Paris, France |\n| 2023-07-06 | Zénith de Nancy (Nancy Open Air) | Nancy, France |\n| 2023-07-04 | Campos de Sport de El Sardinero | Santander, Spain |\n| 2023-07-01 | Festivalpark Werchter (Rock Werchter) | Werchter, Belgium |\n| 2023-06-29 | Matmut Atlantique | Bordeaux, France |\n| 2023-06-25 | The National Bowl | Milton Keynes, UK |\n| 2023-06-23 | Bellahouston Park | Glasgow, UK |\n| 2023-06-20 | John Smith's Stadium | Huddersfield, UK |\n| 2023-06-18 | Flugplatz Neuhausen (Southside Festival) | Neuhausen ob Eck, Germany |\n| 2023-06-17 | Eichenring (Hurricane Festival) | Scheessel, Germany |\n| 2023-06-15 | Groupama Stadium | Lyon, France |\n| 2023-06-11 | Park 360 (Rock for People) | Hradec Králové, Czech Republic |\n| 2023-06-09 | RheinEnergieStadion | Cologne, Germany |\n| 2023-06-07 | Malieveld | The Hague, Netherlands |\n| 2023-06-03 | Stadion Wiener Neustadt | Wiener Neustadt, Austria |\n| 2023-06-01 | Eskelunden (NorthSide) | Århus, Denmark |\n| 2023-05-27 | Home Park | Plymouth, UK |\n| 2023-05-06 | Central Park (Shaky Knees Music Festival) | Atlanta, GA, USA |\n| 2023-04-20 | Vivint Arena | Salt Lake City, UT, USA |\n| 2023-04-18 | Climate Pledge Arena | Seattle, WA, USA |\n| 2023-04-16 | Moda Center | Portland, OR, USA |\n| 2023-04-14 | Oakland Arena | Oakland, CA, USA |\n| 2023-04-12 | Honda Center | Anaheim, CA, USA |\n| 2023-04-10 | Pechanga Arena | San Diego, CA, USA |\n| 2023-04-08 | T-Mobile Arena | Las Vegas, NV, USA |\n| 2023-04-06 | Crypto.com Arena | Los Angeles, CA, USA |\n| 2023-04-04 | Ball Arena | Denver, CO, USA |\n| 2023-04-02 | Desert Diamond Arena | Phoenix, AZ, USA |\n| 2023-03-19 | Wells Fargo Center | Philadelphia, PA, USA |\n| 2023-03-17 | Madison Square Garden | New York City, NY, USA |\n| 2023-03-15 | Centre Bell | Montreal, QC, Canada |\n| 2023-03-14 | Centre Bell | Montreal, QC, Canada |\n| 2023-03-12 | Centre Vidéotron | Québec City, QC, Canada |\n| 2023-03-11 | Centre Vidéotron | Québec City, QC, Canada |\n| 2023-03-09 | Scotiabank Arena | Toronto, ON, Canada |\n| 2023-03-07 | Nationwide Arena | Columbus, OH, USA |\n| 2023-03-05 | Chaifetz Arena | St. Louis, MO, USA |\n| 2023-03-03 | Dickies Arena | Fort Worth, TX, USA |\n| 2023-03-02 | Toyota Center | Houston, TX, USA |\n| 2023-02-28 | Moody Center | Austin, TX, USA |\n| 2023-02-26 | Target Center | Minneapolis, MN, USA |\n| 2023-02-25 | United Center | Chicago, IL, USA |\n| 2023-01-23 | Foro Sol | Mexico City, Mexico |\n| 2023-01-22 | Foro Sol | Mexico City, Mexico |\n| 2023-01-20 | Arena V.F.G. | Guadalajara, Mexico |\n| 2023-01-18 | Estadio Banorte | Monterrey, Mexico |\nSee also\nReferences\n- ↑ https://youtu.be/AMvtyphl9rA?t=2297\n- ↑ https://www.muse.mu/news/new-uk-ireland-arena-dates-323411/\n- ↑ https://www.instagram.com/p/CpMk5jDBxEG/\n- ↑ https://twitter.com/muse/status/1628321276896112641\n- ↑ https://twitter.com/muse/status/1590403848077803520/photo/1\n- ↑ https://www.instagram.com/p/CnXcXiNNSFy/\n- ↑ https://twitter.com/muse/status/1638587091020914713/photo/1\n- ↑ https://www.muse.mu/news/new-uk-ireland-arena-dates-323411/\n- ↑ https://www.instagram.com/p/Csuf6rlqKCS/\n- ↑ https://www.instagram.com/p/CsZn26TSifb/", "select_response": "<think>\nThe webpage primarily focuses on the \"Will of the People World Tour\" by Muse, detailing past performances from the tour, including specific dates and venues.

After playing gigs around London and Manchester, Muse released their debut album, Showbiz, in 1999. Over the next few years, the group experimented with instruments such as the church organ, animal bones and an expanded drum kit, giving their next album a classical yet romantic influence. In 2001, the group released their sophomore album, Origins of Symmetry, which showcased their newly developed melancholic sound. Muse had their big break after releasing their third album, Absolution, which debuted at No. 1 in the UK and produced their first top ten hit, ‘Time is Running Out. ’ Following this success, they released their third album, Black Holes and Revelations, which incorporated electronic and pop elements. Muse is known for their lyrical albums, all of which are inspired by introspective themes, books and global issues. Each album represents a different concept, such as relationships, science fiction and drone warfare. Muses’ ability to create a cohesive sound while blending many different styles is nothing short of impressive, making it no surprise that they have won multiple Grammys and sold millions of albums worldwide.\nHow much are Muse tickets?\nThere are no upcoming events for Muse.

Once indoors at Mandalay Bay, once outdoor at Aftershock in Sacramento. This was, BY FAR, the best show I've seen them do. Out of the hundreds of shows I've been to in my life, this was in the top 5.

The band consists of Matt Bellamy (lead vocals, guitar, piano, keyboards), Chris Wolstenholme (bass guitar, backing vocals, keyboards) and Dominic Howard (drums, percussion).\nMuse released their debut album, Showbiz, in 1999, showcasing Bellamy's falsetto and a melancholic alternative rock style. Their second album, Origin of Symmetry (2001), expanded their sound, incorporating wider instrumentation and romantic classical influences, and earned them a reputation for energetic live performances. Absolution (2003) saw further classical influence, with orchestra on tracks such as \"Butterflies and Hurricanes\", and became the first of five consecutive UK number-one albums.\nBlack Holes and Revelations (2006) incorporated electronic and pop elements, influenced by 1980s groups such as Depeche Mode, displayed in singles such as \"Supermassive Black Hole\". The album brought Muse wider international success. The Resistance (2009) and The 2nd Law (2012) explored themes of government oppression and civil uprising and cemented Muse as one of the world's major stadium acts. Their seventh album, Drones (2015), was a concept album about drone warfare and returned to a harder rock sound.\nMuse have won numerous awards, including two Grammy Awards, winning the Grammys for Best Rock Album for The Resistance and Drones, two Brit Awards, winning Best British Live Act twice, five MTV Europe Music Awards and eight NME Awards. They have sold over 20 million albums worldwide.", "select_response": "<think>\nThe purpose of this search round is to gather very recent announcements about Muse's upcoming performances, specifically focusing on spring/summer 2024 tour dates, complete festival circuit plans, and detailed information about the Soundstorm Festival 2024 performance.

The show was short but a very good one! The singer, Ricky Wilson, is very charismatic and an excellent dancer!\nAbout Muse - Tour Simulation Theory:\nthe sound was very good, the instruments were heard in good frequency and also the voices.\nThe band has a strong connection on stage and a great dynamic between them.\nThe setlist was very well chosen, mixing successful songs from previous albums, like Hysteria, Supermassive and Starlight; and new album hits like: Algorithm, Propaganda and Thought Contagion.\nThe songs were similar to other shows that they played on this tour in all Latin America, but they surprised Santiago with the song Bliss (not in other setlists).\nLead singer Matt sings very well live can make different tones of voice, is incredible, just like the albums!\nIn addition, the lighting games and dancers who were on the stage during the show further contributed to the whole presentation.\nThe show finished with Knights of Cydonia and made everyone very happy!\nA great night! Thank you Muse!\nThis was the 3rd concert I have seen Muse at. I have to say as far as concerts go, you won't find one with any more to it than a Muse concert. I have been to many concerts and I love them all. Music made in a studio is never going to capture the real live sound. Music is made to be played live!\nThe Simulation tour was simply amazing. Visually, audibly and just being there. Having trombones being played, actually played not recorded and being a part of the opening was simply astonishing. It as a great sound and visually it was amazing. The same with Pressure, having the trombones out there added to the song and made it unbelievable.\nThey also played Dig Down the acoustic gospel version live. With Dom, Matt and Chris playing center of the stadium. Chris on the acoustic guitar, Matt on the piano and Dom obviously on the drums. What a neat set to see them playing so close together and the gospel signers on stage lit up by their costumes. Very well done!\nOur son didn't(teenager) didn't understand the Close Encounters of the 3rd kind part. Where Matt was playing the guitar and the mother ship was responding. He is too young. :-) My wife and I got it.\nWatching Matt play his guitar by his tong! What? I had never seen anything like it. He is amazing. Chris is just amazing on bass and Dom on drums. These guys can do it all!\nWhat a fun show. I really appreciate what Muse has done to give back to their fan's. Too many bands don't care as long as they sell their tickets. Muse doesn't appear to be like that. Even purchasing tickets, they allow the true fans to purchase first getting the best seats.\nI look forward to seeing them again! Great show, great music, and a great time. Playing for almost 2 hours. Great job Muse!\nThere is a reason these guys play in big arenas. It’s not just a few guys on a stage playing their music, it’s a production. Even up in the nosebleeds it was a great show.\nSpoiler alert! Don’t read any further if you don’t want to know.\nHad it all! Glowing glasses, lit up suits, giant robots, a piano that shoots lasers, dancers with flashlights, smoke machines and glowing batons, and a special appearance by Eddie! People hanging from wires, surprises coming up from trap doors, lasers, lasers and more lasers! The set was a blistering 26 songs lasting a little over two hours!\nI will definitely see them again the next time they come to town. Though not from the balcony. They say “Don’t look down if you have a thing about heights.” That’s where the stage is!\nGreat show.", "select_response": "<think>\nThe purpose of this search round is to gather recent information about a music artist, including new singles, music videos, collaborations, interviews, future projects, and tours for the years 2024-2025.

Muse is known for a unique style of alt-rock, with electronic music leanings and a blend of classical music, which lends to an ethereal, melancholic sound.\nStarting in the early ’90s under the original name Gothic Plague, the band toured relentlessly with bands such as Skunk Anansie. The band released its first EPs to a loyal fan base and was met with relative success in the UK indie charts. This earned the group crucial backing from the likes of Steve Lamacq and NME, and its debut studio album Showbiz was released in 1999, scoring relative chart success. The album has since gone on to become a certified platinum album in the UK.\nMuse’s second album, released in 2001, revealed a growth in sound and ambition that is still evident in its records today. Origin of Symmetry saw the band shift into progressive rock territory, producing momentous singles like “New Born” and “Bliss.” The album acted as a catalyst that moved Muse into commercial and critical success for years to come. Its next four albums all topped the UK album charts, and the band has sold over 15 million albums worldwide.\nIn 2003, Muse released its third album, Absolution. This album debuted at number one in the UK, and with time, became certified gold in the US. This album is widely considered the band’s breakthrough album, with key hits such as “Time Is Running Out” and “Hysteria” topping the charts. In support of this album, Muse headed out on a year-long international tour.\nIn 2006, Muse released its fourth studio album, Black Holes and Revelations. This album debuted at number one on the charts in five countries. From this album, two singles, \"Supermassive Black Hole\" and \"Knights of Cydonia,\" became chart-toppers, reaching the top 10 hits in the UK.\nMuse’s live shows also followed the same ambitious, gargantuan elevation of music. Famed for its tours, the band has won two Brit Awards for Best Live Act, and it sells out arenas and stadiums around the globe with ease. Muse has become a legendary force on the festival circuit, and has headlined Reading and Leeds, T in the Park, and Glastonbury over the years. At Glastonbury Festival 2010, a gigantic crowd to its pyramid stage set up at the latter event in 2010.\nAround the same time, Muse’s latest album The Resistance was conquering all corners of the UK. The band then scooped three Grammy nominations and a win for Best Rock Album, which helped it officially break into the US. Its explosion in popularity led to its performance at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London – and to its single “Survival” becoming the official anthem of the event.\nSince its acclaimed Olympic performance, Muse has gone on to produce three more albums. Released in 2015, Drones was an album that aimed to return to the original rock sound for which Muse was originally known, but weaved in a powerful statement on the dehumanization of modern warfare. with the release of Drones, Muse began another tour focused on small venues throughout the UK and theAlong US. Drones an immediate hit, topping charts globally.\nAfter touring the globe, including headlining at major festivals, Muse continued its path forward with another album release in 2018 — Simulation Theory. This kicked off the Simulation Theory World Tour, which took the band all the way from Houston, Texas, to a final stop in Lima, Peru.\nAt the end of 2019, Muse released a special compilation box titled Origin of Muse. This included remastered versions of its albums and previously unreleased music. This special edition is a dream come true for Muse fans. The box contains a 48-page book, nine CDs, four vinyl records. One of the highlights of the set is a fully-remastered version of the band’s debut album Showbiz.\nMost recently, in 2022, Muse released the Will of the People. This album showcases the darker, heavier side of Muse’s music, with singles “Won’t Stand Down” and “Compliance” quickly becoming fan favorites.\nKnown for its flawless performances, Muse continues to capture the depth of its musical history in every show. Fans, who are often referred to as Musers, flock to see the band perform at large arenas around the world. Most shows sell out, and in order to find a position near the front of the stage, Musers arrive hours ahead of showtime.\nNot only does Muse deliver an incredibly dynamic and energetic live show, but its sound production is renowned for being top-quality. Bellamy’s vocals can be heard clearly, along with every accompanying instrument. Recently, touring member Morgan Nicholls was replaced by Dan Lancaster. Lancaster now plays additional keys, percussion, and guitar, as well as providing backup vocals.\nTo snag tickets to a Muse tour date, make sure to pay attention to recently released tour schedules. Muse’s 2022-2023 “The Will of the People World” Tour reaches far and wide.\nRead moreEnjoyed the band but not the show. The organizers failed in everything they could fail. Believe me, I've been to a lot of international shows here in Argentina and Chile, and this was the first time ever that I couldn't hear the music some times.\nThe \"Complejo al Río\" is in a great zone of Vicente López, really near to buses, subway, and two of the most important avenues (Av. Santa Fe/Cabildo/Maipú and Av. Libertador); so I got there without any troubles and even had some food because there were a lot of places to eat or drink near it.\nIt all went down when the showtime was getting near: I got in without getting checked, as most people, really dangerous; then, the entrance was full of construction debris (dangerous x2). Once I was in, I realized that the venue was pretty much a cement parking lot with a couple of bleachers, wouldn't be much of a problem if it weren't that: a) there were holes in the floor, so somebody could have get hurt while jumping and; b) it was on downhill, so that meant that in certain areas of the \"campo trasero\" you couldn't see anything.\nWhen it started, everyone was excited, jumping, but two songs in we realised that we couldn't hear sometimes: the sound came and then go away. You could literally heard people talking over the music! And this wasn't an acoustic show! The low-volume stayed the whole gig, and it ruined songs like Madness that I could literally not hear. Bonus track: Matt confused Argentina with Uruguay and used their flag here. Everyone shouting \"NOOO\" which meant hearing even less.\nGoing strictly to the show: the band pulled out a pretty good one, they didn't interacted with the public a lot but considering videos I've seen, that's just how they are. The setlist was the very same of two days ago in Chile, so there's nothing to complain about though we Argentinians are used to the fact that the bands always play more songs here, or change the setlist a bit. Muse was not the case.\nI still had a great time and would totally go to see this band again, specially because I feel like I didn't got the full experience. It's too much to know that they never come with the full stages and theatrics to add the fact that they came without speakers.\nThis was the 3rd concert I have seen Muse at. I have to say as far as concerts go, you won't find one with any more to it than a Muse concert. I have been to many concerts and I love them all. Music made in a studio is never going to capture the real live sound. Music is made to be played live!\nThe Simulation tour was simply amazing. Visually, audibly and just being there. Having trombones being played, actually played not recorded and being a part of the opening was simply astonishing. It as a great sound and visually it was amazing. The same with Pressure, having the trombones out there added to the song and made it unbelievable.\nThey also played Dig Down the acoustic gospel version live. With Dom, Matt and Chris playing center of the stadium. Chris on the acoustic guitar, Matt on the piano and Dom obviously on the drums. What a neat set to see them playing so close together and the gospel signers on stage lit up by their costumes. Very well done!\nOur son didn't(teenager) didn't understand the Close Encounters of the 3rd kind part. Where Matt was playing the guitar and the mother ship was responding. He is too young. :-) My wife and I got it.\nWatching Matt play his guitar by his tong! What? I had never seen anything like it. He is amazing. Chris is just amazing on bass and Dom on drums. These guys can do it all!\nWhat a fun show. I really appreciate what Muse has done to give back to their fan's. Too many bands don't care as long as they sell their tickets. Muse doesn't appear to be like that. Even purchasing tickets, they allow the true fans to purchase first getting the best seats.\nI look forward to seeing them again! Great show, great music, and a great time. Playing for almost 2 hours. Great job Muse!\nOver the course of two decades, Muse’s live show has evolved into one of the most sensational spectacles in the world - an experience worthy of four (!) live DVDs churned out since the release of Hullabaloo in 2001.\nFrom humble beginnings touring the UK dive bar circuit, the band’s intellectual prog-rock quickly earned them the heavy burden of ‘the next Radiohead’: a stigma brushed aside, and a prophecy fulfilled.\nThe band’s trajectory to international stardom was driven in the early noughties by huge success around ‘Origin Of Symmetry’ and ‘Absolution’; a pair of records that delivered sold out arena shows across the globe.\nFrom that point on, Muse poured everything into their live show. From huge satellite dishes beaming light into the sky to monumental, rotating pillars, each tour delivers something totally unexpected, and utterly jawdropping. And that’s prior to any mention of the crazy, crazy talent exhibited on stage. Matt Bellamy, one of the few true rockstars of the modern age, thrashes and strokes at his guitar in equal measure, and delivers stunning falsetto vocals. Though the band have recruited extra, ‘behind-the-scenes’ members over recent years, the amount of noise produced by the three piece remains astounding.\nWith Glastonbury and Coachella headline slots - and just about everything other accolade - under their belts, where now for Muse? Somehow, the only way, still, is up. And it’s guaranteed to be totally bombastic.\nSince their incarnation in 1994, the Devon trio has evolved from a garage rock band into a momentous live act that has conquered the largest stages and festivals all around the planet with their space-themed apoco-pop rock. The band has six albums in its discography, which was not seem like very much for an artist that has reached a reputation as saintly as Muse, yet it is what Matt Bellamy and co transform their music into onstage which continues to wow audiences.\nAs the bass rumbles and begins 'Supremacy', the band appear all at once surrounded by fire and pyrotechnics as they wage some solar war all within their own minds. As they run through their hits such as 'Supermassive Black Hole' and 'Starlight' at blistering speeds, the audience have no choice to watch on in blind amazement. Matt Bellamy is a frontman often likened to the late, great Freddie Mercury and after seeing him perform you realise there is serious weight behind these lofty claims.\nNo matter how big his crowd, Matt throws himself into every blistering guitar solo and whips crowds into frenzies like no other. When the finale of 'Knights Of Cydonia' kicks in, the audience has completely surrendered itself to the supernatural, surreal world of Muse and simply hope they will never return.\nSantiago de Chile - October 13th\nThe first good surprise was with the opening band, Kaiser Chiefs. The show was short but a very good one! The singer, Ricky Wilson, is very charismatic and an excellent dancer!\nAbout Muse - Tour Simulation Theory:\nthe sound was very good, the instruments were heard in good frequency and also the voices.\nThe band has a strong connection on stage and a great dynamic between them.\nThe setlist was very well chosen, mixing successful songs from previous albums, like Hysteria, Supermassive and Starlight; and new album hits like: Algorithm, Propaganda and Thought Contagion.\nThe songs were similar to other shows that they played on this tour in all Latin America, but they surprised Santiago with the song Bliss (not in other setlists).\nLead singer Matt sings very well live can make different tones of voice, is incredible, just like the albums!\nIn addition, the lighting games and dancers who were on the stage during the show further contributed to the whole presentation.\nThe show finished with Knights of Cydonia and made everyone very happy!\nA great night! Thank you Muse!\nI had seen Muse a few times at various festivals over the years (Reading twice, V Festival, Download) and wanted to see them in their own show and I thought what better place than to do that than at Londons O2 Arena.\nMuse played for 2 hours with a faultless performance. Belting out classics such as Plug In Baby, Stockholm Syndrome and completing the evening with the infectious Knights Of Cydonia as well as promoting songs from the current Drones album.\nMy only regret of the evening was having to be upstairs on Level 4 for this concert. People standing in the Floor areas and Level 1 seem to be able to let loose and enjoy themselves but upstairs really didn't know how to behave at a rock concert with he majority remaining seated and I was even asked to sit down by the person behind me. Unfortunately the big arenas can bring out the punters who aren't used to what a rock concert can be about but i'll balance this comment by saying that I should have been downstairs if I really wanted to rock out.\nGreat performance by band, disappointed with the crowd as a whole.\nWe came in from Houston to see Muse in Austin. I've had to miss their TX shows in the past because I didnt have the money or time, but this year I said fuck it, I'm going to this show and I wont miss them again. It was so worth it. They sounded amazing, the whole band are great performers. They posted the whole concert on facebook so I thought that was cool. I can watch it again if I want. So, so worth it. The stage was really cool with these stacks of video monitors in the back and they were staggered. It's hard to describe, but it looked really good. The only complaint I had was that I bought an actual seat but everyone stood the whole time, so it was kind of pointless, but I'm glad I had something to lean on if I got too tired. It was kind of hard to see the band on stage because people were in the way, but I'm sort of short so...oh well. It was a very minor complaint and nothing against Muse. If (I should say WHEN) I see them again, I'll try to get a seat on the rail with no one in front of me, but you know how it goes.\nAn impressive start with \"Psycho\" brought all the energy to the Olympia-halle without any warming up. The setlist was loaded with the tracks of their latest Best-Rock-Album-Grammy winner, \"Drones\", but also included some classics as \"Plug In Baby\", \"Stockholm Syndrome\", and an amazing performance of \"Citizen Erased\", a song from \"Origin of Symmetry\" rarely played in the latest years shows.\nThe stage in itself deserves recognition as it was meant to rotate, while holding a structure from where around ten drones came into the show flashing and wandering around some meters over the crowd. In addition, a series of interactive projections were prepared in accordance to every song lyrics.\nBellamy asked people to help on singing the already classic \"Time Is Running Out\", as well as \"Starlight\" and the whole chorus for \"Uprising\".\nA great show that clarifies why they are one of the best live bands at the moment.\nThere is a reason these guys play in big arenas. It’s not just a few guys on a stage playing their music, it’s a production. Even up in the nosebleeds it was a great show.\nSpoiler alert! Don’t read any further if you don’t want to know.\nHad it all! Glowing glasses, lit up suits, giant robots, a piano that shoots lasers, dancers with flashlights, smoke machines and glowing batons, and a special appearance by Eddie! People hanging from wires, surprises coming up from trap doors, lasers, lasers and more lasers! The set was a blistering 26 songs lasting a little over two hours!\nI will definitely see them again the next time they come to town. Though not from the balcony. They say “Don’t look down if you have a thing about heights.” That’s where the stage is!\nGreat show.\nSaw them in Milan 20/5. I've been attending concerts for more than 10 years now and this gig goes into my top 5!! The show, the energy, the sound (!!) was amazing! I was blown away by Matt's voice, so clear and beautiful, Chris's dexterity with the bass (for me the second best bass player ever) and Dominic's drum solos. I loved the round stage in the center of the arena, you can really see them well from wherever you are standing/seating. I really wish more bands could afford this kind of technology, oh well... And the video projections, especially the puppeteering part during The Handler... genious and scary! The setlist included almost all the songs I wanted to hear live (I only missed Stockholm Syndrome and Bliss). All in all, kudos to the guys, really, I hope too see them again very soon.\nWant to see Muse in concert?

Read More: Muse: “There’s gonna be a big …\nContent: Chris Wolstenholme has opened up about the future of Muse, and suggested that the band are already thinking about a new album.\nThe bassist opened up about potential new material from the band during a new interview on The Leona Graham Podcast, and suggested that fans can hope to see a new album being shared in 2026.\nDuring the interview, Wolstenholme was asked about the current status of the band – particularly with them not being signed to any label at the moment – and asked if this is something that would have to change before they could share any new music.\n“We will [sign to a label], obviously. I think we’re gonna start work on the next record fairly soon,” he responded. “I think for the last few albums we’ve been with Warner and we’ve extended after each album. We may do the same again; we may go with a new label, who knows.”\nHe continued, adding that the break between now and their last studio release, 2022’s ‘Will Of The People’, felt “natural” to take after their time touring, and that the members aren’t as willing to share a new record as often as they did in the past.\n“When you finish touring an album, and [when] the band has been around a bit longer, the gaps between albums get a little bit bigger. I don’t think we can be banging out new albums every two years like we used to,” he explained. “But it gives you that opportunity to reset a little bit and think about what’s gonna happen going forward.”\nRecommended\n“I think we’ll start very, very soon, like in the next couple of months,” Wolstenholme added, giving an idea of the timeframe needed. “We’ve got a few gigs in June. Only a handful – that’s the only gigs we’re doing this year.\n“I don’t think the idea is to do anything really serious until next year, so I would imagine that 2026 will be a new album, barring any disasters.”\nThe interview with Wolstenholme comes just months after he shared details of a new project called Chromes and dropped two debut singles. The band saw the bassist take on frontman duties, which came after he sang lead and wrote lyrics for songs ‘Save Me’ and ‘Liquid State’ on Muse’s 2012 album ‘The 2nd Law’.\nAs for the other members, the time since ‘Will Of The People’ has seen frontman Matt Bellamy welcome his second child with partner Elle Evans, and also record a score for an Audible version of 1984.\nAround the time of ‘Will Of The People’s release, Bellamy spoke to NME about what the title of the album means, and said that he feels that a sense of change is coming across society.\nReflecting on the coronavirus pandemic, the war in Ukraine and the cost of living crisis, the frontman said: “I think everyone knows we want a revolution, but we definitely don’t want a bunch of authoritarian lunatics from the right. That’s the last thing we want.\n“And also we don’t want a total communist situation on the hard left either. I think what we want is something completely new. I don’t think it exists out there at the moment, but I think there’s a new type of politics that could emerge,” he added. “I would call it Meta-Centrism. It’s an oscillation between liberal, libertarian values for individuals – your social life, the ability to be whatever gender you are, all that kind of stuff – but then more socialist on things like land ownership, nature and energy distribution. It’s oscillation between the two poles.”", "select_response": "<think>\nThe webpage provides insights into Chris Wolstenholme's comments about Muse's future projects, particularly regarding a new album.

The show was short but a very good one! The singer, Ricky Wilson, is very charismatic and an excellent dancer!\nAbout Muse - Tour Simulation Theory:\nthe sound was very good, the instruments were heard in good frequency and also the voices.\nThe band has a strong connection on stage and a great dynamic between them.\nThe setlist was very well chosen, mixing successful songs from previous albums, like Hysteria, Supermassive and Starlight; and new album hits like: Algorithm, Propaganda and Thought Contagion.\nThe songs were similar to other shows that they played on this tour in all Latin America, but they surprised Santiago with the song Bliss (not in other setlists).\nLead singer Matt sings very well live can make different tones of voice, is incredible, just like the albums!\nIn addition, the lighting games and dancers who were on the stage during the show further contributed to the whole presentation.\nThe show finished with Knights of Cydonia and made everyone very happy!\nA great night! Thank you Muse!\nThis was the 3rd concert I have seen Muse at. I have to say as far as concerts go, you won't find one with any more to it than a Muse concert. I have been to many concerts and I love them all. Music made in a studio is never going to capture the real live sound. Music is made to be played live!\nThe Simulation tour was simply amazing. Visually, audibly and just being there. Having trombones being played, actually played not recorded and being a part of the opening was simply astonishing. It as a great sound and visually it was amazing. The same with Pressure, having the trombones out there added to the song and made it unbelievable.\nThey also played Dig Down the acoustic gospel version live. With Dom, Matt and Chris playing center of the stadium. Chris on the acoustic guitar, Matt on the piano and Dom obviously on the drums. What a neat set to see them playing so close together and the gospel signers on stage lit up by their costumes. Very well done!\nOur son didn't(teenager) didn't understand the Close Encounters of the 3rd kind part. Where Matt was playing the guitar and the mother ship was responding. He is too young. :-) My wife and I got it.\nWatching Matt play his guitar by his tong! What? I had never seen anything like it. He is amazing. Chris is just amazing on bass and Dom on drums. These guys can do it all!\nWhat a fun show. I really appreciate what Muse has done to give back to their fan's. Too many bands don't care as long as they sell their tickets. Muse doesn't appear to be like that. Even purchasing tickets, they allow the true fans to purchase first getting the best seats.\nI look forward to seeing them again! Great show, great music, and a great time. Playing for almost 2 hours. Great job Muse!\nThere is a reason these guys play in big arenas. It’s not just a few guys on a stage playing their music, it’s a production. Even up in the nosebleeds it was a great show.\nSpoiler alert! Don’t read any further if you don’t want to know.\nHad it all! Glowing glasses, lit up suits, giant robots, a piano that shoots lasers, dancers with flashlights, smoke machines and glowing batons, and a special appearance by Eddie! People hanging from wires, surprises coming up from trap doors, lasers, lasers and more lasers! The set was a blistering 26 songs lasting a little over two hours!\nI will definitely see them again the next time they come to town. Though not from the balcony. They say “Don’t look down if you have a thing about heights.” That’s where the stage is!\nGreat show.", "select_response": "<think>\nThe purpose of this search round is to gather recent information about a music artist, including new singles, music videos, collaborations, interviews, future projects, and tours for the years 2024-2025.

Muse is known for a unique style of alt-rock, with electronic music leanings and a blend of classical music, which lends to an ethereal, melancholic sound.\nStarting in the early ’90s under the original name Gothic Plague, the band toured relentlessly with bands such as Skunk Anansie. The band released its first EPs to a loyal fan base and was met with relative success in the UK indie charts. This earned the group crucial backing from the likes of Steve Lamacq and NME, and its debut studio album Showbiz was released in 1999, scoring relative chart success. The album has since gone on to become a certified platinum album in the UK.\nMuse’s second album, released in 2001, revealed a growth in sound and ambition that is still evident in its records today. Origin of Symmetry saw the band shift into progressive rock territory, producing momentous singles like “New Born” and “Bliss.” The album acted as a catalyst that moved Muse into commercial and critical success for years to come. Its next four albums all topped the UK album charts, and the band has sold over 15 million albums worldwide.\nIn 2003, Muse released its third album, Absolution. This album debuted at number one in the UK, and with time, became certified gold in the US. This album is widely considered the band’s breakthrough album, with key hits such as “Time Is Running Out” and “Hysteria” topping the charts. In support of this album, Muse headed out on a year-long international tour.\nIn 2006, Muse released its fourth studio album, Black Holes and Revelations. This album debuted at number one on the charts in five countries. From this album, two singles, \"Supermassive Black Hole\" and \"Knights of Cydonia,\" became chart-toppers, reaching the top 10 hits in the UK.\nMuse’s live shows also followed the same ambitious, gargantuan elevation of music. Famed for its tours, the band has won two Brit Awards for Best Live Act, and it sells out arenas and stadiums around the globe with ease. Muse has become a legendary force on the festival circuit, and has headlined Reading and Leeds, T in the Park, and Glastonbury over the years. At Glastonbury Festival 2010, a gigantic crowd to its pyramid stage set up at the latter event in 2010.\nAround the same time, Muse’s latest album The Resistance was conquering all corners of the UK. The band then scooped three Grammy nominations and a win for Best Rock Album, which helped it officially break into the US. Its explosion in popularity led to its performance at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London – and to its single “Survival” becoming the official anthem of the event.\nSince its acclaimed Olympic performance, Muse has gone on to produce three more albums. Released in 2015, Drones was an album that aimed to return to the original rock sound for which Muse was originally known, but weaved in a powerful statement on the dehumanization of modern warfare. with the release of Drones, Muse began another tour focused on small venues throughout the UK and theAlong US. Drones an immediate hit, topping charts globally.\nAfter touring the globe, including headlining at major festivals, Muse continued its path forward with another album release in 2018 — Simulation Theory. This kicked off the Simulation Theory World Tour, which took the band all the way from Houston, Texas, to a final stop in Lima, Peru.\nAt the end of 2019, Muse released a special compilation box titled Origin of Muse. This included remastered versions of its albums and previously unreleased music. This special edition is a dream come true for Muse fans. The box contains a 48-page book, nine CDs, four vinyl records. One of the highlights of the set is a fully-remastered version of the band’s debut album Showbiz.\nMost recently, in 2022, Muse released the Will of the People. This album showcases the darker, heavier side of Muse’s music, with singles “Won’t Stand Down” and “Compliance” quickly becoming fan favorites.\nKnown for its flawless performances, Muse continues to capture the depth of its musical history in every show. Fans, who are often referred to as Musers, flock to see the band perform at large arenas around the world. Most shows sell out, and in order to find a position near the front of the stage, Musers arrive hours ahead of showtime.\nNot only does Muse deliver an incredibly dynamic and energetic live show, but its sound production is renowned for being top-quality. Bellamy’s vocals can be heard clearly, along with every accompanying instrument. Recently, touring member Morgan Nicholls was replaced by Dan Lancaster. Lancaster now plays additional keys, percussion, and guitar, as well as providing backup vocals.\nTo snag tickets to a Muse tour date, make sure to pay attention to recently released tour schedules. Muse’s 2022-2023 “The Will of the People World” Tour reaches far and wide.\nRead moreEnjoyed the band but not the show. The organizers failed in everything they could fail. Believe me, I've been to a lot of international shows here in Argentina and Chile, and this was the first time ever that I couldn't hear the music some times.\nThe \"Complejo al Río\" is in a great zone of Vicente López, really near to buses, subway, and two of the most important avenues (Av. Santa Fe/Cabildo/Maipú and Av. Libertador); so I got there without any troubles and even had some food because there were a lot of places to eat or drink near it.\nIt all went down when the showtime was getting near: I got in without getting checked, as most people, really dangerous; then, the entrance was full of construction debris (dangerous x2). Once I was in, I realized that the venue was pretty much a cement parking lot with a couple of bleachers, wouldn't be much of a problem if it weren't that: a) there were holes in the floor, so somebody could have get hurt while jumping and; b) it was on downhill, so that meant that in certain areas of the \"campo trasero\" you couldn't see anything.\nWhen it started, everyone was excited, jumping, but two songs in we realised that we couldn't hear sometimes: the sound came and then go away. You could literally heard people talking over the music! And this wasn't an acoustic show! The low-volume stayed the whole gig, and it ruined songs like Madness that I could literally not hear. Bonus track: Matt confused Argentina with Uruguay and used their flag here. Everyone shouting \"NOOO\" which meant hearing even less.\nGoing strictly to the show: the band pulled out a pretty good one, they didn't interacted with the public a lot but considering videos I've seen, that's just how they are. The setlist was the very same of two days ago in Chile, so there's nothing to complain about though we Argentinians are used to the fact that the bands always play more songs here, or change the setlist a bit. Muse was not the case.\nI still had a great time and would totally go to see this band again, specially because I feel like I didn't got the full experience. It's too much to know that they never come with the full stages and theatrics to add the fact that they came without speakers.\nThis was the 3rd concert I have seen Muse at. I have to say as far as concerts go, you won't find one with any more to it than a Muse concert. I have been to many concerts and I love them all. Music made in a studio is never going to capture the real live sound. Music is made to be played live!\nThe Simulation tour was simply amazing. Visually, audibly and just being there. Having trombones being played, actually played not recorded and being a part of the opening was simply astonishing. It as a great sound and visually it was amazing. The same with Pressure, having the trombones out there added to the song and made it unbelievable.\nThey also played Dig Down the acoustic gospel version live. With Dom, Matt and Chris playing center of the stadium. Chris on the acoustic guitar, Matt on the piano and Dom obviously on the drums. What a neat set to see them playing so close together and the gospel signers on stage lit up by their costumes. Very well done!\nOur son didn't(teenager) didn't understand the Close Encounters of the 3rd kind part. Where Matt was playing the guitar and the mother ship was responding. He is too young. :-) My wife and I got it.\nWatching Matt play his guitar by his tong! What? I had never seen anything like it. He is amazing. Chris is just amazing on bass and Dom on drums. These guys can do it all!\nWhat a fun show. I really appreciate what Muse has done to give back to their fan's. Too many bands don't care as long as they sell their tickets. Muse doesn't appear to be like that. Even purchasing tickets, they allow the true fans to purchase first getting the best seats.\nI look forward to seeing them again! Great show, great music, and a great time. Playing for almost 2 hours. Great job Muse!\nOver the course of two decades, Muse’s live show has evolved into one of the most sensational spectacles in the world - an experience worthy of four (!) live DVDs churned out since the release of Hullabaloo in 2001.\nFrom humble beginnings touring the UK dive bar circuit, the band’s intellectual prog-rock quickly earned them the heavy burden of ‘the next Radiohead’: a stigma brushed aside, and a prophecy fulfilled.\nThe band’s trajectory to international stardom was driven in the early noughties by huge success around ‘Origin Of Symmetry’ and ‘Absolution’; a pair of records that delivered sold out arena shows across the globe.\nFrom that point on, Muse poured everything into their live show. From huge satellite dishes beaming light into the sky to monumental, rotating pillars, each tour delivers something totally unexpected, and utterly jawdropping. And that’s prior to any mention of the crazy, crazy talent exhibited on stage. Matt Bellamy, one of the few true rockstars of the modern age, thrashes and strokes at his guitar in equal measure, and delivers stunning falsetto vocals. Though the band have recruited extra, ‘behind-the-scenes’ members over recent years, the amount of noise produced by the three piece remains astounding.\nWith Glastonbury and Coachella headline slots - and just about everything other accolade - under their belts, where now for Muse? Somehow, the only way, still, is up. And it’s guaranteed to be totally bombastic.\nSince their incarnation in 1994, the Devon trio has evolved from a garage rock band into a momentous live act that has conquered the largest stages and festivals all around the planet with their space-themed apoco-pop rock. The band has six albums in its discography, which was not seem like very much for an artist that has reached a reputation as saintly as Muse, yet it is what Matt Bellamy and co transform their music into onstage which continues to wow audiences.\nAs the bass rumbles and begins 'Supremacy', the band appear all at once surrounded by fire and pyrotechnics as they wage some solar war all within their own minds. As they run through their hits such as 'Supermassive Black Hole' and 'Starlight' at blistering speeds, the audience have no choice to watch on in blind amazement. Matt Bellamy is a frontman often likened to the late, great Freddie Mercury and after seeing him perform you realise there is serious weight behind these lofty claims.\nNo matter how big his crowd, Matt throws himself into every blistering guitar solo and whips crowds into frenzies like no other. When the finale of 'Knights Of Cydonia' kicks in, the audience has completely surrendered itself to the supernatural, surreal world of Muse and simply hope they will never return.\nSantiago de Chile - October 13th\nThe first good surprise was with the opening band, Kaiser Chiefs. The show was short but a very good one! The singer, Ricky Wilson, is very charismatic and an excellent dancer!\nAbout Muse - Tour Simulation Theory:\nthe sound was very good, the instruments were heard in good frequency and also the voices.\nThe band has a strong connection on stage and a great dynamic between them.\nThe setlist was very well chosen, mixing successful songs from previous albums, like Hysteria, Supermassive and Starlight; and new album hits like: Algorithm, Propaganda and Thought Contagion.\nThe songs were similar to other shows that they played on this tour in all Latin America, but they surprised Santiago with the song Bliss (not in other setlists).\nLead singer Matt sings very well live can make different tones of voice, is incredible, just like the albums!\nIn addition, the lighting games and dancers who were on the stage during the show further contributed to the whole presentation.\nThe show finished with Knights of Cydonia and made everyone very happy!\nA great night! Thank you Muse!\nI had seen Muse a few times at various festivals over the years (Reading twice, V Festival, Download) and wanted to see them in their own show and I thought what better place than to do that than at Londons O2 Arena.\nMuse played for 2 hours with a faultless performance. Belting out classics such as Plug In Baby, Stockholm Syndrome and completing the evening with the infectious Knights Of Cydonia as well as promoting songs from the current Drones album.\nMy only regret of the evening was having to be upstairs on Level 4 for this concert. People standing in the Floor areas and Level 1 seem to be able to let loose and enjoy themselves but upstairs really didn't know how to behave at a rock concert with he majority remaining seated and I was even asked to sit down by the person behind me. Unfortunately the big arenas can bring out the punters who aren't used to what a rock concert can be about but i'll balance this comment by saying that I should have been downstairs if I really wanted to rock out.\nGreat performance by band, disappointed with the crowd as a whole.\nWe came in from Houston to see Muse in Austin. I've had to miss their TX shows in the past because I didnt have the money or time, but this year I said fuck it, I'm going to this show and I wont miss them again. It was so worth it. They sounded amazing, the whole band are great performers. They posted the whole concert on facebook so I thought that was cool. I can watch it again if I want. So, so worth it. The stage was really cool with these stacks of video monitors in the back and they were staggered. It's hard to describe, but it looked really good. The only complaint I had was that I bought an actual seat but everyone stood the whole time, so it was kind of pointless, but I'm glad I had something to lean on if I got too tired. It was kind of hard to see the band on stage because people were in the way, but I'm sort of short so...oh well. It was a very minor complaint and nothing against Muse. If (I should say WHEN) I see them again, I'll try to get a seat on the rail with no one in front of me, but you know how it goes.\nAn impressive start with \"Psycho\" brought all the energy to the Olympia-halle without any warming up. The setlist was loaded with the tracks of their latest Best-Rock-Album-Grammy winner, \"Drones\", but also included some classics as \"Plug In Baby\", \"Stockholm Syndrome\", and an amazing performance of \"Citizen Erased\", a song from \"Origin of Symmetry\" rarely played in the latest years shows.\nThe stage in itself deserves recognition as it was meant to rotate, while holding a structure from where around ten drones came into the show flashing and wandering around some meters over the crowd. In addition, a series of interactive projections were prepared in accordance to every song lyrics.\nBellamy asked people to help on singing the already classic \"Time Is Running Out\", as well as \"Starlight\" and the whole chorus for \"Uprising\".\nA great show that clarifies why they are one of the best live bands at the moment.\nThere is a reason these guys play in big arenas. It’s not just a few guys on a stage playing their music, it’s a production. Even up in the nosebleeds it was a great show.\nSpoiler alert! Don’t read any further if you don’t want to know.\nHad it all! Glowing glasses, lit up suits, giant robots, a piano that shoots lasers, dancers with flashlights, smoke machines and glowing batons, and a special appearance by Eddie! People hanging from wires, surprises coming up from trap doors, lasers, lasers and more lasers! The set was a blistering 26 songs lasting a little over two hours!\nI will definitely see them again the next time they come to town. Though not from the balcony. They say “Don’t look down if you have a thing about heights.” That’s where the stage is!\nGreat show.\nSaw them in Milan 20/5. I've been attending concerts for more than 10 years now and this gig goes into my top 5!! The show, the energy, the sound (!!) was amazing! I was blown away by Matt's voice, so clear and beautiful, Chris's dexterity with the bass (for me the second best bass player ever) and Dominic's drum solos. I loved the round stage in the center of the arena, you can really see them well from wherever you are standing/seating. I really wish more bands could afford this kind of technology, oh well... And the video projections, especially the puppeteering part during The Handler... genious and scary! The setlist included almost all the songs I wanted to hear live (I only missed Stockholm Syndrome and Bliss). All in all, kudos to the guys, really, I hope too see them again very soon.\nWant to see Muse in concert?

We may do the same again; we may go with a new label, who knows.”\nHe continued, adding that the break between now and their last studio release, 2022’s ‘Will Of The People’, felt “natural” to take after their time touring, and that the members aren’t as willing to share a new record as often as they did in the past.\n“When you finish touring an album, and [when] the band has been around a bit longer, the gaps between albums get a little bit bigger. I don’t think we can be banging out new albums every two years like we used to,” he explained. “But it gives you that opportunity to reset a little bit and think about what’s gonna happen going forward.”\nRecommended\n“I think we’ll start very, very soon, like in the next couple of months,” Wolstenholme added, giving an idea of the timeframe needed. “We’ve got a few gigs in June. Only a handful – that’s the only gigs we’re doing this year.\n“I don’t think the idea is to do anything really serious until next year, so I would imagine that 2026 will be a new album, barring any disasters.”\nThe interview with Wolstenholme comes just months after he shared details of a new project called Chromes and dropped two debut singles. The band saw the bassist take on frontman duties, which came after he sang lead and wrote lyrics for songs ‘Save Me’ and ‘Liquid State’ on Muse’s 2012 album ‘The 2nd Law’.\nAs for the other members, the time since ‘Will Of The People’ has seen frontman Matt Bellamy welcome his second child with partner Elle Evans, and also record a score for an Audible version of 1984.\nAround the time of ‘Will Of The People’s release, Bellamy spoke to NME about what the title of the album means, and said that he feels that a sense of change is coming across society.\nReflecting on the coronavirus pandemic, the war in Ukraine and the cost of living crisis, the frontman said: “I think everyone knows we want a revolution, but we definitely don’t want a bunch of authoritarian lunatics from the right. That’s the last thing we want.\n“And also we don’t want a total communist situation on the hard left either. I think what we want is something completely new. I don’t think it exists out there at the moment, but I think there’s a new type of politics that could emerge,” he added. “I would call it Meta-Centrism. It’s an oscillation between liberal, libertarian values for individuals – your social life, the ability to be whatever gender you are, all that kind of stuff – but then more socialist on things like land ownership, nature and energy distribution. It’s oscillation between the two poles.”", "select_response": "<think>\nThe webpage provides insights into Chris Wolstenholme's comments about Muse's future projects, particularly regarding a new album.

Jared Leto can come off SUPER douchie but he is still charming and talented.\nMuse puts on one of the top 3 rock shows I have ever seen in my life. There is nothing I can say that is negative about that show.\nKeybank Pavilion\nBurgettstown, PA\nOct 08, 2018\nBria\nThis is our 3rd time seeing Muse. Once indoors at Mandalay Bay, once outdoor at Aftershock in Sacramento. This was, BY FAR, the best show I've seen them do. Out of the hundreds of shows I've been to in my life, this was in the top 5. Energy, light show, stage presence, song choices, and stage props were OFF THE HOOK! Can't wait to see them again!\nT-Mobile Arena\nLas Vegas, NV\nApr 10, 2023\nSolomon\nIt was so awesome! My third concert ever, and I've got to say that seeing them live was seriously one of the coolest things I've ever done. If you get a chance to go to a Muse concert, do not hesitate -- buy tickets right then and there, because you never know when the chance to have the time of your life will ever come again.\nNationwide Arena\nColumbus, OH\nMar 24, 2023\nVadim\nThe 2019 Moscow concert was insanely great! Great sound, stunning visuals, setlist was perfectly balanced between new hits and all-time greats, but most importantly the energy and atmosphere that Muse delivered: everything was world-class! Definitely *the* best show I’ve ever been to. Thanks Matt, Chris, Dominic and everybody in the crew for unforgettable memories. Can’t wait for you guys to come back in the future!\nLuzhniki Stadium\nMoskva, Russian Federation\nJun 17, 2019\nMELIRSE\nIncredible ! For a French fan, living this show in UK was ... perfect ! Even the fanbase was nice ! I know I am not totally objective because I love this band but I dont care, I enjoyed each moment and that's it !

With the hip-hop genre dominating the charts and a dazzling new wave of female singers leading an exciting phase of pop music, rock's significance on the large stage has largely been relegated to a handful of legacy and veteran artists.\nThis makes the UK group Muse an intriguing exception. Now well into their third decade, they continue to capture attention with high-concept albums and grandiose concerts brimming with pomp and spectacle.\nEven when there isn’t a new album on the horizon, the trio remains ready to deliver a spectacle, as crowds discovered on Sunday at Abu Dhabi’s Etihad Park.\nPerforming the closing concert of the Abu Dhabi F1 Grand Prix, the show marked their first of the year and started a jaunt that will see them play at Riyadh’s Soundstorm Festival on Friday.\nThe time in between shows hasn’t left them rusty, with the group entering to recorded chants and launching into a blazing version of Won’t Stand Down.\nIt is a shape-shifting highlight. Singer and guitarist Matt Bellamy begins the track with an Eastern-inspired guitar motif before settling into a punchy verse, then launching the song into a wall of crushing guitars and Dominic Howard’s thunderous drumming.\nUp next is Hysteria with singer Bellamy’s potent vocal performance matched in intensity by Chris Wolstenholme’s dazzling bass lines. The song is one of their clearest examples of marrying sharp melodies with their signature technical, prog-rock prowess.\nIt conjures the kind of energy only a committed rock band can deliver. If the Abu Dhabi show is part of their long-awaited return to touring, we can confidently report that Muse shows no signs of losing their will.\nThe concert capped off another dynamic series of concerts at the Abu Dhabi F1 Grand Prix. It began on Thursday with the double bill of DJ Peggy Gou and soul singer Teddy Swims, followed a day later by Maroon 5, before Eminem performed to a capacity crowd of 40,000 people on Saturday.\nAll tickets were exclusive to Abu Dhabi Grand Prix ticket holders.\nSPEC%20SHEET%3A%20NOTHING%20PHONE%20(2A)\n%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EDisplay%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%206.7-inch%20flexible%20Amoled%2C%202%2C412%20x%201%2C080%2C%20394ppi%2C%20120Hz%2C%20Corning%20Gorilla%20Glass%205%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EProcessor%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20MediaTek%20Dimensity%207%2C200%20Pro%2C%204nm%2C%20octa-core%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EMemory%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%208%2F12GB%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3ECapacity%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20128%2F256GB%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EPlatform%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20Android%2014%2C%20Nothing%20OS%202.5%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EMain%20camera%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20Dual%2050MP%20main%2C%20f%2F1.88%20%2B%2050MP%20ultra-wide%2C%20f%2F2.2%3B%20OIS%2C%20EIS%2C%20auto-focus%2C%20ultra%20XDR%2C%20night%20mode%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EMain%20camera%20video%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%204K%20%40%2030fps%2C%20full-HD%20%40%2060fps%3B%20slo-mo%20full-HD%20at%20120fps%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EFront%20camera%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%2032MP%20wide%2C%20f%2F2.2%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EBattery%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%205%2C000mAh%3B%2050%25%20in%2030%20minutes%20with%2045-watt%20charger%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EConnectivity%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20Wi-Fi%2C%20Bluetooth%205.3%2C%20NFC%20(Google%20Pay)%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EBiometrics%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20Fingerprint%2C%20face%20unlock%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EI%2FO%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20USB-C%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EDurability%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20IP54%2C%20limited%20protection%20from%20water%2Fdust%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3ECards%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20Dual-nano%20SIM%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EColours%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20Black%2C%20milk%2C%20white%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EIn%20the%20box%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20Nothing%20Phone%20(2a)%2C%20USB-C-to-USB-C%20cable%2C%20pre-applied%20screen%20protector%2C%20Sim%20tray%20ejector%20tool%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EPrice%20(UAE)%3A%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20Dh1%2C199%20(8GB%2F128GB)%20%2F%20Dh1%2C399%20(12GB%2F256GB)%3C%2Fp%3E%0A\nNEW%20PRICING%20SCHEME%20FOR%20APPLE%20MUSIC%2C%20TV%2B%20AND%20ONE\n%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EApple%20Music%3Cbr%3EMonthly%20individual%3A%20%3C%2Fstrong%3E%2410.99%20(from%20%249.99)%3Cstrong%3E%3Cbr%3EMonthly%20family%3A%20%3C%2Fstrong%3E%2416.99%20(from%20%2414.99)%3Cstrong%3E%3Cbr%3EIndividual%20annual%3A%20%3C%2Fstrong%3E%24109%20(from%20%2499)%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EApple%20TV%2B%3Cbr%3EMonthly%3A%20%3C%2Fstrong%3E%246.99%20(from%20%244.99)%3Cstrong%3E%3Cbr%3EAnnual%3A%20%3C%2Fstrong%3E%2469%20(from%20%2449.99)%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%3Cp%3E%3Cstrong%3EApple%20One%3Cbr%3EMonthly%20individual%3A%20%3C%2Fstrong%3E%2416.95%20(from%20%2414.95)%3Cstrong%3E%3Cbr%3EMonthly%20family%3A%20%3C%2Fstrong%3E%2422.95%20(from%20%2419.95)%3Cstrong%3E%3Cbr%3EMonthly%20premier%3A%20%3C%2Fstrong%3E%2432.95%20(from%20%2429.95)%3C%2Fp%3E%0A\nDr Amal Khalid Alias revealed a recent case of a woman with daughters, who specifically wanted a boy.\nA semen analysis of the father showed abnormal sperm so the couple required IVF.\nOut of 21 eggs collected, six were unused leaving 15 suitable for IVF.\nA specific procedure was used, called intracytoplasmic sperm injection where a single sperm cell is inserted into the egg.\nOn day three of the process, 14 embryos were biopsied for gender selection.\nThe next day, a pre-implantation genetic report revealed four normal male embryos, three female and seven abnormal samples.\nDay five of the treatment saw two male embryos transferred to the patient.\nThe woman recorded a positive pregnancy test two weeks later.\nThe Sand Castle\nDirector: Matty Brown\nStars: Nadine Labaki, Ziad Bakri, Zain Al Rafeea, Riman Al Rafeea\nRating: 2.5/5\nLiving in...\nThis article is part of a guide on where to live in the UAE.

Read More: Muse: “There’s gonna be a big …\nContent: Chris Wolstenholme has opened up about the future of Muse, and suggested that the band are already thinking about a new album.\nThe bassist opened up about potential new material from the band during a new interview on The Leona Graham Podcast, and suggested that fans can hope to see a new album being shared in 2026.\nDuring the interview, Wolstenholme was asked about the current status of the band – particularly with them not being signed to any label at the moment – and asked if this is something that would have to change before they could share any new music.\n“We will [sign to a label], obviously. I think we’re gonna start work on the next record fairly soon,” he responded. “I think for the last few albums we’ve been with Warner and we’ve extended after each album. We may do the same again; we may go with a new label, who knows.”\nHe continued, adding that the break between now and their last studio release, 2022’s ‘Will Of The People’, felt “natural” to take after their time touring, and that the members aren’t as willing to share a new record as often as they did in the past.\n“When you finish touring an album, and [when] the band has been around a bit longer, the gaps between albums get a little bit bigger. I don’t think we can be banging out new albums every two years like we used to,” he explained. “But it gives you that opportunity to reset a little bit and think about what’s gonna happen going forward.”\nRecommended\n“I think we’ll start very, very soon, like in the next couple of months,” Wolstenholme added, giving an idea of the timeframe needed. “We’ve got a few gigs in June. Only a handful – that’s the only gigs we’re doing this year.\n“I don’t think the idea is to do anything really serious until next year, so I would imagine that 2026 will be a new album, barring any disasters.”\nThe interview with Wolstenholme comes just months after he shared details of a new project called Chromes and dropped two debut singles. The band saw the bassist take on frontman duties, which came after he sang lead and wrote lyrics for songs ‘Save Me’ and ‘Liquid State’ on Muse’s 2012 album ‘The 2nd Law’.\nAs for the other members, the time since ‘Will Of The People’ has seen frontman Matt Bellamy welcome his second child with partner Elle Evans, and also record a score for an Audible version of 1984.\nAround the time of ‘Will Of The People’s release, Bellamy spoke to NME about what the title of the album means, and said that he feels that a sense of change is coming across society.\nReflecting on the coronavirus pandemic, the war in Ukraine and the cost of living crisis, the frontman said: “I think everyone knows we want a revolution, but we definitely don’t want a bunch of authoritarian lunatics from the right. That’s the last thing we want.\n“And also we don’t want a total communist situation on the hard left either. I think what we want is something completely new. I don’t think it exists out there at the moment, but I think there’s a new type of politics that could emerge,” he added. “I would call it Meta-Centrism. It’s an oscillation between liberal, libertarian values for individuals – your social life, the ability to be whatever gender you are, all that kind of stuff – but then more socialist on things like land ownership, nature and energy distribution. It’s oscillation between the two poles.”", "select_response": "<think>\nThe webpage discusses Chris Wolstenholme's comments regarding the future of Muse and the potential for a new album.

Read More: Muse: “There’s gonna be a big …\nContent: Chris Wolstenholme has opened up about the future of Muse, and suggested that the band are already thinking about a new album.\nThe bassist opened up about potential new material from the band during a new interview on The Leona Graham Podcast, and suggested that fans can hope to see a new album being shared in 2026.\nDuring the interview, Wolstenholme was asked about the current status of the band – particularly with them not being signed to any label at the moment – and asked if this is something that would have to change before they could share any new music.\n“We will [sign to a label], obviously. I think we’re gonna start work on the next record fairly soon,” he responded. “I think for the last few albums we’ve been with Warner and we’ve extended after each album. We may do the same again; we may go with a new label, who knows.”\nHe continued, adding that the break between now and their last studio release, 2022’s ‘Will Of The People’, felt “natural” to take after their time touring, and that the members aren’t as willing to share a new record as often as they did in the past.\n“When you finish touring an album, and [when] the band has been around a bit longer, the gaps between albums get a little bit bigger. I don’t think we can be banging out new albums every two years like we used to,” he explained. “But it gives you that opportunity to reset a little bit and think about what’s gonna happen going forward.”\nRecommended\n“I think we’ll start very, very soon, like in the next couple of months,” Wolstenholme added, giving an idea of the timeframe needed. “We’ve got a few gigs in June. Only a handful – that’s the only gigs we’re doing this year.\n“I don’t think the idea is to do anything really serious until next year, so I would imagine that 2026 will be a new album, barring any disasters.”\nThe interview with Wolstenholme comes just months after he shared details of a new project called Chromes and dropped two debut singles. The band saw the bassist take on frontman duties, which came after he sang lead and wrote lyrics for songs ‘Save Me’ and ‘Liquid State’ on Muse’s 2012 album ‘The 2nd Law’.\nAs for the other members, the time since ‘Will Of The People’ has seen frontman Matt Bellamy welcome his second child with partner Elle Evans, and also record a score for an Audible version of 1984.\nAround the time of ‘Will Of The People’s release, Bellamy spoke to NME about what the title of the album means, and said that he feels that a sense of change is coming across society.\nReflecting on the coronavirus pandemic, the war in Ukraine and the cost of living crisis, the frontman said: “I think everyone knows we want a revolution, but we definitely don’t want a bunch of authoritarian lunatics from the right. That’s the last thing we want.\n“And also we don’t want a total communist situation on the hard left either. I think what we want is something completely new. I don’t think it exists out there at the moment, but I think there’s a new type of politics that could emerge,” he added. “I would call it Meta-Centrism. It’s an oscillation between liberal, libertarian values for individuals – your social life, the ability to be whatever gender you are, all that kind of stuff – but then more socialist on things like land ownership, nature and energy distribution. It’s oscillation between the two poles.”", "select_response": "<think>\nThe webpage discusses Chris Wolstenholme's comments regarding the future of Muse and the potential for a new album.

This album is a personal navigation through those fears and preparation for what comes next.”\nNow the band has offered more details on what to expect, telling Apple Music 1 that the album spans genres.\n“We’ve always tried to think outside the box,” Bellamy said (via NME). “We’ve never been one particular genre.\n“This album goes from metal all the way to pop to my first version to an Adele song… a lot of electronica. It’s like a full…We produced it ourselves. We were analysing everything we’ve done to date. The last song on the album is called ‘We Are Fucking Fucked’. I’m really happy and proud of it. I genuinely think it’s our best album.”\nBellamy also revealed that he let drummer Dominic Howard “take the lead a little bit” on this project.\n“That’s why this album’s taken two years. Every decision takes like a week for him to come back to us. Normally I just rush everything. With him he’s really slow, takes his time with every decision. I allowed him to make a lot of decisions about what was good and what wasn’t.”\nLast week Muse released latest single ‘Compliance’, following January’s comeback track ‘Won’t Stand Down’ – their first new music since 2018’s ‘Simulation Theory’.\n‘Will Of The People’ is available to pre-order here.\n‘Will of the People’ tracklist:\n1. ‘Will Of The People‘\n2. ‘Compliance‘\n3. ‘Liberation‘\n4. ‘Won’t Stand Down‘\n5. ‘Ghosts (How Can I Move On)‘\n6. ‘You Make Me Feel Like It’s Halloween‘\n7. ‘Kill Or Be Killed‘\n8. ‘Verona‘\n9. ‘Euphoria‘\n10. ‘We Are Fucking Fucked‘", "select_response": "<think>\nThe purpose of the search round is to gather more information about Muse's upcoming album \"Eclipse,\" including specific details like the tracklist, themes, singles, and any recent music videos or detailed interviews.
