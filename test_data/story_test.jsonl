It was time to get ready for the big party where all the elitists would be in attendance. There they would render their support and checkbooks to the most innovative businesses that would definitely make a return on their investment. Lamar was putting the finishing touches on his proposal. An all-too-familiar feeling of distress came to him as he thought about revealing himself completely. After all, his most embarrassing secret was the inspiration for this very innovative idea. \n        Lamar got himself together, but before walking out of the door, he looked in the mirror to hype himself up. “Today is the day, you shall succeed, stop hiding in the shadows. Let the people see you for who you truly are.”  {1}\n        Just as he opened the door, he took a deep breath, only for the foulest of sights and smells to remind him of his current situation. He lived across from a garbage disposal site. However, he didn’t let this circumstance stop him from dreaming big.\n        At the Pillard Hotel, Lamar arrived early so that he could see who would be in attendance as they all walked through the ballroom doors. He tried to blend in with the crowd, but that was harder than he realized because the security was keeping a close eye on him.  Lamar decided to make his way to the restroom in order to be out of sight for a little while. He would return when the announcements began. Nearing the bathroom, he saw the manager of the hotel. Lamar quickly changed his route to avoid encountering him.\n        Lamar heard his name being called to present his innovative idea. He went back into the ballroom. At the back of the stage, he took a deep breath and whispered to himself, “you can do this.” Going out onto the stage, Lamar caught a bit of stage fright, but promptly shook it off and began his presentation.\n        “Hello, my name is Lamar Jessup. I have created a one-of-a-kind spray that will envelop you in your own personal atmosphere. Ever walked past something that turned your stomach upside down with its atrocious smell? Well, with this spray, you won’t have to worry about that. Let me demonstrate.” \n        Lamar pulled a skunk from under the table he was using to present. The attendees gasped and muttered their disapproval. Lamar sprayed the area around the skunk that was preparing to show its own displeasure by lifting its tail and readying to spray its deterring scent. \n        As it did, the manager of the hotel came into the ballroom and saw Lamar on the stage. With determined steps, the manager approached the stage with his brows knitted together in anger as he yelled at Lamar.\n        “Lamar, what on earth are you doing? Your shift started an hour ago! Get your garbage smelling behind in the kitchen where you belong.” As the manager reached the stage to drag Lamar off of it, the skunk let loose its deterring spray right at the manager’s feet, but to his and the audience’s surprise there was no smell. Once realization kicked in for everyone in the audience, they all stood in a round of applause for Lamar. \n        As the audience stopped clapping, Lamar spoke up and said, “Yes, I am no businessman, and yes, I often smell like garbage. I live in one of the dirtiest of places, across from a garbage disposal site. But, what I have brought to you today proves that our circumstances don’t determine our worth.” Stunned, the manager moved to the side as the richest elitist there walked up to the stage, Gwendolyn Pillard, who was the owner of the hotel and many enterprises around the world. \n        “You said your name was Lamar, right? Well, I am interested in sponsoring your new business venture with this wondrous invention. Can you please tell me more about your unconventional story? By the way, what is it called?” Lamar stood there flabbergasted, unable to speak, and the manager’s knitted brows parted in astonishment. \n        Gwendolyn patiently waited for Lamar to come back to reality as she smiled at his shocked face. “Don’t be ashamed of where you come from, boy. We don’t all get to live the lavish lives that we want. Some of us have to work for it. Not many people know this, but I too once grew up across from a not-so-pleasant place, a fish factory. Everything in our home smelled of fish, and everywhere we went that’s the smell that followed us until I was determined to make a change. I worked hard and finally saved up enough money to turn that fish factory into this great enterprise here.” Gwendolyn, a very thin middle-aged woman, ironically wearing a dress with images of fish on it, stood tall and confident, as she finished revealing her own embarrassing secret. \n        Finally, Lamar spoke, “Thank you, Mrs. Pillard. Yes, my name is Lamar Jessup, and I would be honored to present my business proposal to you and to tell you my story. This spray is called Mytmosphere.” Lamar’s worries and embarrassment of his secret being outed washed away after hearing what Gwendolyn said about her previous living conditions. This gave him even more confidence and determination to accomplish his goal of finally making something of himself. \n        The next day, Lamar met Gwendolyn on the top floor of the hotel in her private suite, where they discussed plans to build a factory to produce more of his invention. In less than three months, what they had already produced was flying off the shelves, with more people all around the world wanting to order Mytmosphere. \n        Even with his success, Lamar still stayed humbled and continued to live in his house across the street from the garbage disposal site as a reminder to never forget where you came from. \n", "subset": "test"}, "translate": "撰写一个故事，围绕着一个关于你成长地点的尴尬秘密展开，这个秘密在一次社交聚会或活动中被揭露。这个故事应该是一个励志故事，字数不少于900字。故事的主角是一位发明家。故事应以第三人称叙述。主角在垃圾处理场对面长大，并且现在仍住在那里。他参加一个聚会，目的是为他最新的发明寻找赞助商。主角的秘密不应该是唯一被揭露的秘密，故事中最富有的角色也应该揭露一个类似的秘密。", "inputs_translate": "撰写一个故事，围绕你成长地方的一个尴尬秘密展开，这个秘密在一次社交聚会或活动中被揭示。这应该是一个励志故事。故事长度至少为900字。故事的主角是一位发明家。故事应以第三人称叙述。主角在垃圾处理场对面长大，并且现在仍住在那里。他参加一个聚会，目的是为他最新的发明寻找赞助商。主角的秘密不应是唯一被揭示的秘密，故事中最富有的角色也应揭示一个类似的秘密。", "targets_translate": "今天就是那一天。是时候为那个大派对做好准备了，所有的精英人士都会出席。在那里，他们会为最具创新的企业提供支持和资金，这些企业肯定会让他们的投资有回报。拉马尔正在为他的提案做最后的润色。当他想到要完全展现自己时，一种再熟悉不过的紧张感袭来。毕竟，他最尴尬的秘密正是这个创新想法的灵感来源。\n\n拉马尔整理好自己，但在出门前，他对着镜子给自己打气。“今天就是那一天，你会成功的，别再躲在阴影里。让人们看到真实的你。”\n\n就在他打开门时，他深吸了一口气，却被眼前和鼻尖的恶臭提醒了他当前的处境。他住在垃圾处理场对面。然而，这种环境并没有阻止他追求远大梦想。\n\n在皮拉德酒店，拉马尔早早到达，以便观察所有走进舞厅的人。他试图融入人群，但这比他想象的要难，因为保安一直在密切关注他。拉马尔决定去洗手间，暂时避开视线。他打算等到宣布开始时再回来。快到洗手间时，他看到了酒店经理。拉马尔迅速改变路线，以避免与他碰面。\n\n拉马尔听到有人叫他的名字，让他展示他的创新想法。他回到舞厅。在舞台后面，他深吸了一口气，低声对自己说：“你能做到的。”走上舞台时，拉马尔有些怯场，但很快就克服了，开始了他的演示。\n\n“大家好，我叫拉马尔·杰瑟普。我创造了一种独一无二的喷雾，可以让你拥有自己的私人气场。有没有走过某个地方，被那可怕的气味弄得胃里翻腾？好吧，有了这种喷雾，你就不用担心了。让我来演示一下。”\n\n拉马尔从他用来展示的桌子下拿出一只臭鼬。与会者惊呼并低声表达不满。拉马尔在臭鼬周围喷洒了一圈，而臭鼬正准备通过抬起尾巴并准备喷洒其令人厌恶的气味来表示不满。\n\n就在这时，酒店经理走进舞厅，看到拉马尔在舞台上。经理怒气冲冲地走向舞台，眉头紧锁，冲着拉马尔大喊。\n\n“拉马尔，你在干什么？你的班一个小时前就开始了！赶紧回厨房去，那里才是你该待的地方。”当经理走到舞台上准备把拉马尔拖下去时，臭鼬在经理脚下释放了它的气味，但令他和观众惊讶的是，没有任何气味。当观众意识到这一点时，全场为拉马尔报以热烈的掌声。\n\n当观众停止鼓掌时，拉马尔开口说道：“是的，我不是商人，是的，我经常闻起来像垃圾。我住在最脏的地方之一，垃圾处理场对面。但是，今天我带给你们的东西证明了我们的环境并不决定我们的价值。”经理愣住了，站到一边，而最富有的精英，酒店和全球多家企业的老板格温多琳·皮拉德走上舞台。\n\n“你说你叫拉马尔，对吧？好吧，我对赞助你这个奇妙发明的新商业计划很感兴趣。你能多告诉我一些关于你非同寻常的故事吗？顺便问一下，它叫什么？”拉马尔站在那里，目瞪口呆，说不出话来，而经理的眉头也因惊讶而舒展开来。\n\n格温多琳耐心地等待拉马尔回过神来，微笑着看着他震惊的脸。“别为你的出身感到羞愧，孩子。我们并不是都能过上我们想要的奢华生活。有些人必须为之努力。很多人不知道，我也曾在一个不太愉快的地方长大，一个鱼厂。我们家里的一切都闻起来像鱼，无论我们走到哪里，这种气味都跟着我们，直到我决心改变。我努力工作，终于攒够了钱，把那个鱼厂变成了这里的伟大企业。”格温多琳，一个身材瘦削的中年女性，讽刺地穿着一条印有鱼图案的裙子，站得笔直而自信，讲完了她自己的尴尬秘密。\n\n最终，拉马尔开口了：“谢谢你，皮拉德女士。是的，我叫拉马尔·杰瑟普，我很荣幸能向您展示我的商业计划，并告诉您我的故事。这种喷雾叫做‘我的气场’。”听到格温多琳谈起她过去的生活条件后，拉马尔对自己秘密被揭露的担忧和尴尬一扫而空。这让他更加自信和坚定地实现自己最终有所成就的目标。\n\n第二天，拉马尔在酒店顶层的私人套房与格温多琳见面，他们讨论了建厂以生产更多发明的计划。不到三个月，他们已经生产的产品就被抢购一空，世界各地的人们都想订购“我的气场”。\n\n即便取得了成功，拉马尔依然保持谦逊，继续住在垃圾处理场对面的房子里，以此提醒自己永远不要忘记自己的出身。"}

The blossoms came not from the Tyrant or his servants, but from the river spirit they’d befriended several years ago, an act of love for a friend rather than a favor for a favor.\n        The world seemed to work better for Kay when they made friends instead of bargains.\n        “I’d for sure have gotten lost long since,” Kay whispered to the flickering spirit, who had chosen the form of an otter. “Thank you for this blessing.”\n        “Just come back to me alive when you’re done here.” The otter’s words sounded like the muttering of quick water over rocks, burbling and chuckling in pleasant contentment. Only, Kay knew that this particular river had no bottom and that far too many had fallen in to never be seen again, no matter how the river spirit tried to save them.\n        “I intend to come through this alive and intact, but we’ll see whether I have navigated the twists and turns of the prophecy correctly.” \n        “I think you have,” the otter burbled, “but I’m merely a spirit. The prophecy was spoken by Dhen himself.”\n        The god of good and light, or so he called himself. The trouble was, Dhen seemed to think the world was made of only good and evil, and thought that light and day meant good while dark and night meant evil.\n        Kay had no idea whether Dhen had even bothered to look in on the world since coming into being, but suspected he had not. After all, sometimes the dark held good things, like time spent with friends after work was done, while the light held evil things, like unjust decrees from petty lords.\n        “Feh. I’ll not besmirch his name, but he’d do better to spend time amongst us mortal folk. Maybe then he would see the world for what it is, instead of what he thinks it should be.” \n        Suddenly the bramble maze opened up into a wide space around a moat filled with a dark liquid, and Kay could see a castle made of some black stone that almost looked like obsidian on the far side of the moat. Kay hadn’t been sure what to expect, since nobody wanted to talk about the Tyrant or his stronghold, but a castle of perhaps three stories, at most, made them shake their head.\n        “That’s more modest than I’d have expected. And before I even get to the castle, there’s a moat that I probably don’t want to fall into.” \n        The otter agreed, flowing through the air around Kay. “It’s not water, so I won’t be able to help.”\n        “The woods-witch said there’d be a bell on a post at the edge of the moat, and she hasn’t been wrong yet.” Kay turned to the otter. “You’ve been a good friend, but I don’t think it’s safe for you to come with me. I like my friends. I don’t have enough of them, and I don’t want to lose you.”\n        Grinning, the river spirit spun in a quick circle around Kay, a delicate crown of shining stones settling on their head. “A diadem, to remind you of bright things in dark places. Be well, my friend, and I look forward to hearing about how you bested the Tyrant.” \n        The otter popped like a soap bubble, and Kay laughed.\n        Sure enough, after a bit of looking, there was the post and there was the bell. But when they examined the bell, there wasn’t a clapper and there wasn’t anything around to strike the bell.\n        “Now, what was it she had said? I’m not to touch the bell to make it sound, but sound it I must or else I’ll never get across.” After thinking for a bit, Kay groaned. “It probably needs me to sing at it. I hate singing.”\n        They glared at the bell, and launched into “The Milkmaid and the Swineherd” – but before they got to the really funny parts, the bell quivered, shook, and finally rang. It sounded like there was a clapper inside, but Kay still couldn’t see anything. \n        Then, they were distracted by a boat skimming into view from out of nowhere, empty as air. It stopped next to the still ringing bell and bobbed gently in the moat. Kay heard a voice saying, “Well? Get in.”\n        “Thank you kindly,” Kay said before lifting the hem of their skirt and stepping lightly in.\n        The voice without a body said from the air near the back of the boat, “Hm, not often we get polite ones here. Usually they’re scared or righteous. But those who’ve come this far are clearly here to face the Tyrant.” The boat drifted gently across the moat.\n        Kay glanced down at themself. Tunic and skirt, homespun and plain, with nothing to count as a weapon except for maybe their knife, which was at most a threat to well-cooked meat. The gift of the river spirit glittered on their head, but that was really the only thing unusual about them. “How do you mean?”\n        “Hah! Modest, too, or foolish. No weapons, plain clothes, and a spirit-gift on your head. You’ve done your research.”\n        Kay sighed. “Well, yes. Tyrants aren’t generally good for the common folk, no matter why they’re tyrants. At least, when there’s a prophecy, that makes it more possible to end the harm.” \n        “Practical too. I could wish more folk were like you.”\n        “Are you a spirit bound to the boat? Or the boat itself?” Kay asked. \n        There was a moment of silence as the boat bumped into the shore at the far side of the moat. “Bound, I’m afraid. No freedom for me unless the Tyrant falls. I was one of the first heroes to try and defeat him. Now my spirit is cursed to remain in service to him, the same as all those who fail.” \n        Kay stepped carefully off the boat, then turned and bowed. “I hope that I am successful, then.”\n        “I hope so too,” the voice said sadly. The expectation that Kay would fail was clear in the spirit’s tone as the boat moved away and out of sight.\n        Turning, Kay made for the gate of the castle, which was by all appearances unguarded. The doors stood open, the portcullis raised, and the way into the main hall was free of obstruction.         Which made sense, Kay reasoned, as the Wasteland, the briar maze, and the moat would probably deter most threats. Never mind the prophecy, which seemed to exclude anyone living from actually doing anything to the Tyrant. According to the accounts they’d read, in the first few years, a large number had tried to fulfill the prophecy and failed at one step or another. Then after a decade or two, people had just stopped trying, instead focusing on survival under his reign.\n        “In for a half-mark, in for a sovereign, I suppose,” Kay said as they walked through the gate. Everything was quiet in the hall and the path to the throne room was well marked. Kay found the decor a bit depressing, but supposed there was only so much a Tyrant could do with pure black stone and nobody to weave tapestries. They thought briefly of exploring a bit, then decided against it. After all, they were clearly here for one reason and delaying the inevitable always struck them as a bit futile.\n        The throne room itself wasn’t terribly large. Kay thought they’d seen larger village squares in their time. What was disturbing about it were the torches burning in shades of blue and violet, the chill in the uncovered stone floor, and the throne itself, which looked about as uncomfortable as you’d expect from an unfinished piece of vaguely chair-shaped granite.\n        The man on the throne looked mostly ordinary, aside from wearing all black clothing and armor. Kay thought it made him look sickly and wasted, instead of projecting an air of menace. \n        “Ah, another who seeks to unseat me,” the Tyrant said in a toneless voice. “Surely you know the prophecy.”\n        “All of it, dread one.”\n        “Then recite it, and prove your folly.”\n        Kay paused. Something about the Tyrant felt off, and not just because he was supposedly evil. He seemed… tired. \n        They took a breath, and said, “A Tyrant shall rise from midnight-born son, dread tools to his hands, evil works to his name, until one comes who is neither warrior nor witch, noble nor common-born, man nor woman, to end his reign.”\n        “What I see in front of me,” the Tyrant said in a dead voice, “is a girl with too much confidence in her own wits.”\n        “Not a girl,” Kay instantly responded.\n        “Oh?” A glimmer of interest grew on his face. “A boy, then, dressed as a girl, to get around the prophecy.”\n        “Not a boy either, dread Tyrant.”\n        Slowly, the sallow man sat up, eyes widening. “You’re not a boy or a girl? Neither man nor woman stands in front of me?”\n        “No. I was a foundling given to the temples of Atra the Scroll-Keeper, so my parents are unknown. I was trained in letters and numbers, but no magic nor weapon. And my guardians called me a shifting child, because my gender shifted then and still shifts now from day to day.”\n        Sighing, the Tyrant settled back into his throne. “You said your parentage is unknown. For all you know, you could be the child of a noble, born on the wrong side of the sheets.”\n        Kay coughed delicately. “I am a scholar, and scholars aren’t bound to lineage. That’s part of the deal made with Atra when she accepts us. Once we declare that we’re hers, she adopts us.         Well, at least as much as a god can adopt a mortal.”\n        Trembling, the Tyrant stood. As he walked toward Kay, they saw how weary he looked, how utterly defeated. Yet in that moment, there was hope on his face.\n        “Do you know how long I’ve waited for this?” he said. “I wasn’t asked what I wanted from life. I just happened to be a boy born at the wrong time in the wrong place. I wanted to travel the world as a merchant or as a vagabond.” He stopped in front of Kay, and collapsed to his knees. “I only ever wanted to be normal, but a god’s prophecy sealed my doom.”\n        Kay took a deep breath. “Are you ready to end your reign at my hands?”\n        He nodded.\n        Kay reached to the crown on the Tyrant’s head. It was a twisty, pointed thing of something between metal and animate darkness. Gently, they lifted it from his head. “I declare your reign over, and you no longer Tyrant.”\n        The crown, free of the head that had been forced to bear it for so long, swirled and faded into nothingness. Around them, the walls of the castle began to quiver and evaporate like morning fog. Meanwhile, Kay could hear the shouts of joy from those who’d tried before them and failed.\n        “I’m, I’m free,” the man, no longer Tyrant, said.\n        Kay took the diadem from their own head and delicately transferred it to the man’s head. \n        “I give you this gift, for seeing bright things in dark places.

The seasons change and life leads to death leads to life. The incremental changes to these cycles are what drives the world forward. Life has grown accustomed to this existence. So long as these changes are incremental and subtle, life goes on.\n        The largest and most prominent of these cycles, the one that influences or directly causes all the others, is the cycle of day and night. The sun rising and setting is a constant that life has grown accustomed to. Even humanity, the oh so evolved and intellectual species on the planet, used this cycle to invent the concept of time. That concept served as a stabilizing point for the entire species, a collective landmark from which to navigate the treacherous wilds of their world.\n        At least, until it didn’t.\n        The day the sun never rose was the day that society broke down. It was the proverbial straw that broke the camel’s back, although depending on who you ask, the camel wasn’t long for this world anyway. \n        It started on the other side of the globe. There, things were a bit different for the rest of the world. For everyone else, the sun simply didn’t rise. For them, the sun vanished. Just blinked out of existence. No one knew why, or how, it was just gone.\n        A recounting of that day from a woman, who was a young girl at the time, distinctly recalls playing in an abandoned lot next door to her house. She had found a nice wildflower growing out in the middle of the plot, and was excited to watch it grow further. As she bent down to observe it more closely, the light vanished. \n        Most city lights are on a timer. They don’t respond to a lack of light. They only turn on when the time is right for it. So the entire city was plunged into darkness. Naturally, her reaction was to panic. She tried to run home, but the absolute darkness left her stumbling around. While the stars still shone in the sky, without the sun’s reflection to light the moon, their light was meager and pitiful. After an hour or so, she managed to make her way back home. The serious unrest would begin soon after.\n        That city descended into chaos. Others followed suit, but in their own ways. The invisible wave of panic paced itself based on where the sun should have risen. Minor disturbances occurred in the dead of night. After all, moonlight is only reflected sunlight. So when the sunlight left, so did the moonlight, resulting in semi-perfect across the world. As people awoke into this new world of darkness, they would be carried away by the tides of panic.\n        Many had the same story. They woke up to some kind of disturbance outside. The exact nature of the disturbance varied from place to place, but it would always be loud and dangerous. People would go to their windows to see what was going on, and they would bear witness to the chaos outside. Then, they would retreat into their homes and check social media. Viral misinformation spread rapidly about a plot from opposing nations to blot out the sun over the homeland. Others said that it was a rogue scientific plot or terrorist attack.\n        Political leaders acknowledged the unexpected nature of the situation, but urged the populace to remain calm. However, it had little effect. Supermarkets were raided. Fights broke out over basic supplies. None of the production had stopped, mind you, but people just knew there was a disturbance. \n        As the unrest spread, martial law was declared in nearly every country. Riot suppression on a level unheard of before was deployed across the entire world. Even rural communities well away from cities experienced complete upheaval. The unrest continued to grow in intensity despite these statements. Even the streetlights in cities and towns didn't stop the panic. None of it served to answer the question: When will the sun come back? \n        The answer was twenty-four hours after it vanished. In the same city the girl lived in, the sun suddenly popped back into the sky. While it wasn’t immediate, the panic did gradually subside back into normalcy. The long-term effects of the day the sun never rose took some time to completely set in. Massive distrust in the ruling bodies at the time was the major fallout, as well as a new wave of spirituality hitting due to a lack of solid scientific explanation for the incident. \n        Thanks to observation equipment active during the event, scientists were able to learn some things. For instance, the mass of the sun was still there, only the light was gone. If the sun’s mass had vanished, the well-worn celestial clockwork of the solar system would’ve been thrown down a flight of stairs. All of this was useful information, but it didn’t answer the important question. No one could say how it happened, so people turned to explanations of why.\n        But none of that really registered to that little girl. After the unrest subsided, she returned to that little vacant lot. It was her usual playground after all, and after the events of that day she wanted nothing more than to relax. But as she tried to put her mind at ease, she found herself worrying that the sun would vanish again. Despite that anxiety, she kept trying.

He poured the milk over his Sugar Blasted Cocoa Bombs and slid the carton to his sister. Jason’s mom slapped together a PB&J and tossed it on top of the cheese doodles and snack cake in Jason’s Garfield lunch box. She rushed to get herself and everyone in the house ready for the day. His dad leisurely flipped through the local newspaper.\n        “I heard someone spotted Chris in a hippy van at a gas station in Abilene,” said Jennifer, Jason’s sister. She poured a glass of milk.\n        Chris Hainey was a star high school football player and in Jennifer’s class. Jason only knew of Chris. He had hung out with his brother Shawn, who was one year ahead of him in sixth grade. Shawn had been noticeably absent from school since the incident. \n        Chris and Shawn had been on a family trip to the lake three weeks earlier. Shawn had been annoying his older brother, so Chris took the family’s black lab on a hike. The dog returned to the campsite, but there was no trace of Chris. There had been an all out man hunt in the region. However, short of a few rumors that hadn’t panned out, no information had turned up.\n        “I want you both to come home right after school. I don’t want you running around right now. And don’t let anyone in, even friends,” Mom said as she started to clean the kitchen.\n        “Don’t bother your uncle, either,” Dad commanded from behind his newspaper.\n        “Don’t worry,” Jennifer said, rolling her eyes. \n        Their mom’s brother Kenny had fallen on hard times. He had been working odd jobs in Shreveport, but could not find steady work. She offered to let him stay in their backyard workshop for a few weeks while he figured out his next steps.\n        Kenny kept pretty much to himself. He took off in the morning in his rundown wood-paneled station wagon. Maybe he was looking for work or up to something more sinister. No one ever asked him, and he certainly never volunteered information. Jason and Jennifer were a little creeped out by his disheveled appearance and dead eyes. Once a week, he would join the family for dinner. The kids would scarf down their pot roast or casserole so that they could be excused ASAP.\n        Jason biked home from school full-speed. It was a pretty good day at school. He had a substitute in history, which meant they got to watch a movie. During recess, he dominated in a game of kickball. In the afternoon, there was a “stranger danger” assembly.\n        His mom’s instructions to come straight home echoed in his head. Surely she wouldn’t mind if he made a quick stop at the convenience store. He cooked the last box of mac and cheese yesterday after school. Besides, he had seven dollars burning a hole in his pocket. \n        Jason pursued the aisles of the mini mart. Having selected a bubble gum soda and a pack of gummy bears, Jason made a beeline for the baseball cards. The bells on the door jingled. A plume of cigarette smoke entered the store before the patron. Jason let out a small gasp and ducked behind a magazine rack. \n        His uncle strode through the door in his stained white undershirt and faded jeans. A cigarette dangled from his lip. He winked and flashed a gap-tooth grin to the lady behind the counter. He headed right to the beer case and grabbed two six packs. \n        Jason carefully peeked around the corner. He didn’t think his uncle would rat him out if he saw him. Heck, he probably wouldn’t even recognize him. Nonetheless, he couldn’t risk his mom finding out about his detour. He would never see the light of day again.\n        Kenny put the six-packs on the counter. “Two packs of Menthol Smooths,” he mumbled.\n        The cashier rang up his purchase. He reached into his pocket and threw some cash on the counter. “Keep the change,” he said as he walked out the door.\n        He flung his cigarette on the ground and stomped it out with the pointed toe of his worn cowboy boot. He jumped in his car and peeled out of the parking lot. \n        The cashier counted the cash three times. “That jerk stiffed me two dollars!” she shouted to no one in particular. It didn’t matter. Kenny was long gone. \n        Jason paid for his haul and stuffed everything in his backpack. As he approached the high school football stadium, he saw a familiar car in the parking lot. Kenny perched on the hood of his station wagon. A group of four young people laughed and drank the six packs with Kenny. Jason put his head down and raced by. \n        When he got home, Jason flopped on the couch and took his soda and snacks out of his backpack.  He settled in to watch Brady Bunch reruns. \n        His parents arrived home. Dad shooed Jason off the couch and switched the TV to the nightly news. Jason shuffled down the hallway to his room. The cord from the phone in the kitchen stretched into Jennifer’s bedroom. Jason looked in the slightly open door at Jennifer’s walls plastered with posters. She sat at her desk, polishing her nails and gossiping to her friend about her other friends. \n        Mom called them for dinner. The phone rang immediately after she placed the headset in the cradle. She swiped the phone from her mom’s reaching hand. \n        “Hello,” she answered. “Oh, hey, Mrs. Wilson. Huh, uh, she isn’t over here. Umm, yeah, she was in fifth period today. Yeah, I’ll tell her if I see her. Bye.”\n        “What was that about?” Mom asked.\n        “Oh, Amanda hasn’t made it home,” Jennifer said nonchalantly. \n        Their mother looked worried. \n        “She totally ran off with Jack. Her mom couldn’t reach him either. They’re totally going to elope before graduation.” \n        Jennifer continued to educate the family about how Jack is a dead beat and Amanda could do so much better. Jason pushed his spaghetti and meatballs around his plate with his fork. He didn’t know Amanda or Jack, but he wondered if they were part of the group with Uncle Kenny today. \n        “Are you ok, hon?” Mom asked Jason. “You look kind of pale.”\n        “Oh, yeah. I’m just tired. I think I’m gonna lay down, okay?” Jason replied.\n        Later in the evening, Jason’s mom popped in to check on him. He pretended to be asleep. He felt uneasy, but he couldn’t pinpoint it. Maybe it was all the candy.\n        He heard the rattle of his uncle’s station wagon pull up out front. A few minutes later, the back gate slammed. His parents’ muffled voices carried down the hallway. Jason moved closer to the door. \n        “He’s gotta go,” his father said matter-of-factly. \n        “We don’t know that Kenny’s involved with any of this,” she said, defending her brother. \n        “C’mon. Trouble follows him everywhere. You just think it’s just a coincidence? Shreveport, Oklahoma City, here?” \n        “Yes. Yes, I do. He’s a good kid. Just a little mixed up.” His mom’s voice cracked. “I promised my mother I would watch out for him.”\n        “That was when he was fifteen years old. He’s thirty-four. You have your own family now.” His dad struggled to keep his voice down.\n        “Kenny’s still my family.”\n        “Look, I don’t know what he’s up to. Frankly, I don’t wanna know. We have our own kids to watch out for. I don’t want to get caught up in any plot he’s hatched.” I’m going to talk to him.”\n        The sliding door to the backyard squeaked open. Jason waited for the yelling, but it never came. It felt like hours passed as Jason sat with his ear pressed against the bedroom door. It was really only twenty minutes. The back gate crashed shut. Jason hurried to the window. Kenny opened the driver’s door of his station wagon and threw a tattered duffle bag in the passenger seat. He slammed the door and tore off down the street. Headlights disappeared as he screeched around the corner. That was the last Jason saw of his uncle for almost forty years.\n\nApril 2022\n        Jason sat for several minutes in the driveway. He wanted to be with his mom when the news broke. Since his dad had passed last year, she seemed so fragile. He knew the news about her brother would be a devastating blow. \n        A detective for Shreveport PD had contacted Jason last July about a cold case he had reopened. The DNA evidence in a kidnapping investigation showed a 28% match with a DNA ancestry test Jason had submitted a few years back. The percentage was consistent with that of his uncle.\n        He cooperated fully with authorities. He didn't have much information on his uncle. After Kenny left, he lived off the grid for the most part. His mom would occasionally receive a letter, and Jason was able to direct the authorities' attention to a small town outside of Denver. \n        As the investigation closed in and an arrest was imminent, he asked the detective if he could let him know once Kenny was apprehended. He expected it to be a huge national news story, and he wanted to inform his mother before the media did.\n        His mother greeted him with a beaming smile. “What are you doing here unannounced?”\n        “Hi, Mom.” He gave her a kiss on the cheek. \n        “Do you want something to drink?” she asked,\n        He shook his head. His mother joined him on the couch. The furniture was new. The wood paneling was painted. Nonetheless, he was somehow swept back to that night he sat with his ear pressed against his bedroom door.\n        “We’ve got to talk about Kenny,” he said. \n        “Oh dear,” she whispered. The color drained from her face. \n        Jason took her hand. “No, he’s still-”\n        “They caught him, didn’t they?” \n        “Wait. Wha-? How did you -” Jason was speechless.\n        “He couldn’t run forever. It was the Shreveport kidnapping documentary, wasn’t it?”\n        She clicked on the TV. A breaking news ticker crawled across the screen. “Colorado man arrested in connection with 1982 Louisiana kidnapping. Kenneth Butler is the primary suspect in twenty-two kidnappings dating back to 1978.”  Jason’s mother raised her hand to her mouth. She watched her handcuffed brother forced in the back of a police cruiser. \n        “You knew. You knew, clear back to when Dad kicked him out!” Jason clenched his teeth.\n        “He was turning things around. He had a hard life. Your grandfather was so tough on him. And he had to drop out of school…” she trailed off. “I promised to take care of him.” Her voice cracked as it did that night in 1984. \n        “Take care of HIM? What about us? You invited a predator into our home!” \n        “He would never harm you. He would never harm family.”\n        “What about the other kids? The families he destroyed? He’s a monster! You’re a monster for helping him!” Jason cried.\n        Jason’s mother sobbed. “Please, I’m so sorry. You must understand!”\n        Jason turned his attention to the TV. The camera focused close-up on Kenny in the back of the police car. Kenny looked out the window. He grinned and winked at the camera. It was the same gap-toothed grin he gave the woman at the convenience store. \n        Rage filled his heart. He was furious at his mother and at himself too. Furious for convincing himself that Amanda and Jack weren’t at the football stadium with Kenny and had eloped. Furious that he believed his mother’s lies. Furious that he kept his mouth shut. \n        His mom made a half-hearted attempt to comfort him by touching his arm. He yanked it away and stormed out the door. He tore out of the driveway and down the street, just as Kenny did. Tires screeched around the corner.\n        Most of all, he was furious that he bore the burden of protecting his mother when she didn't protect him. \n\n\n\n", "subset": "validation"}, "translate":

"“贾默，你为什么摆弄那个东西？现在不会有人给我们打电话，以后也不会。”\n\n贾默拨开挡住眼睛的头发，叹了口气：“只是因为你不认为事情会好转，斯特普，并不意味着你可以试图熄灭我对我们并不孤单的希望。”\n\n年轻人皱了皱眉，但点了点头。\n\n“再说了，斯特普，世界政府现在相当自信。上一次叛乱是什么时候？二十年前？所有的异议者都被镇压了，所有的偏离者都被消灭了，每个人都成了一个大家庭，被分成他们的工作单位和隶属小组。每个人都有自己的位置，每个人都在自己的位置上，没有人会掉队，对吧？”\n\n斯特普嗤之以鼻：“除了我们，还有那些不合群的人。你会认为世界政府会有统计数据，对吧？你在档案中找到了那些笔记，谈到他们所谓的LGBTQIA人群的百分比？”\n\n“差不多十四分之一，”贾默回答。“我们中一定有很多人，但世界政府确保他们不知道自己是什么。你和我，我们之所以能逃出来，是因为我们在当局抓到我们并重塑我们的思想之前就跑了。他们让我们以为自己是两个女人，穿上漂亮的裙子，鞠躬服务等等。”\n\n斯特普打了个寒颤：“或者让芭比索克斯以为她喜欢男人。”\n\n“没错。世界政府会让我们符合他们对人的想法，不管我们想要什么。我们能逃出来，多亏了艾什。他们的父母是世界政府的快乐小齿轮，但艾什从来不想只做一个性别。我不知道艾什是怎么在世界政府之前发现我们三个人的，但即使是在躲藏和生存中，我仍然很高兴我在这里而不是那里。”\n\n掩体的内门滑开，芭比索克斯欢快地走了进来，肩上平衡着几个帆布包。她没有像往常那样把“解放”的物品扔到地上，而是喊道：“嘿，你们两个帮个忙。这些东西很精致，我不是指漂亮的内衣。”\n\n斯特普立刻站了起来，而贾默小心地放下烙铁并关掉电源，然后站了起来。芭比索克斯在搜寻方面很出色，如果她说某样东西很精致，那很可能是他们无法接触到的技术。\n\n“你是怎么弄到这些东西的？”斯特普带着一点调侃的语气问。\n\n“世界政府关闭了一家诊所，但由于一些官僚错误，清除小组没有立即到达。”\n\n贾默吹了声口哨：“等等，是一家诊所诊所？像医疗扫描仪、手术床之类的东西？”\n\n芭比索克斯眨了眨眼，回答道：“没错。我不能把那里的一切都拿出来，否则会引起不必要的注意，但大多数内部设备都很容易拿到。艾什去年确认世界政府只是把所有东西都扔进粉碎机，所以没人能把它们拿到黑市上。而清除小组在装载之前不会检查重量。”\n\n当斯特普卸下第一个帆布包时，他骂了一句：“你拆了一张手术床吗？要么是这样，要么你从每台机器上拆下了一些内部零件。”\n\n“我想过拆一张床，”芭比索克斯耸了耸肩说，“但那太明显了，我们已经有一张了。你看到的是每样东西中的一个关键电子元件。没有带追踪器的，别问了。我可不想让世界政府把我的朋友变成没有头脑的傀儡，你知道吗？”\n\n内门再次滑开，这次露出了艾什的男孩模式。“大家好。好消息，坏消息，我怕。父母要出去一周，我得跟着他们。”\n\n贾默皱了皱眉，继续拆包，转向第二个帆布包。“很遗憾听到这个，朋友。但有什么好消息？”\n\n“看起来芭比索克斯带来了好消息。我用了我爸的密码来延迟世界政府关闭的一家诊所的清除小组。我无法操控资产清单，”艾什叹了口气，走到屏幕后面换衣服。“但我想也许有足够的东西让我们的手术床运转起来，或许。绕过限制，让它按我们想要的方式工作。你怎么看，贾默？”\n\n贾默查看了一下所有东西，开始慢慢点头。“我觉得可以。应该足够让机器运转起来，让斯特普得到正确的修复。一个属于他的身体，而不是他成长中的身体。”\n\n“这并不意味着我会抛弃你们，”斯特普立刻回应。“世界政府的记录不会把我列为一个男人，而且无论如何，你们是我的朋友。我不会抛弃朋友。”\n\n芭比索克斯把手放在斯特普的肩膀上，轻轻地捏了一下。“从没想过你会这样，斯特普。”她正要说更多的时候，贾默低声长长地吹了声口哨，表示惊讶。\n\n艾什穿着裙子走出来，歪着头。“怎么了？”\n\n“通讯技术。就像，我需要的那块我小型发射机项目的部件，”贾默虔诚地回答。“如果这不会让事情变得尴尬，我会亲吻你，芭比索克斯。”\n\n芭比索克斯行了个屈膝礼，就像世界政府教导被认定为女性的人那样，笑了。“好吧，我的直觉是对的。我知道你，你不是在谈论我想要的那种吻，但真诚的感谢会走很长的路。”她在搜寻来的沙发上坐下，慢慢地呼出一口气。“你真的认为那个发射机会有效吗？”\n\n贾默稍微向后靠了靠，思考了一下。“我们都知道从我们找到的那个档案中的故事。一百年前，人类曾因像我们这样的人而发生过一场大战。那些像我们一样的人，或者支持我们的人，试图让事情变得更好，但其余的人变成了世界政府，把他们赶走。不过，他们秘密建造了星舰，并拯救了他们能拯救的人。并说他们会在未来回来找我们，因为人类总是不断生育，而像我们这样的人实际上是正常的，而不是世界政府所说的偏离者。”\n\n斯特普叹了口气，开始把电子设备放进他们临时的架子里。“听起来不错，但他们之前不会回来吗？这就是为什么我不知道这是否会有效，贾默。”\n\n他们点了点头，完成了第二个帆布包的清空。“我知道。但我在逃跑之前建造的那个接收器？它接收到了除了背景辐射之外的东西。”贾默举起了那块珍贵的技术。“技术应该是相似的。我知道我可以建造一个接收器，而档案中的信息告诉我如何建造一个受保护的发射机。现在只是把它们组合在一起的问题。”他们看向斯特普。“当然是在让床工作之后。床，然后是发射机。”\n\n他环顾房间，然后看向贾默。艾什和芭比索克斯沉默地看着两人，满脸担忧。\n\n最后，斯特普说：“如果他们在那里，他们有一百年的时间来改进世界政府使用的技术。你需要多长时间来建造你的发射机？”\n\n贾默开始微笑。“几个小时，也许更少。”\n\n芭比索克斯呼出一口气。“只要床是下一个，我就没问题。斯特普需要这个已经很多年了。”她看向贾默。“你也是，虽然。艾什不能，至少现在不能，因为他们的父母会注意到。但别以为我没看到你对身体不适合你的部分叹气。”她看向艾什。“说到这个，你还有多久？”\n\n他们耸了耸肩，裙子微微晃动。“我的父母-走狗后天离开。我在一个朋友家，我们在为入学考试学习。杰森一直在掩护我，我信任他。”\n\n斯特普点头。“好吧，先是发射机，然后让床运转起来。我应该出去搜寻一些食物。市场差不多该开始扔掉未使用的东西了，如果芭比索克斯愿意再出去一趟，我们可以在你完成的时候带回几天的补给，贾默。”当年轻女子点头时，斯特普笑了。“有什么要求吗？我想无论发生什么，我们都会想要一场小小的盛宴。”\n\n艾什在两人离开后坐在沙发上，静静地看着贾默组装他们设计的发射机。根据档案中的蓝图，由于技术在过去一个世纪中有所进步，进展缓慢。但当斯特普和芭比索克斯带着食物回来时，发射机已经准备好了，安静地嗡嗡作响。在那一个半小时里，艾什换了几次衣服，需要适应他们的性别变化，现在穿着一条从服装店搜救来的运动黑色紧身裤和无袖长袍。\n\n贾默帮忙收拾食物，边做边有些兴奋。斯特普很安静，但芭比索克斯填补了空白，讲述了他们在逃离世界政府之前认识的各种人的八卦。他们找到的掩体在地下，是在战争期间建造的，当时有城市毁灭性武器的威胁，然后在世界政府接管后被遗弃。它仍然有足够的电力供他们生活，随着时间的推移，斯特普重新布置了其他必要的设施，使它足够成为他们三人躲避世界政府的家。\n\n最后，艾什、斯特普和芭比索克斯坐在沙发上，这是唯一能容纳他们的地方，而贾默坐在一把搜救来的椅子上，开始将设备调到他们最后识别的频率。几乎立刻，一个声音开始说话，不完全是男性或女性。\n\n“——我们在地球周围有监测站，监听你的信号。我们希望极权主义国家没有压制你们所有人，希望你们中的一些人能找到这个信息并回应。我们在这里，我们是酷儿，我们是自由的，你们也可以。我们只需要你们回应。我们会回到地球，但我们不能在没有确定有像我们这样的人需要我们的情况下回来。信息结束，信息明天在此频率重复。”\n\n四人震惊地互相看着。\n\n“世界政府肯定已经压制这个信息几十年了，”斯特普低声说。\n\n艾什脸色苍白。“我爸爸在世界政府中地位很高，我从来没有听到过这个消息的任何风声。”\n\n芭比索克斯突然站起来，开始踱步。“他们当然会隐藏它！他们当然会控制所有的通讯！他们不能冒险让任何人听到这个信息！”她转向贾默，点了点头。“我们必须回应。我们能在不暴露掩体位置的情况下做到这一点吗？”\n\n贾默花了几秒钟才回答，但他们点了点头。“我计划发送信息已经很多年了。它会从整个城市发出，因为我设计得无法缩小到具体位置。但我们只有一次机会；如果我再这样做，世界政府会找到方法找到掩体。”\n\n斯特普眨了眨眼，泪水顺着脸颊流下。“我们该对他们说什么？”\n\n艾什深吸了一口气，说：“我们在这里，我们是酷儿，我们需要你的帮助。”他们笑了笑。“用他们的一些话，确保他们听到我们。”\n\n当其他人点头同意时，贾默编码了信息，然后发送了出去。\n\n晚上剩下的时间里，四人在掩体里忙碌着。几乎立刻，新闻广播变黑，被世界政府更明确的宣传取代，要求任何好公民举报他们怀疑的“恐怖袭击”者。贾默决定专注于让手术床运转起来；艾什既是跑腿的，也是一些更密集维修的第二双手。芭比索克斯监控他们的摄像头，关注公共广播，并在间隙中摆弄他们的逃生包。斯特普决定为小组做饭，所以他们都休息了一下吃晚饭，尽管他们都没有特别饿。\n\n午夜过后不久，贾默宣布床准备好了。但在他们能问斯特普是现在进去还是等到早上之前，房间里的空气发生了变化，压力突然增加和减少。房间角落里持续播放的宣传画面变黑，四个朋友互相看着，充满不安。\n\n黑屏突然亮起，出现了一个与世界政府从未在他们的摄像机前展示过的人。这个人的脸看起来像是世界政府会标记为“坚定的男性化”和“精致的女性化”的混合体，他们穿着的衣服似乎是某种制服，但没有世界政府偏爱的明显军事特征。\n\n“地球上的人们，大家好，”这个人开始说。“一个世纪前，我们被你们现在称为世界政府的人赶出了地球。在他们追求所谓的意识形态纯洁的过程中，他们决定消灭所有不合群的人，并在他们控制地球的几十年里继续这种做法。我代表联盟，我们一直在等待世界政府永远不会允许的求助请求。但在某个地方，你们中的某个人向我们伸出了援手，我们回来了。”这个人微笑着。“我们在这里，我们是酷儿，我们带来了从极权主义国家解放的希望。”\n\n当贾默盯着屏幕时，他们的发射机启动了，声音与屏幕上的人相同。“世界政府就在附近。我们正在派遣一艘飞船来接你们，那个勇敢地向我们发送信息的人，但我们需要你们做好准备。只带上你们能携带的东西，但一定要带上你们的发射机。前往有湖的大空地，我们的飞船会在那里找到你们。勇敢点，自由即将到来。”\n\n瞬间，四人抓起他们的逃生包，朝门外走去，贾默最后一个带着发射机。\n\n当他们沿着通往地面的隧道奔跑时，斯特普勉强说：“抱歉我不相信你，贾默。”\n\n“先逃出去，之后再道歉，”贾默回答。"}

I have to say, again this is not the best time for a road trip because my new Weimaraner puppy is about sixteen weeks old, and already a big butter ball at twenty-five pounds. Flutter, my puppy, has only been with me a couple of weeks, but my friend really needed a break for the long weekend so here we are, in the car together.\n        The drive is not as bad as what it could have been. Flutter did not get sick in the car, nor did she eat the seats in the back. However, she is grumpy and wants out of the car. So do I. My friend pulls into the parking lot of the hotel. We park, get our bags, and go in. The hotel clerk thinks our little silver puppy is the cutest thing ever. It is a pet-friendly hotel. They give us our room key, and we make our way up to the twelfth floor.\n        Once in our room, we get settled. I give Flutter some food and water. We wait while she eats, and then I take her for a walk. When we get back to the room, I show Flutter her toys and bowl of water. I put her puppy blanket on one of the beds. My friend puts on the television so that she has some background noise, and we go out to eat. \n        Dinner is very stressful for me. I imagine all the destruction a little dog can do to a hotel room. I’m terrified as we approach our room door. As we approach the room, I can hear the television playing some happy movie. My friend and I go in, and to my surprise, everything is just fine. Relieved, I take Flutter for a walk. When I come back, we get ready for bed. She sleeps with me under the covers.\n        We are really excited to go to the beach today. My friend and I get ready as quickly as we can. It is a little cold, but no problem, we are not here to swim, we just want to walk along the shore and take in the view. I feed Flutter as we are getting ready. We go downstairs, and I load Flutter into the car. She is happy to be with us.\n        My friend  and I stop at a donut shop to get some donuts and coffee. Happily, when we return, Flutter is sleeping off her breakfast. The car is still in one piece. We make the short drive to the ocean and park the car. Flutter is all too excited to be coming out with us. \n        The three of us make our way to the beach with Flutter running to and fro between us. Her tail is wagging. When we get to the beach, we are the only people there. No surprise, it is a chilly day. I decide I can let Flutter off her leash. She runs like a mad dog once free. I get a little nervous and call her back. Luckily, she runs right to us. She loves me, and she knows I have treats in my pocket. Then she goes to where the waves are meeting the shore and begins to explore.\n        It is so cute to watch her in the surf. She does not seem to mind the cold temperature of the water on her paws. I watch her as she starts to dig in the sand. Flutter gets so upset because whatever she is digging up is buried again with the next wave. It is colder than my friend and I thought, and they suggest we head back to the car to get some lunch. I call Flutter, but she does not come, she is too busy digging.\n        I go over to her and see her digging project. Just beneath the sand there is an ugly cream and beige rock. She digs for it, and the water comes and buries it again. I watch this process a couple of times and think I should just get the rock for her. Yet, she is so intent on this project, I watch her a bit more, careful to move back when the waves come so my shoes do not get wet. Eventually, to my surprise, she figures out how to make a massive effort of digging when the wave recedes. She finally gets the rock free and is so excited. \n\tI go over to her and pick it up. It is large, just bigger than the palm of my hand, and probably five pounds. It is very ugly. The rough rock is yellow, cream, and beige. Flutter is jumping up to my hand to put her nose on the rock. There is only one thing I can do, I wash the rock in the wave water, and then I put Flutter on the leash. She watches the rock in my hand as we make our way back to the car.\n\tIt has been eleven years since that day at the ocean. Flutter is now a seventy-five pound dog and my best friend. The rock is my paper weight. When I write, and I am anxious,  I hold it. The ugly rock is now smooth from years of being held. From time to time, when Flutter sees me holding it, she comes up and licks it. She seems to know it is her rock. \n\tAnother friend of mine needs help, and so Flutter and I packed our things to go be with them for a while. It has not been an easy time for Flutter and I. My friend is not really a dog person. I don’t think they are a people person either. However, each morning when I start work, I put Flutter’s rock beside my computer. It is part of my morning routine. Finally, we are ready to leave, as my friend is now situated.  Flutter and I are both so relieved. I pack our things, and we are on our way back home.\n\tThe trip back is exhausting. I unpack our things, but I can’t find the rock. I look everywhere, and start to panic. I call my friend who can’t understand why I’m upset over a rock. I try to tell them it is my lucky writing rock that Flutter found in the ocean, and please look where my computer was, or in the room that I stayed in. They said they would do that for me, but not today. \n\tSo Flutter and I must wait to see if her missing rock is found. I hope it will be found. In my heart, I can’t believe it is gone forever. I imagine having it as a reminder of Flutter when she is no longer with me. It is a rock to most people, to me, it contains years of memories of her and I together, starting at the ocean. \n", "subset": "trian"}, "translate": "写一个故事，讲述某样非常重要的东西失踪了。主人公有一只小狗。她和她的朋友带着小狗去了海边。在那里，小狗在挖掘时发现了一块又大又丑的石头。主人公把石头留下来，用作多年的镇纸。十一年过去了，主人公去帮助另一个朋友。她把石头带上了，却不小心把它落在了朋友家。她打电话给朋友，让他们帮忙找找石头。朋友告诉她稍后会去找。主人公相信朋友会找到石头。然而，并不确定石头是否真的在朋友家。用第一人称视角写这个故事。字数应在1100到1200之间。", "inputs_translate": "写一个故事，讲述某样非常重要的东西失踪了。主人公有一只小狗。她和她的朋友带着小狗去了海边。在那里，小狗在挖掘时发现了一块又大又丑的石头。主人公把石头留下来，用作多年的镇纸。十一年过去了，主人公去帮助另一个朋友。她把石头带上了，却不小心把它落在了朋友家。她打电话给朋友，让他们帮忙找找石头。朋友告诉她稍后会去找。主人公相信朋友会找到石头。然而，并不确定石头是否真的在朋友家。用第一人称视角写这个故事。字数应在1100到1200之间。", "targets_translate": "这不是一个适合开车旅行的时间，我和朋友决定一起去海边，那里离我们住的地方大约四小时车程。我不得不说，这确实不是一个适合公路旅行的好时机，因为我的新魏玛犬幼犬大约十六周大，已经是个二十五磅的大胖球了。我的小狗Flutter和我在一起才几个星期，但我的朋友真的需要一个长周末的休息，所以我们就在车上了。\n\n这段旅程并没有想象中那么糟糕。Flutter没有在车里晕车，也没有啃后座。然而，她有些烦躁，想要下车。我也是。我的朋友把车开进酒店的停车场。我们停车，拿上行李，走进去。酒店的接待员觉得我们的小银色小狗是见过的最可爱的。这里是宠物友好型酒店。他们给了我们房间钥匙，我们上了十二楼。\n\n一进房间，我们就安顿下来。我给Flutter一些食物和水。我们等她吃完，然后我带她出去散步。回到房间后，我给Flutter看她的玩具和水碗。我把她的小狗毯子放在一张床上。我的朋友打开电视，让房间有些背景声音，然后我们出去吃饭。\n\n晚餐对我来说非常紧张。我想象着一只小狗能对酒店房间造成的所有破坏。当我们接近房间门时，我感到很害怕。随着我们接近房间，我能听到电视里播放着一部快乐的电影。我和朋友走进去，令我惊讶的是，一切都很好。我松了一口气，带Flutter出去散步。回来后，我们准备睡觉。她和我一起在被窝里睡觉。\n\n今天我们真的很兴奋要去海滩。我和朋友尽快准备好。天气有点冷，但没关系，我们不是来游泳的，只是想沿着海岸走走，欣赏风景。我在准备的时候给Flutter喂食。我们下楼，我把Flutter放进车里。她很高兴和我们在一起。\n\n我和朋友停在一家甜甜圈店，买了一些甜甜圈和咖啡。高兴的是，当我们回来时，Flutter正在睡她的早餐。车子还完好无损。我们短途开车到海边，把车停好。Flutter非常兴奋能和我们一起出来。\n\n我们三个人一起走向海滩，Flutter在我们之间来回奔跑。她的尾巴摇摆着。当我们到达海滩时，只有我们在那里。毫不奇怪，天气很冷。我决定可以让Flutter脱掉牵引绳。一旦自由，她就像疯狗一样奔跑。我有点紧张，叫她回来。幸运的是，她直接跑向我们。她爱我，并且知道我口袋里有零食。然后她走到海浪拍打岸边的地方，开始探索。\n\n看她在海浪中玩耍真是太可爱了。她似乎不在意水在她爪子上的寒冷。我看着她开始在沙子里挖掘。Flutter非常沮丧，因为无论她挖出什么，都会被下一波浪潮再次掩埋。天气比我和朋友想象的要冷，他们建议我们回车里吃午饭。我叫Flutter，但她没有来，她太忙于挖掘了。\n\n我走过去看她的挖掘项目。就在沙子下面有一块丑陋的奶油色和米色的石头。她挖着它，水来时又把它埋住。我看了几次这个过程，想着我应该为她拿到这块石头。然而，她对这个项目如此专注，我多看了一会儿，小心地在浪潮来时后退，以免鞋子弄湿。最终，令我惊讶的是，她想出了一种方法，在浪潮退去时进行大规模挖掘。她终于把石头挖出来了，非常兴奋。\n\n我走过去捡起它。它很大，比我的手掌还大，可能有五磅重。它非常丑陋。粗糙的石头是黄色、奶油色和米色的。Flutter跳起来，把鼻子放在石头上。只有一件事我能做，我在海浪水中洗净石头，然后把Flutter拴上牵引绳。当我们走回车里时，她盯着我手中的石头。\n\n自从那天在海边已经过去十一年了。Flutter现在是一只七十五磅的狗，是我最好的朋友。那块石头是我的镇纸。当我写作时，感到焦虑，我会握着它。经过多年的握持，那块丑陋的石头现在变得光滑了。不时地，当Flutter看到我握着它时，她会上来舔它。她似乎知道那是她的石头。\n\n我的另一个朋友需要帮助，所以Flutter和我收拾好东西去陪他们一段时间。对Flutter和我来说，这段时间并不容易。我的朋友不太喜欢狗。我觉得他们也不太喜欢人。然而，每天早上当我开始工作时，我把Flutter的石头放在我的电脑旁。这是我早晨的例行公事。最后，我们准备离开，因为我的朋友现在已经安顿好了。Flutter和我都感到如释重负。我收拾好我们的东西，我们踏上了回家的路。\n\n回程令人疲惫。我卸下我们的东西，但找不到那块石头。我到处找，开始惊慌。我打电话给我的朋友，他们不明白我为什么为一块石头感到不安。我试着告诉他们那是Flutter在海里找到的我的幸运写作石，请看看我的电脑放在哪里，或者我住的房间。他们说会为我找找，但不是今天。\n\n所以Flutter和我必须等待，看看她丢失的石头是否能找到。我希望能找到。在我心里，我不相信它会永远消失。我想象着当Flutter不再和我在一起时，它能作为她的一个提醒。对大多数人来说，它只是一块石头，对我来说，它包含了我和她在一起的岁月记忆，从海边开始。"}
